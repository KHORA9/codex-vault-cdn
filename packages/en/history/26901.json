After a generation of war and\r\nturmoil France was started on her new career of parliamentary government.\r\nThe brief period of retaliation ended with the so-called amnesty act of\r\nJanuary, which condemned Napoleon and all his relatives to perpetual exile.\r\nThe Chambers now entered into a prolonged discussion of the propositions\r\nfor a new election law. The Ministry was headed by the Duc de Richelieu,\r\nwho had taken the place of Talleyrand and Fouché. The latter was compelled\r\nto leave France forever. Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr, who succeeded Davoust,\r\nreorganized the army on a permanent footing of military equality which\r\nsatisfied even Napoleon's veterans. In the Chambers, the Comte d'Artois\r\nrepresented the ultra-royalist right wing, while the left was brilliantly\r\nled by Lafayette, Manuel, and Benjamin Constant. Guizot, during the same\r\nyear, for the first time ascended the tribune as spokesman of the moderate\r\nparty--the so-called Doctrinaires. Chateaubriand so offended the king by\r\nhis book \"La Monarchie selon la Charte\" that his name was crossed from the\r\nlist of the Council of State. Yet he remained the foremost man of letters\r\nin France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Béranger]\r\n\r\nBéranger was the foremost lyric poet. A typical song by him is that\r\nrendered by Thackeray:\r\n\r\n  With pensive eyes the little room I view,\r\n    Where, in my youth, I weathered it so long;\r\n  With a wild mistress, a stanch friend or two,\r\n    And a light heart still breaking into song:\r\n  Making a mock of life, and all its cares,\r\n    Rich in the glory of my rising sun,\r\n  Lightly I vaulted up four pair of stairs,\r\n    In the brave days when I was twenty-one.\r\n\r\n  Yes; 'tis a garret--let him know't who will--\r\n    There was my bed--full hard it was and small;\r\n  My table there--and I decipher still\r\n    Half a lame couplet charcoaled on the wall.\r\n  Ye joys, that Time hath swept with him away,\r\n    Come to mine eyes, ye dreams of love and fun;\r\n  For you I pawned my watch how many a day,\r\n    In the brave days when I was twenty-one.\r\n\r\n  And see my little Lizette, first of all;\r\n    She comes with pouting lips and sparkling eyes;\r\n  Behold, how roguishly she pins her shawl\r\n    Across the narrow easement, curtain-wise;\r\n  Now by the bed her petticoat glides down,\r\n    And when did woman look the worse in none?\r\n  I have heard since who paid for many a gown,\r\n    In the brave days when I was twenty-one.\r\n\r\n  One jolly evening, when my friends and I\r\n    Made happy music with our songs and cheers,\r\n  A shout of triumph mounted up thus high,\r\n    And distant cannon opened on our ears:\r\n  We rise,--we join in the triumphant strain,--\r\n    Napoleon conquers--Austerlitz is won--\r\n  Tyrants shall never tread us down again,\r\n    In the brave days when I was twenty-one.\r\n\r\n  Let us be gone--the place is sad and strange--\r\n    How far, far off, these happy times appear;\r\n  All that I have to live I'd gladly change\r\n    For one such month as I have wasted here--\r\n  To draw long dreams of beauty, love, and power,\r\n    From founts of hope that never will outrun,\r\n  And drink all life's quintessence in an hour,\r\n    Give me the days when I was twenty-one!\r\n\r\nIt was the period of a new revival for French literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reaction in southern Europe]\r\n\r\nIn the other Latin countries, Spain, Portugal and Italy, the restoration of\r\nthe old monarchies was not attended by like beneficent results. In Spain,\r\nthe re-establishment of the Inquisition stifled free thought and free\r\nspeech to such a degree that some of the most progressive Spaniards\r\nemigrated to the revolted Spanish dependencies in America. The return of\r\nBourbon rule in Naples and Sicily was made odious by a general suppression\r\nof Freemasons and kindred secret societies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Metternich's influence]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German Confederation established]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Frankfort Diet]\r\n\r\nIn the German States, similar measures of persecution were invoked against\r\nthe student societies at the universities. The University of Erfurt was\r\nsuspended. The Duke of Hesse, who had gained early notoriety by renting his\r\nsubjects to foreign armies, now revived corporal punishment together with\r\nthe stocks and other feudal institutions. In Wurtemberg serfdom was\r\nre-established. Throughout Germany the reactionary suggestions of Prince\r\nMetternich were carried into effect. A good opportunity for Metternich to\r\nassert his ascendency was presented by the first session of the new German\r\nDiet. Late in the year the delegates from all the States of the New\r\nGermanic Confederation met at Frankfort, Austria holding the permanent\r\npresidency. Count Buol von Schauenstein opened the Diet with a solemn\r\naddress, which fell flat. First of all, it was settled that Hesse would\r\nhave to cede a large part of Westphalia to Prussia. Next, the title of the\r\nDuke of Cambridge to rule as Regent in Hanover was fully recognized. In\r\nall resolutions relating to fundamental laws, the organic regulations of\r\nthe Confederation, the _jura singulorum_ and matters of religion, unanimity\r\nwas required. All the members of the Confederation bound themselves neither\r\nto enter into war nor into any foreign alliance against the Confederation\r\nor any of its members. The thirteenth article declared, \"Each of the\r\nconfederated States will grant a constitution to the people.\" The sixteenth\r\nplaced all Christian sects on an equality. The eighteenth granted freedom\r\nof settlement within the Confederation, and promised \"uniformity of\r\nregulation concerning the liberty of the press.\" The fortresses of\r\nLuxemburg, Mainz and Landau were declared common property and occupied in\r\ncommon by their troops. A fourth fortress was to be raised on the Upper\r\nRhine with twenty millions of the French contribution money. This was never\r\ndone. For future sessions of the Diet the votes were so regulated that the\r\neleven States of first rank alone held a full vote, the secondary States\r\nmerely holding a half or a fourth of a vote, as, for instance, all the\r\nSaxon duchies collectively, one vote; Brunswick and Nassau, one; the two\r\nMecklenburgs, one; Oldenburg, Anhalt, and Schwartzburg, one; the petty\r\nprinces of Hohenzollern, Lichtenstein, Reuss, Lippe, and Waldeck, one; all\r\nthe free towns, one; forming altogether seventeen votes. In constitutional\r\nquestions the six States of the highest rank were to have each four votes;\r\nthe next five States each three; Brunswick, Schwerin, and Nassau, each two;\r\nand all the remaining princes each, one vote. This arrangement, as it\r\nturned out, proved fruitful of endless trouble.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unfair representation]\r\n\r\nAustria and Prussia at that time contained forty-two million inhabitants;\r\nthe rest of Germany merely twelve million. The power of the two predominant\r\nStates, therefore, really were in proportion to that of the rest of Germany\r\nas seven to two, whereas their votes in the Diet stood merely as two to\r\nseventeen, and in the plenary assembly as two to fifteen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussia predominant]\r\n\r\nThough Prussia had lost Hanover and East Friesland, she had received\r\nsufficient compensation still--thanks to Hardenberg's diplomacy--to start\r\nher on her future career as the predominant German State. Incorporated with\r\nthe Prussian provinces now were half of Saxony, the Grandduchy of Posen, a\r\nportion of Westphalia, nearly all of the Lower Rhine region from Mainz to\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, and Swedish Pomerania, for which Prussia paid some eight\r\nmillion thalers by way of indemnity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Restoration of the Netherlands]\r\n\r\nIn Holland, the new Stadtholder, Prince William Frederick of Orange-Nassau,\r\nhaving incorporated Belgium as an integral part of the kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands, set himself to nullify the French racial traits of his Belgian\r\nsubjects. A suggestion of future strife on this score could already be\r\nfound in Van der Palm's memorial on \"The Restoration of the Netherlands,\"\r\npublished during this year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: England's commanding position]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Industrial depression]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Art and Letters]\r\n\r\nThe final settlement of Napoleon's great upheaval of Europe left England\r\nfeverish and exhausted. The prolonged financial strain of twenty years of\r\nwar had saddled Great Britain with a national debt of eight hundred million\r\npounds. Of material gain there was little to show but the acquisition of\r\nCeylon and the Cape of Good Hope from the Dutch; of the former French\r\ncolony of Mauritius, and of a few West Indian islands. The continued\r\npossession of the Rock of Gibraltar, and of Malta, the old stronghold of\r\nthe Knights of Malta, together with the British protectorate over the Ionic\r\nIsles, assured to England her commanding position in the Mediterranean. At\r\nhome the pressure of the heavy taxes required to meet the financial\r\nlegacies of the war was imbittered by the general distress of the country.\r\nThe new tax on the importation of grains resulted in famine prices.\r\nCorresponding tariff restrictions abroad kept British markets overstocked\r\nwith goods. Mills and factories had to be shut down, while at the same time\r\nthe labor market was glutted with several hundred thousand discharged\r\nsailors and soldiers. The starving working people grew bitter in their\r\nopposition to new labor-saving devices. Thus the appearance of the first\r\nsteamship on the Thames and of the earliest ships constructed of iron,\r\nfollowed shortly by Sir Francis Reynold's invention of an electric\r\nclock-work telegraph and by James Watt's introduction of stereo plates in\r\nbook-printing, heightened this feeling. The resentment of laboring men\r\nfound expression in riotous meetings at Manchester, Littleport and\r\nNottingham. The movement spread to London. A great labor meeting was held\r\nthere on the Spa fields. The favorite newspaper of the workingmen,\r\nCobbett's radical \"Two Penny Register,\" rivalled the London \"Times\" in\r\npower. In Parliament the leaders of the radical opposition grew ever more\r\nimportunate. Not until the end of the year did matters mend. The most\r\ncomforting sign of better times was a partial resumption of specie payments\r\nby the Bank of England, followed shortly by the opening of the first\r\nSavings Bank in London. Other memorable events of the year were the\r\nacquisition of the famous Elgin marbles from the Parthenon in Athens,\r\ncelebrated in Keats's sonnet \"On Seeing the Elgin Marbles,\" and the\r\npublication of Shelley's long poem \"Alastor,\" and Leigh Hunt's \"Story of\r\nRimini.\" A diplomatic setback pregnant with future trouble was the\r\ndismissal of Lord Amherst, the British Ambassador at Pekin, for refusing to\r\nkow-tow to the Emperor of China.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Depression in America]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial relief measures]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tariff _vs._ Free Trade]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in New England]\r\n\r\nIn America the depression of commerce and industry resulting from the war\r\nwith England continued unabated. To relieve the situation, the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, A.J. Dallas, proposed as a measure of relief the chartering\r\nof a new national bank with increased capital and enlarged powers and the\r\nreadjustment of the tariff by the imposition of higher duties. The bank was\r\nchartered for twenty-one years with a capital of $35,000,000, a portion of\r\nthe stock to be owned by the government and the institution to have in its\r\nmanagement five government directors in a board of twenty-five. The tariff\r\npolicy of Madison was sustained by the Southern party and opposed by the\r\nFederalists, especially in New England. Thus it became more a question of\r\nsectional interests than of abstract political economy. The capital of New\r\nEngland was invested in shipping, so that the exclusion of articles of\r\nforeign production was bound to injure, by a high tariff, New England's\r\ncarrying trade. On its part, the South sought to establish a home market\r\nfor its cotton--almost the only staple of the Gulf States. Efforts were\r\nmade to encourage the domestic manufacture of those coarse fabrics which\r\nwere indispensable in a slave-holding region. The question thus grew into a\r\nstruggle between slave labor and free trade. The free-trade party was led\r\nby Daniel Webster, and the tariff party by Calhoun. During the first year\r\nof the new tariff the value of foreign imports fell off about thirty-two\r\nper cent. In the adjustment of capital and trade to an enforced industrial\r\npolicy, the American people passed through a commercial crisis which\r\nparalyzed the flourishing sea-ports of the New England coast. Newburyport,\r\nSalem, Plymouth, New London, Newport, and intermediate places sank from\r\nlucrative commercial centres into insignificant towns. Manchester, Lowell,\r\nFall River, Pawtucket, Waterbury and other New England cities on the other\r\nhand became great manufacturing places.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth American Congress, under the leadership of Clay, imposed a\r\nprotective tariff of about twenty-five per cent on imported cotton and\r\nwoollen goods, with specific duties on coal and iron. The average duties on\r\nimports amounted almost to prohibition. Late in the year Indiana was\r\nadmitted as the nineteenth State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with Florida Indians]\r\n\r\nThe tranquillity of the end of Madison's administration was broken by new\r\ntroubles with the southern Indians. General Jackson by his impulsive\r\nmanner of dealing with the Indians of Florida nearly forced the United\r\nStates into a war with Spain and England. The Indians had reason to\r\ncomplain of the injustice that had marked their treatment by the whites.\r\nFlorida had become a refuge for runaway slaves from Georgia and South\r\nCarolina. The treaty of 1814 was repudiated by many of the Creeks, who\r\nresented the new settlements of the whites. Those who were most\r\ndissatisfied made common cause with the Seminoles. For a year, General\r\nGaines, in command at the frontier, complained to the authorities at\r\nWashington of the conduct of the Indians and Spaniards. General Jackson, to\r\nwhom the matter was referred, wrote to Gaines that the forts standing in\r\nSpanish territory \"ought to be blown off the face of the earth, regardless\r\nof the ground they stand on.\" In July, a detachment of men and gunboats\r\nunder Colonel Church advanced upon Fort Negro. A shot from one of the boats\r\nblew up the powder magazine. The fort was laid in ruins. Of the 324 inmates\r\n270 were killed. Most of the survivors were wounded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Gouverneur Morris]\r\n\r\nDuring this year, the \"Washington,\" the first American line-of-battle ship\r\nput to sea with seventy-four guns on her decks. The first American rolling\r\nmill and plant for puddling iron-ore were built at Red Stone Bank in\r\nPennsylvania. Bishop Asbury, the founder of Methodism in the United States,\r\npreached his last sermon at Richmond, Virginia. During the same year he\r\ndied at the age of seventy-one. Other noted Americans who died this year\r\nwere Gouverneur Morris of New York, and Spaulding, the reputed author of\r\nthe book of Mormon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Miranda]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Independence of Argentine]\r\n\r\nMiranda, the South American revolutionist, expired on July 14, in a dungeon\r\nat Cadiz. A British officer who saw him shortly before his death, described\r\nhim as \"tied to a wall with a chain about his neck like a dog.\" Ever since\r\nhis defeat and detention in Venezuela, his last years had been spent in\r\ncaptivity. He passed from prison to prison--now at San Carlos, now in Porto\r\nRico, and finally in Spain. Miranda's failure to obtain grants of amnesty\r\nfor Bolivar and his fellow rebels, when he came to terms with the Spanish\r\ngeneral Monteverde, left him discredited with the patriots of South\r\nAmerica. In the meanwhile, Miranda's friend, San Martin, was fighting in\r\nChile and Peru for South American independence, and was aided in his\r\nstruggle by Louis Beltran, an unfrocked friar. On July 9, the independence\r\nof Argentine was proclaimed. Pueyrredon was made President of the new\r\nrepublic. Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia established independent\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The struggle in Venezuela]\r\n\r\nAfter Miranda's defeat and the fall of Porto Cabello, Bolivar had fled to\r\nCuraçoa. He enlisted a corps of refugees in Cartagena and headed an\r\nexpedition into New Granada. There he rallied more revolutionists about\r\nhim, and, capturing Madalena from the Spaniards, fought his way through to\r\nCaracas. He was welcomed there with extravagant demonstration as the\r\n\"Savior of Venezuela.\" After one more victory on the field of Araure his\r\nstar declined. The Spanish general, Boves, defeated him at La Puerta, and\r\ntook a terrible vengeance on the patriots. The wounded and prisoners were\r\nkilled on the field; the homes of all reputed rebels were burned to the\r\nground; and the entire population of Aragua was massacred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish vengeance]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bolivar's adventures]\r\n\r\nMontalvo, the Spanish War Minister, reported officially: \"General Boves\r\ndoes not distinguish between the guilty and innocent--soldiers or\r\nnon-combatants. All alike are killed for the crime of being born in\r\nAmerica.\" Bolivar retired to New Granada and thence to Jamaica. An attempt\r\nto assassinate him there failed; for the negro cut-throat who had\r\nundertaken to murder Bolivar killed the wrong person. Bolivar crossed over\r\nto Hayti. There he raised a new expedition. A negro leader, Petion, then\r\nacting-governor of Hayti, helped him in this enterprise, and strongly\r\nadvised him to proclaim the freedom of all slaves as the first step on\r\nlanding in his country. \"For, how can you free your country,\" said Petion,\r\n\"if you don't free all the people in it?\" Bolivar heeded his advice. With\r\nsix ships and one hundred and fifty men, he set out to reconquer Venezuela\r\nfrom Spain. He landed at Margerita, where he had the good fortune to\r\ncapture several Spanish ships. With them he returned to Santo Domingo for\r\nmore men and ammunition. Petion furnished him with funds. Thus reinforced,\r\nBolivar made a dash for Barcelona in Venezuela. The end of the struggle was\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1817\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return of Bolivar]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Piar shot]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: O'Higgins]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: San Martin]\r\n\r\nBolivar landed on the north coast of Venezuela on the first day of the new\r\nyear. His landing place, Barcelona, was a small town at the foot of the\r\nMaritime Andes, so unprotected against attack that he resolved to leave it\r\nat once. He marched his force in the direction of Santa Fé in New Granada,\r\nhoping to push through to Peru. Marino and Piar, two insurgent leaders\r\noperating in the south, joined forces with Bolivar, and brought 1,200\r\nadditional men. By the time their joint column had penetrated well into\r\nOrinoco, the three leaders were at odds with each other. Piar tried to\r\nincite revolt among his followers. Bolivar caused Piar to be seized, and\r\nafter a drum-head trial had him shot. In the meanwhile a Spanish force had\r\nswooped down on Barcelona, and massacred the inhabitants. Things were at\r\nthis pass when the standard of revolt was once more raised in Chile by\r\nBernado O'Higgins. He was a natural son of Ambrosio, and had just returned\r\nfrom school in England. At the time the supreme command of the\r\nrevolutionary forces was given to him this famous South American leader was\r\nstill a young man, as was his chief lieutenant, MacKenna. By his clever\r\nhandling of the campaigns that followed he won the title of \"El Primer\r\nSoldado del Nuevo Mundo\"--the first soldier of America. It was still at the\r\noutset of his career, in 1817, that help came to the Chileans from Buenos\r\nAyres across the Andes. The man who brought this aid was San Martin.\r\n\r\nAt Mendoza, on January 17, San Martin reviewed his little army of 5,000,\r\nall Gaucho horsemen, as lightly clad and provisioned as the Indians of the\r\nPampas. The women of Mendoza presented the force with a flag bearing the\r\nemblem of the Sun. San Martin held the banner aloft, declaring it \"the\r\nfirst flag of independence which had been blest in South America.\" This\r\nsame flag was carried through all the wars along the Pacific Coast. And\r\nunder its tattered shreds San Martin was finally laid to rest sixty years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Chacabuco]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Acuoncagua]\r\n\r\nMarching from Mendoza, San Martin made a feint of crossing the Andes by way\r\nof Planchon, thereby inducing a Spanish column under Captain-General Marco\r\ndel Ponte to concentrate at Talca. During the progress of these movements,\r\nSan Martin and his followers crossed the mountains by the steep route of\r\nPutaendo and Cuevas. Three hundred miles of the stiffest mountain riding\r\nwere covered in less than a fortnight. Early in February, San Martin's\r\narmy, now barely 4,000 strong, descended upon Villa Nueva. On February 7,\r\nthey fought their first battle on Chilean soil with the Spanish outposts at\r\nChacabuco. Driving the Spaniards before him, San Martin, advanced into the\r\nplain, and presently joined forces with O'Higgins' infantry. New mounts\r\nwere provided for the cavalry. At the strong post of Acuoncagua the\r\nSpaniards made a stand, but they were outnumbered by the insurgents. San\r\nMartin delivered a frontal attack, while O'Higgins outflanked the enemy\r\nwith an impetuous charge, with the result that the whole Spanish force was\r\nrouted beyond recovery. The officers fled to Valparaiso. By the middle of\r\nFebruary, San Martin entered Santiago de Chile. A new republican junta was\r\nformed and complete independence of Spain was declared. O'Higgins assumed\r\nthe position of dictator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Talca]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of the Maypo]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liberation of Chile]\r\n\r\nAll Chile was free now except in the south. General Ordoñez, commanding the\r\nSpanish forces there, was defeated and fell back to Talcahuano. San Martin\r\nprepared to invade Peru. Anticipating such an attack, Abascal, the Spanish\r\nViceroy of Peru, despatched Osorio with an expedition of 3,500 veterans,\r\nwho had just arrived from Spain, to Talcahuano. As soon as these\r\nreinforcements came, Ordoñez set out from Talcahuano with the vanguard to\r\nmarch on Santiago de Chile, and met the patriot forces near Talca. The\r\nrevolutionists largely outnumbered the Spaniards, but were poorly\r\ndisciplined and ill-provisioned. While they lost time the Spanish main\r\ncolumn under Osorio came up. Ordoñez took advantage of the clumsy\r\nmanoeuvres of the revolutionists to drive a sharp attack between their\r\ntwo wings, piercing their centre. The battle was won after the first\r\nfifteen minutes. O'Higgins was wounded and had to be carried out of the\r\nfight. San Martin, with his right wing, fell back on San Fernando. With\r\ngreat difficulty O'Higgins managed to reach Santiago, where he was\r\npresently joined by San Martin. Steadily the Spanish column advanced on\r\nSantiago. The two revolutionary leaders by almost superhuman efforts\r\nsucceeded in rallying and equipping a force of 5,000 defenders. On April 5,\r\nthe Spanish army appeared before Santiago de Chile. Near the Maypo, nine\r\nmiles from Santiago, the revolutionists took up a strong position. Osorio\r\nopened the battle about noon with artillery. Soon all the troops were\r\nengaged, the fiercest fight raging around a hacienda where San Martin and\r\nO'Higgins had their headquarters. Several times the ranch was lost and\r\nretaken. By sundown the Spaniards advanced all along the line. The battle\r\nseemed lost to the patriots. At this juncture, as the famous regiment of\r\nBurgos on the Spanish right was drawing in its deployed lines for a final\r\ncolumn attack, Colonel O'Brien, at the head of the insurgent cavalry\r\nreserves, charged into the opening and overthrew the Burgos battalions.\r\nO'Higgins immediately charged the rest of the Spanish right wing, and San\r\nMartin simultaneously attacked in the centre. The whole Spanish army gave\r\naway. More than 2,000 Spaniards were killed and wounded. Osorio with his\r\nstaff escaped to Peru. The victory of Santiago not only freed Chile, but\r\nleft Peru open to the revolutionists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monroe's Presidency]\r\n\r\nIn the United States of North America, during this interval, a new\r\nPresident had begun his administration. James Monroe was inaugurated as\r\nPresident in his fifty-ninth year. He had been a member of the Continental\r\nCongress, and at thirty-six a Minister to France. Under Madison he served\r\nas Secretary of War. Crawford, Calhoun, Meigs, Wirt and Rush were members\r\nof his Cabinet, and were all of the dominant Democratic-Republican party.\r\nBusiness throughout the country began to revive almost at once when the\r\nre-chartered National Bank went into operation in Philadelphia on the day\r\nof Monroe's inauguration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Era of good feeling\"]\r\n\r\nIn June, President Monroe undertook a three months' personal inspection of\r\nthe military posts of the country. Passing through New York, Boston and\r\nPortland, and crossing New Hampshire and Vermont to Ogdensburg, he took a\r\nboat to Sackett's Harbor and Niagara. From there he went to Buffalo and\r\nDetroit, and returned to Washington. Everywhere the people greeted him by\r\nthousands. Monroe on this occasion wore the three-cornered hat,\r\nscarlet-bordered blue coat and buff breeches of the American Revolutionary\r\narmy. The \"Boston Journal\" called the times the \"Era of Good Feeling,\" and\r\nthe expression has passed into American history as a characteristic of\r\nMonroe's entire administration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Western prairies settled]\r\n\r\nIt was an era notable for the extraordinary growth of the Western States.\r\nSettlers were encouraged to buy government land on the instalment plan, and\r\nthe States refrained from levying taxes on these lands until years after\r\nthe settlers had received their title deeds. Endless processions of prairie\r\nwagons passed through New York and Pennsylvania. On one turnpike alone,\r\n16,000 vehicles paid toll during the year. Pittsburg at this time had a\r\npopulation of 7,000 persons. The log cabin was the house of all, with its\r\nrough chimney, its greased paper in a single window, its door with latch\r\nand string, a plank floor and single room, corn husk brooms and its Dutch\r\noven. In the newly broken ground corn and wheat were planted, which, when\r\nharvested, were thrashed with the flail and winnowed with a sheet. Little\r\nsettlements sprang up here and there on the rolling prairie, with\r\nstore-taverns, blacksmith shops and mills. This a thousand times repeated\r\nwas seen in western New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Steam navigation]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Erie Canal]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Thanatopsis\"]\r\n\r\nDuring the same year the newly organized territory of Mississippi, formed\r\nfrom a division of Alabama, was admitted as the twentieth State to the\r\nUnion. The first line of steam propelled ocean packets was organized to run\r\nbetween New York and Liverpool. In the western frontier town of St. Louis\r\nthe first steamboat made its appearance. On July 4, ground was broken for\r\nthe Erie Canal, which was to connect the city of New York with the great\r\ninland waters. On the strength of this progressive achievement De Witt\r\nClinton became a candidate for the governorship of New York. Among other\r\nnotable events of this year were the foundation of the New York State\r\nLibrary, Gallaudet's foundation of the first school for the deaf and dumb\r\nat Hartford, and the establishment of the earliest theological seminaries\r\nof the Episcopal Church in America, as well as of the first Unitarian\r\nDivinity School at Harvard. William Cullen Bryant, barely come of age,\r\npublished his master work, \"Thanatopsis,\" in the \"North American Review.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stenography]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German liberalism]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wartburg festival]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: European courts alarmed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advances in scholarship]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: African missionary work]\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the world, likewise, the return of peace was followed by\r\na general advance in culture and civilization. Shortly after the\r\nre-establishment of the American National Bank, Canada followed suit with\r\ngovernment banks at Montreal and Quebec. Hanka, in Bohemia, claimed to have\r\ndiscovered the famous medieval lyrics of Rukopis Kralodvorsky written at\r\nthe end of the thirteenth century. Across the border in Poland the new\r\nUniversity of Cracow began its career. In Munich, Franz Gabelsberger\r\ninvented the first working system of shorthand, which, in a perfected form,\r\nis still in use in Germany. During this year common school education took\r\nan immense stride in Germany, after the establishment in Prussia of a\r\ndistinct Ministry for Public Education. Unfortunately the government soon\r\ncame into conflict with the bolder spirits at the universities. By reason\r\nof the more liberal privileges allowed to it by the Duke of Weimar, the\r\nUniversity of Jena took the lead in the national Teutonic agitation\r\ninaugurated by Fichte. On October 18, the students of Jena, aided by\r\ndelegates from all the student fraternities of Protestant Germany, held a\r\nfestival at Eisenach to celebrate the three-hundredth anniversary of the\r\nReformation. It was also the anniversary of the battle of Leipzig. Five\r\nhundred ardent young men, among them scholars who had fought at Leipzig,\r\nLigny and Waterloo, assembled in the halls of Luther's Wartburg Castle.\r\nThey sang and drank, and fraternized with the members of the militia of\r\nEisenach. In the evening they had a torchlight procession and lighted a\r\nhuge bonfire on the hill opposite the castle. In imitation of Martin\r\nLuther's burning of the Pope's Bull they consigned a number of their pet\r\naversions to the flames. Thus they burned a soldier's straight-jacket and\r\ncorporal's cane, as well as a recent pamphlet by one Schmalz written in\r\ndefense of the old Prussian bureaucracy. Rash words were uttered about the\r\nbroken faith of princes. They were aimed at King Frederick William of\r\nPrussia, who had promised to give his country a constitution, but had\r\nfailed to keep his word. The Wartburg festival, childish as it was in many\r\nof its manifestations, created singular alarm throughout Germany and\r\nelsewhere. The King of Prussia sent his Prime Minister, Hardenberg, to\r\nWeimar to make a thorough investigation of the affair. Richelieu, the Prime\r\nMinister of France, wrote from Paris whether another revolution was\r\nbreaking out; and Metternich insisted that the Duke of Weimar should\r\ncurtail the liberties of his subjects. The heavy hand of reaction fell upon\r\nall German universities. German scholars were compelled to turn their\r\ninterests from public affairs to pure science and scholarship, to the\r\nbenefit of German learning. The study of history and archeology took an\r\nupward turn with Brentano's publication of old German ballads and\r\nLachmann's original version of the Nibelungen songs. At this time an\r\nItalian archeologist, Belzoni, was adding new chapters to ancient history\r\nby his original researches in Egypt, which resulted in the removal of the\r\nColossus of Memnon to Alexandria, and in the opening of the great Cephren\r\npyramid. In distant South Africa the first English missionaries began their\r\nlabors among the blacks. Although the Governor of Natal at first refused to\r\npermit Robert Moffat, the first Wesleyan missionary in those parts, to\r\ndisturb the Kaffirs with his preachings, Moffat pressed on undismayed and\r\nsoon established a mission beyond the Orange River.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Green Bag inquiry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manchester Blanketers]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissatisfaction in England]\r\n\r\nIn England, industrial depression dragged on. Early in the year riots broke\r\nout in London on the opening of Parliament. While driving to the House of\r\nLords, the Prince Regent, now grown thoroughly unpopular on account of the\r\nscandals with his wife, was hooted by a crowd in St. James's Park. The\r\npolice claimed that an air gun had been discharged at the Prince and made\r\nan attack on the crowd. A number of persons were injured. This was followed\r\nin February by the great Green Bag Inquiry, when Lord Sidmouth laid before\r\nParliament a green bag full of reports concerning seditions. Bills were\r\nintroduced to suspend the habeas corpus act and to provide for the coercion\r\nof public meetings. Seditious publications were likewise to be suppressed.\r\nIn March occurred the rising of the so-called Blanketers in\r\nManchester--dissatisfied workingmen who started in a body for London\r\ncarrying blanket rolls and other necessaries. Their march was stopped by\r\nthe military. In April, seven members of the so-called society of Luddites\r\nwere hanged at Leicester for breaking labor-saving machinery. Shortly\r\nafterward eighteen persons were hanged for forging notes on the Bank of\r\nEngland. It was found that since the redemption of specie payments no less\r\nthan 17,885 forged notes had been presented. Nearly two hundred persons\r\nwere apprehended and tried in court for this offence. Shortly afterward\r\nanother insurrection which broke out in Derbyshire, and which was led by\r\nJeremiah Brandrett, was suppressed by soldiers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Revolt of Islam\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Lalla Rookh\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Keats]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Blackwood's\"]\r\n\r\nWhile the working classes of England and Ireland were thus struggling\r\nagainst their miseries, English literature shone forth in new splendor.\r\nShelley brought out his \"Revolt of Islam\" and Tom Moore published his\r\n\"Lalla Rookh.\" John Keats at the age of barely twenty-one published his\r\nfirst poems. The volume attracted little attention. The appearance of\r\nBlackwood's new magazine in Edinburgh, on the other hand, was hailed as an\r\nevent in English letters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French letters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Béranger]\r\n\r\nIn France, likewise, the return of peace gave a new lease of life to\r\nliterature. The French Academy was reorganized to consist of forty members,\r\nwho were elected for life, and who were to be regarded as \"the highest\r\nauthority on questions relating to language, grammar, rhetoric, poetry and\r\nthe publication of the French classics.\" Chateaubriand was the Academy's\r\nforemost member. Béranger on the other hand, albeit his lyrics had reached\r\nthe height of their popularity, fell into official disfavor by reason of\r\nhis glorification of Napoleonic times, as exemplified in his ballads \"La\r\nVivandière,\" \"La Cocarde Blanche,\" or \"Le Juge de Charenton.\" The last\r\npoem, with its veiled allusions to the Lavalette episode, was made the\r\nsubject of an interpellation in the Chamber of Deputies. While this was\r\nstill pending further offence was given by the publication of Béranger's\r\nsatirical piece on \"The Holy Alliance.\" Béranger had to give up his\r\nposition as secretary at the University of France, and was soon afterward\r\narrested among his boon companions at Madame Saguet's near Le Moulin Vert.\r\nHe was placed on trial for the alleged blasphemies committed in his song\r\n\"Le Dieu des Bonnes Gens,\" and condemned to spend three months in prison\r\nand to pay a heavy fine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Madame de Staël]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Masséna]\r\n\r\nOther literary events of the year were the publication of Beyle's \"Lives of\r\nMozart and Haydn\"; the performance of Scribe's early plays, and the death\r\nof Madame de Staël, which occurred on July 14. This gifted daughter of\r\nNecker had not been allowed to return to France until after the fall of\r\nNapoleon. Her last work was a treatise of the Constitutional Government,\r\nentitled \"Considerations sur les Principaux Evénements de la Révolution\r\nFrançaise,\" and published posthumously by her long time German companion\r\nand adviser, Schlegel. Marshal Masséna died during the same year. His\r\nfuneral was attended with imposing military honors rendered him by his old\r\nfollowers and comrades-in-arms, who recalled the triumphs of Rivoli,\r\nEssling, and a score of other victories in which this famous warrior had\r\nborne the brunt of the fighting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wachabite rebellion]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seminole war]\r\n\r\nThis year would have been one of peace, the first since the outbreak of the\r\nFrench Revolution, but for another uprising of the Wachabites in Arabia\r\nunder the standard of Tourkee and the re-occurrence of North American\r\nIndian troubles. A year had passed after the destruction of Fort Negro in\r\nFlorida before the whites found a pretext for another attack. King Natchez\r\nwas accused of receiving fugitive negroes, and he replied: \"I have no\r\nnegroes.... I shall use force to stop any armed American from passing my\r\nlands or my towns.\" The Seminoles looked with alarm on the new forts of the\r\nUnited States. At Fowltown, on Flint River, the Indians, in November, put\r\nup a war pole, and the chief warned Colonel Meigs in command at Fort Scott\r\nnot to cross the Flint River. Gaines reached the place with some regular\r\ntroops and volunteers, and Twiggs, with 250 men, moved upon the town,\r\nkilled some of the people and burned the village. The revenge of the\r\nSeminoles was swift and bloody. Settlers were massacred and the property of\r\nthe whites within reach of the Indians was destroyed. Over 2,700 Seminoles\r\ntook the field. General Jackson assumed command on the day after Christmas.\r\nHe declared that so long as the Spaniards held Florida the trouble would\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pindaree war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Toona]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the British in India were plunged into further wars\r\nwith the natives. First the Pindarees sent out plundering bands from Malwa.\r\nTo suppress them, Lord Hastings had to collect an army of 120,000, the\r\nlargest force yet mustered in India. From Madras, four army divisions under\r\nSir Thomas Hislop crossed the Nerbudda, and drove the Pindarees toward\r\nBengal. By the great number of his remaining troops Lord Hastings overawed\r\nthe neighboring rulers, Peishwa Sindia of the Mahratta, Ameer Khan, Holkar\r\nand Runjit Singh of the Punjab. Peishwa Baji Rao was compelled to sign a\r\ntreaty of neutrality at Toona. In October, thereupon, Lord Hastings left\r\nCawnpore and crossed the Jumna. The Pindarees were routed in a series of\r\nswift-fought engagements. One of their chieftains, Khurin, gave himself up\r\nwith his whole household, while another, Chetu, was killed by a tiger while\r\nhiding in the jungle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mahratta war]\r\n\r\nThe Peishwa of the Mahrattas, who was biding his time until the British\r\nforces should withdraw from his dominions, grew impatient and threatened\r\nopen war. To appease him a newly arrived British regiment was withdrawn\r\nfrom Toona to Khirki, a village about four miles from the British\r\nResidency. This concession only encouraged the Peishwa to further\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hindu Blondin]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outbreak of Poonah]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of Baji Rao]\r\n\r\nThe Mahratta war opened with a romantic incident. Trimbukji Dainglia, one\r\nof the favorites of the Peishwa, was held closely confined by the English\r\nat Thanna for his share in the murder of one of Baji Rao's enemies. Before\r\nthe outbreak of hostilities the Mahrattas managed to get word to him of\r\nwhat was coming. A native groom in the service of one of the British\r\nofficers passed the window of the prisoner every day leading his master's\r\nhorses. As he did so he trolled a native song the purport of which the\r\nBritish guards neither understood nor suspected. It has thus been\r\ntranslated by Bishop Heber:\r\n\r\n  Behind the bush the bowmen hide\r\n    The horse beneath the tree.\r\n  Where shall I find a chief to ride\r\n    The jungle paths with me?\r\n\r\n  There are five-and-fifty horses there,\r\n    And four-and-fifty men;\r\n  When the fifty-fifth shall mount his steed,\r\n    The Dekhan thrives again.\r\n\r\nA few days after this Trimbukji Dainglia was missing. He had broken a bar\r\nfrom its setting, scaled the wall, and joined a party of horsemen lying in\r\nwait. With them he fled to the jungles of Kanderish. Just before the\r\noutbreak of hostilities a British officer thought he recognized him at\r\nPoonah. On November 5, the British Resident, Elphinstone, left Poonah to\r\ninspect the forces at Khirki. On that same day the Mahrattas burned\r\nElphinstone's house and rich Sanskrit library. Baji Rao attacked the\r\nmilitary post Khirki with 26,000 men, but was repulsed with a loss of five\r\nhundred. The British immediately despatched an army under General Smith for\r\nPoonah. On November 15, they prepared for a general attack on the morrow,\r\nbut in the night Baji Rao fled from Poonah. Thus he surrendered his\r\ndominions without a blow.\r\n\r\nAppa Sahib, the Rajah of Nagpore, meanwhile had made common cause with Baji\r\nRao. On the evening of November 24, he brought up his forces and attacked\r\nthe British Residency at Nagpore. The resulting battle of Sitaboldi is\r\nfamous in Hindu annals. As Wheeler, the historian of British India,\r\ndescribes it:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Sitaboldi]\r\n\r\n\"The English had no European regiment, as they had at Khirki; they had\r\nscarcely fourteen hundred Sepoys fit for duty, including three troops of\r\nBengal cavalry, and only four six-pounders. Appa Sahib had an army of\r\neighteen thousand men, including four thousand Arabs, the best soldiers in\r\nthe Dekhan; he had also thirty-six guns. The battle lasted from six o'clock\r\nin the evening of the 26th of November until noon the next day. For many\r\nhours the English were in sore peril; their fate seemed to hang upon a\r\nthread. The Arabs were beginning to close round the Residency, when a happy\r\nstroke of British daring changed the fortunes of the day. Captain\r\nFitzgerald, who commanded the Bengal cavalry, was posted in the Residency\r\ncompound and was anxious to charge the Arabs; but he was forbidden. Again\r\nhe implored permission, but was told to charge at his peril. 'On my peril\r\nbe it!' cried Fitzgerald. Clearing the inclosures, the Bengal cavalry bore\r\ndown upon the enemy's horse, captured two guns, and cut up a body of\r\ninfantry. The British Sepoys hailed the exploit with loud huzzahs, and\r\nseeing the explosion of one of the enemy's tumbrels, rushed down the hill,\r\ndriving the Arabs before them. The victory was won, but the English had\r\nlost a quarter of their number.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LAST MOMENTS OF MAXIMILIAN\r\n    Painted by J. Paul Laurens\r\n    From Carbon Print by Braun, Clement & Co., N.Y.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appa Sahib's escape]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Nahidpore]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defence of Korygaun]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Mahratta rule]\r\n\r\nAppa Sahib surrendered himself and was placed under arrest. Presently he\r\nmade good his escape and found a refuge with the Rajah of Jodhpur. In\r\nHolkar's State of Indore affairs ran in a similar groove. The Regent Mother\r\nshowed herself inclined to come to an agreement with the British marching\r\nnorthward under Sir Thomas Hislop. But the Mahratta chiefs were bent on\r\nwar, and murdered the Regent Mother. A battle, henceforth, was unavoidable.\r\nAlready the British supply train had been plundered by the Mahrattas. The\r\nbattle was fought on December 21, at Nahidpore. On each occasion Sir John\r\nMalcolm commanded the British troops and won a complete victory. All the\r\nHindu guns and swords fell into British hands. Then came the heroic defence\r\nof Korygaun, still celebrated in British Indian annals. A detachment of\r\nBombay Sepoys and native cavalry, under the command of Captain Staunton and\r\nten English officers, in all 800 men with two guns, were caught unawares by\r\nthe Peishwa's army of 30,000 Mahratta Gosains. Captain Staunton's force\r\nintrenched itself in the village of Korygaun and prepared for the worst.\r\nThe Mahrattas completely surrounded the place and the defenders were cut\r\noff from all water and supplies. Then came a succession of fierce rushes by\r\nthe Mahratta horse and foot, every one of which had to be fought off in\r\ndesperate hand-to-hand encounters. Of the ten white officers eight were\r\nkilled; besides them Staunton lost one-third of his Sepoys. The Mahrattas\r\nleft 600 on the field. To the present day the exploit is celebrated in the\r\nsongs and stories of the Dekhan. The Peishwa witnessed the long fight from\r\na neighboring hill, and was beside himself when his discouraged troops\r\nrefused to renew the battle. After this Baji Rao could no longer hold his\r\narmy together. By the close of the year his forces were dispersed. It was\r\nthe end of Mahratta rule in the Dekhan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1818\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Ashti]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baji Rao's surrender]\r\n\r\nPeace was re-established in India shortly after New Year's day. Lord\r\nHastings would stop at nothing but the absolute deposition of the Peishwa.\r\nHe had long resolved to reduce Baji Rao to the condition of Napoleon at St.\r\nHelena. Accordingly, he delivered the Rajah of Satara from the thraldom of\r\ngenerations, and assigned to him sufficient territory for support. This\r\ndone he set himself to hunt down the deposed Peishwa. For several months\r\nBaji Rao remained at large. He made a feeble stand at Ashti, but fled at\r\nthe first shot, leaving his army to be defeated by General Smith. It was on\r\nthis occasion that the Rajah of Satara fell into English hands. Later in\r\nthe year Baji Rao was surrounded by British troops, under the command of\r\nSir John Malcolm. No alternative was left him but to die or give up. The\r\nterms offered by Malcolm were so liberal as to excite astonishment in\r\nEurope. While the great Napoleon was condemned to spend his remaining days\r\non a mere pittance at St. Helena, this most cowardly of Indian princes was\r\nallowed to live in luxury near Cawnpore, on a yearly grant of £80,000. His\r\nfriend Trimbukji Dainglia, however, when captured, was condemned to close\r\nconfinement in the fortress of Chunar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Hastings' Indian policy]\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Holkar states were permitted to endure, nor would\r\nHastings sanction the proposed dethronement of the family of Jaswant Rao.\r\nHolkar was merely required to seize certain territories, and to confirm the\r\ngrants already made to Ameer Khan. From a sovereign principality the land\r\nwas reduced to a subsidiary state under British guarantee. Otherwise the\r\ninfant Mulhar, Rao Holkar, was treated as an independent prince and his\r\nadministration was left in the hands of a native Durbar, aided by the\r\nBritish Resident. The policy of Lord Hastings, although severely criticised\r\nin England, must be pronounced a success in the light of later events. From\r\nthe suppression of the Pindarees and the extinction of the Peishwa in 1818,\r\ndown to the days of the great mutiny, no serious attempt was made to\r\noverthrow British suzerainty by means of an armed confederation of native\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nIn some respects the administration of Lord Hastings marks a new era in the\r\nhistory of India. Hastings was the first Governor-General who encouraged\r\nthe education of the native population. Early in his administration he\r\ndenounced the maxim of his predecessors, that native ignorance would insure\r\nthe security of British rule, as an utterly unworthy and futile doctrine.\r\nAccordingly, he promoted the establishment of native schools and\r\npublications.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Warren Hastings]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hastings' career]\r\n\r\nThe affairs of India were kept before the British public by the renewed\r\ndiscussion that followed the death of Lord Hastings' great namesake, Warren\r\nHastings. It was due to the scandals of Warren Hastings' career in India,\r\nand his famous impeachment toward the close of the previous century, that\r\nthe administrative reforms and modern rule in India were inaugurated during\r\nthe nineteenth century. This reform began with the act, known at Pitt's\r\nBill, by which the British Crown assumed supreme authority over the civil\r\nand military administration of the affairs in India by the British East\r\nIndia Company. Henceforward, no alliances could be formed with any native\r\nprince without the express sanction of Parliament. This act arose directly\r\nout of Warren Hastings' confession that he had accepted a present of a\r\nhundred thousand pounds from Asof-Ud-Daula. Warren Hastings' record, though\r\nhe was ultimately acquitted, was lastingly besmirched by his dubious\r\nmonetary transactions, and it was for this reason that William Pitt refused\r\nto recommend him for the peerage, or for honorable employment under the\r\nBritish Crown. Yet he was the greatest statesman that ever ruled India. His\r\noverthrow of the French in India, of the first Mahratta rising, and of the\r\nformidable rebellion of Hyder Ali, are among the greatest achievements of\r\nBritish colonial extension. The disgrace of Warren Hastings was a great\r\nevent in English history, but it made no impression on the people in India.\r\nThey only knew him as one of the greatest of conquerors and their\r\ndeliverer. Philip Francis, who brought about Hastings' downfall, so far\r\nfrom supplanting him, is remembered now only as the probable author of the\r\nanonymous \"Letters of Junius.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ross' and Franklin's Expeditions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Frankenstein\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Endymion\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Macadam roads]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invention of Velocipede]\r\n\r\nBesides the death of Warren Hastings, several other notable events\r\npreoccupied the attention of Englishmen. During this year Sir John Ross\r\nsailed north to discover a northwest passage. Another relief expedition\r\nunder Lieutenant Franklin, which had sailed after him, resulted only in\r\nfailure. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley published her curious novel\r\n\"Frankenstein,\" and John Keats brought out his long poem \"Endymion,\" for\r\nwhich he was violently assailed by the critics, notably by Jeffries, of\r\n\"Blackwood's Magazine.\" Shelley, Moore, Hunt, and eventually Byron, warmly\r\ntook his part. In the meanwhile a number of industrial reforms were\r\nintroduced in England. Infant schools were first thrown open during this\r\nyear, and steam was first used for heating purposes. A company in Edinburgh\r\nundertook to light the streets with gas. John Loudon Macadam's new system\r\nof road building was successfully introduced. In France similar strides\r\nwere made in industrial progress. Joseph Nicéphore Niepce invented his\r\nvelocipede. The kindred invention of the \"draisine,\" or dandy-horse was\r\npatented for Baron Drais of Sauerbron. These inventions contained the germ\r\nof the modern bicycle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congress of Aachen]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Czar Alexander aroused]\r\n\r\nThe Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, consisting of the sovereigns of Russia,\r\nAustria and Prussia, aided by ministers of Great Britain and France, signed\r\na convention for the withdrawal of the army of occupation from France, and\r\nfor the reception of France into the European concert. For other countries\r\nthe deliberations of this Congress were not so beneficent. Since the Polish\r\nDiet in the spring, when Alexander had promised to give all Russia a\r\nconstitutional government, a change of spirit had come over the Czar. This\r\nchange has been explained by the revelation of a military conspiracy\r\nagainst his person. At all events, Alexander appeared at Aix-la-Chapelle\r\nwith the most reactionary proposals. Up to this time Metternich, the\r\ninveterate foe of liberalism, had found in the Czar his most formidable\r\nopponent. Now the Czar distributed among his fellow sovereigns a pamphlet\r\nwritten by one Stourdza, which described Germany as on the brink of\r\nrevolution, and blamed the universities and public press. Metternich\r\ninstantly took his cue from the Czar. Before the end of the conference he\r\ndelivered to the King of Prussia and to Hardenberg two papers containing\r\nhis recommendations for the management of Prussian affairs. Frederick\r\nWilliam was warned against giving his people a national parliament. After\r\nthe example of the Czar, Metternich inveighed against the universities and\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Metternich's sentiments]\r\n\r\n\"The revolutionists,\" he said, \"despairing of attaining their end\r\nthemselves, have formed the settled plan of educating the next generation\r\nfor revolution. The high school establishment is a preparatory school for\r\nuniversity disorders. The university seizes the youth as he leaves boyhood,\r\nand gives him a revolutionary training. This mischief is common to all\r\nGermany, and must be checked by joint action of the governments. Gymnasia\r\n(high schools), on the contrary, were first invented at Berlin. For these,\r\npalliative measures are no longer sufficient; it has become a duty of\r\nState for the King of Prussia to destroy the evil. The whole institution in\r\nevery shape must be closed and uprooted.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussian reaction]\r\n\r\nThe reactionary policy outlined in these papers became the guiding star of\r\nKing Frederick William of Prussia. They outline the history of what\r\nactually was carried out in Prussia during the succeeding generation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Misgovernment in Spain]\r\n\r\nIt was not only in Germany that the new spirit of liberalism gave concern\r\nto the members of the Holy Alliance. In Spain it appeared in a more\r\ndangerous form, since it was espoused there by the military class.\r\nFerdinand's misgovernment of Spain had soon resulted in an empty treasury,\r\nin consequence of which soldiers and sailors received no pay for several\r\nyears. Military revolts were instituted by General Mina, and by Porliar and\r\nLacy at this period; but they failed through the indifference of the\r\nsoldiers themselves. The government's attempt to offset the numerous\r\ndesertions from the army by seizing and enrolling some 60,000 beggars in\r\nmilitary service, proved a complete failure. Napoleon's prediction to\r\nRear-Admiral Cockburn that Spain was doomed to lose all her colonies was\r\nreaching fulfilment in America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defection of Spanish colonies]\r\n\r\nAmelia Island, at the mouth of the St. Mary's River in Florida, had long\r\nbeen the resort of lawless men, among whom were European adventurers\r\nattracted by the South American revolution, and many fugitive slaves from\r\nGeorgia and South Carolina. A plan was formed to organize a revolution on\r\nthat island and to add Florida to the revolting South American republics.\r\nThe forces gathered there became too strong for the Spaniards, and\r\nPresident Monroe decided to interfere. Gaines was sent to Amelia Island;\r\nbut before he arrived, Aury, the commander of the malcontents, had\r\nsurrendered to Commodore Henley. General Jackson, who was operating in\r\nthose parts against the Seminoles, declared that \"the cause of the United\r\nStates must be carried to any point within the limits of Florida where an\r\nenemy is permitted to be protected.\" All eastern Florida, he set forth to\r\nthe President, should be seized when Amelia Island was taken, and should be\r\nheld as an indemnity for the outrages of Spain upon American citizens. This\r\nplan, Jackson said, could be carried out without implicating the United\r\nStates. \"Let it be signified to me that the province of Florida would be\r\ndesirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Andrew Jackson in Florida]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary military measures]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pensacola occupied]\r\n\r\nWhen the order to assume command reached Jackson, he raised a volunteer\r\nforce in Tennessee from among his old soldiers. With these and the troops\r\nleft by Gaines he marched into Florida. On the site of the Negro fort he\r\nbuilt Fort Gadsden. He then advanced to the Bay of St. Marks, defeating the\r\nfew Seminoles whom he encountered. On April 7, he raised the American flag\r\nthere in place of the standard of Spain. Two Seminole chiefs who had taken\r\nrefuge on an American vessel in the bay, and who were supposed to have\r\nparticipated in the massacre of a party of Americans, were brought on shore\r\nand hanged. Leaving a strong garrison at St. Marks, Jackson marched a\r\nhundred miles to the Indian town of Suwanee, where he hoped to capture\r\nBilly Bowlegs and his band. But the Indians, warned of his approach,\r\nescaped across the river. Suwanee was destroyed. Jackson, when at St.\r\nMarks, had taken prisoner one Arbuthnot, a Scotchman and supposed Indian\r\nsympathizer, whom he ordered to be confined until his return. At Suwanee,\r\nCaptain Ambrister, a former English officer, intending to join the Indians,\r\nblundered into Jackson's camp, and was held a prisoner. On his return,\r\nJackson ordered the two men to be tried by court-martial, on the charge of\r\nwarning the Indians of the approach of the American soldiers, and both were\r\nconvicted and executed. Jackson, on reaching Fort Gadsden, received from\r\nthe Spanish Governor of Pensacola a protest against his invasion. He turned\r\nback, occupied Pensacola, and took the Fort of Carrios De Barrancas, to\r\nwhich the governor had fled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson unrebuked]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An amicable settlement]\r\n\r\nWhen the news of Jackson's course reached Washington, Congress engaged in a\r\nheated debate over his occupation of the forts of a friendly power. In\r\ndefending himself Jackson wrote that the Secretary of War had given him\r\nfull power to conduct the campaign in the manner which seemed best. Spain,\r\nhe claimed, had failed to fulfil that article of the treaty by which she\r\nwas bound to restrain the Florida Indians from hostilities. Popular feeling\r\nproved too strong for Congress to assert its privileges as the sole\r\nwar-making power. Jackson was not even rebuked for his course. During all\r\nthose months, Onis, the Spanish Minister, and Adams were in negotiation\r\nover a treaty, which was not ratified until two years later. Florida was to\r\nbe ceded to the United States on a payment of $5,000,000, to be applied in\r\nsatisfying the claims of American citizens against Spain. The Sabine River,\r\ninstead of the Rio Grande, was made the dividing line between the United\r\nStates and Spanish territory. The line was to run from the mouth of the\r\nSabine to the 32d parallel, thence north to the Red River and along it to\r\nthe 100th meridian, thence north to the Arkansas and along that river to\r\nits source on the 42d parallel, and thence west to the Pacific. War with\r\nSpain was thus averted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The slavery issue]\r\n\r\nWhile the Florida question was under consideration, there arose another far\r\nmore momentous to America. Free labor in the North and slave labor in the\r\nSouth were brought squarely face to face. Slave labor was fast rising in\r\nvalue. The new lands of the lower Mississippi opened a vast field for the\r\nemployment of slaves in the production of cotton, sugar and tobacco. It was\r\nbelieved the extension of slavery into that new territory would save it\r\nfrom gradual extinction. The interstate traffic in slaves was viewed with\r\nabhorrence by many leading men in the South. John Randolph, while upholding\r\nslavery, denounced the traffic that was carried on in the Southern\r\nplantations. On the other hand it was seen that compromise would be of\r\nlittle value if the North only was to be permitted to increase its power by\r\nthe admission of new States. New slave States as well were demanded by the\r\nSoutherners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contention over Missouri]\r\n\r\nIn March, the citizens of Missouri had asked permission to form a State\r\nconstitution and to be admitted into the Union. It was tacitly understood\r\nthat slavery might be carried into territory east of the Mississippi\r\nbelonging originally to the existing slave States. But Louisiana, west of\r\nthe Mississippi, belonged to the whole of the United States rather than to\r\nany one of the several States. The question now arose whether Congress\r\nshould establish slavery anew in territory of the United States. The\r\nalternative was presented to the people of the North whether to submit to\r\nthe demands of the South or to consent to a dissolution of the Union.\r\nThough represented by a majority in Congress, the Northern States were\r\ndefeated after a long struggle. John Quincy Adams doubted if Congress,\r\nunder the American Constitution, had the right to prohibit slavery in a\r\nterritory where it already existed. \"If a dissolution of the Union should\r\nresult from the slave question,\" he wrote, \"it is obvious that it must\r\nshortly afterward be followed by a universal emancipation of the slaves.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American Pension system inaugurated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oregon in dispute]\r\n\r\nDuring this same year Congress first granted pensions to needy veterans of\r\nthe Revolutionary War and soon afterward to the widows and children of dead\r\nsoldiers. Thus began the system of American pension legislation for former\r\nAmerican soldiers which was destined to grow to such gigantic proportions\r\nin later years. Up to that time the number of stripes in the American flag\r\nhad been eighteen. Now a bill was approved reducing the number of stripes\r\nto thirteen, the number of original States comprising the Union. The\r\nnumber of stars was to be made equal to that of the States. Soon afterward,\r\nthe new flag, with twenty stars in its quartering, was first raised over\r\nthe halls of Congress. Shortly after this the Fifteenth Congress adjourned.\r\nOn October 20, a convention with Great Britain was signed respecting\r\nfisheries and boundaries, giving to Americans the right to fish in\r\nNewfoundland waters and renewing the agreement of 1815, making the 49th\r\nparallel the boundary between the United States and British North America.\r\nThe convention also provided for the joint occupation of Oregon for ten\r\nyears longer.\r\n\r\nThe glossy finish to leather known as \"patent\" leather was first patented\r\nin this year. Another notable invention of the time was the process of\r\nengraving on soft steel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illinois a State]\r\n\r\nThe second session of the American Congress was not called until late in\r\nthe year. Illinois was then admitted as the twenty-first State of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1819\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Florida ceded by Spain]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southern Indians dispossessed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alabama a state]\r\n\r\nEarly in the year Andrew Jackson was called to Washington. He was the hero\r\nof the day. When he visited New York he was received with public honors. On\r\nFebruary 22, a treaty with Spain was adopted by which she surrendered all\r\nclaims to Florida and ceded West Florida. The cost of the war to the United\r\nStates had been forty million dollars. The year was marked by the enforced\r\nretirement of large bodies of the Cherokees from Georgia to the\r\nMississippi. The Cherokees as well as the Creeks, the Choctaws and the\r\nChickasaws were greatly perturbed at the prospect of their final removal\r\nfrom the land which the United States had guaranteed to them. Partly as a\r\nresult of these changes, the Territory of Alabama was admitted to the Union\r\nas the twenty-second State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Missouri problem]\r\n\r\nThere were now eleven free and eleven slave States; and serious opposition\r\narose to the admission of Missouri. In February, the first bill was\r\nintroduced in the House for the admission of that Territory. James\r\nTallmadge, Jr., of New York, proposed that there should be no personal\r\nservitude in the State except by those already held as slaves, and that\r\nthese should be manumitted within a certain period. This proposition he\r\nmodified by moving an amendment providing that the introduction of slavery\r\nshould be prohibited, but that those already slaves in Missouri should\r\nremain so, and that the children of such slaves should be liberated upon\r\nreaching the age of twenty-five. The proposition to hold in slavery a\r\ngeneration yet unborn was fiercely resented. The two Houses did not agree,\r\nand the question went over to another year. The South presented an unbroken\r\nand unyielding front. Caleb of Georgia said that this attempt to interfere\r\nwith slavery was \"destructive of the peace and harmony of the union\"; that\r\nthose who proposed it \"were kindling a fire which all the waters of the\r\nocean could not extinguish. It could be extinguished only in blood.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antagonism to slavery]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maine _vs._ Missouri]\r\n\r\nThe Missouri question having been left for the next session, the cognate\r\nissue concerning a government for the Arkansas country south of parallel\r\n33° 30' was taken up. In both Houses an amendment to prohibit slavery was\r\nlost. As a compromise a representative from Delaware suggested a division\r\nof the Western Territory between the free and slave States. The contest was\r\nrenewed at the December session. Resolutions of Northern Legislatures\r\ncondemning the placing of slavery under the national government were\r\npresented, and were treated with contempt by the Southern statesmen.\r\nSenator Mason of North Carolina said: \"They may philosophize at town\r\nmeetings about it as much as they please, but they know nothing about the\r\nquestion.\" In the House the matter was brought up in the same form as in\r\nthe previous session. James W. Taylor of New York presented an amendment\r\nprohibiting slavery, but holding in bondage those who were already slaves.\r\nHe kept this point clearly in view through the debate that followed.\r\nFinally the bill was passed by a vote of 91 to 82, the prohibitory\r\namendment being adopted by a majority of eight. The bill for the admission\r\nof Missouri was attached to that for the admission of Maine. The suggestion\r\nof this stratagem was made on the 20th of December by Henry Clay, who\r\ndeclared that he did \"not mean to give his consent to the admission of\r\nMaine, so long as the doctrine was upheld of annexing conditions to the\r\nadmission of States beyond the mountains.\" The analogy was scarcely just.\r\nUnder the Constitution the right was absolute; Maine was a part of the\r\noriginal thirteen States of the Republic. The problem respecting Missouri\r\nwas radically different, and resolved itself into the question whether\r\nCongress, under the American Constitution, had the right to create a new\r\nState out of the purchased territory, and to admit it to the Union without\r\na republican form of government. Clay's threat was improved upon. The\r\njudiciary committee reported the House bill for the admission of Maine,\r\nadding an amendment for the admission of Missouri. Roberts of Pennsylvania\r\nmoved to amend the amendment by prohibiting slavery in Missouri, but his\r\nmotion was rejected by a majority of eleven (including six Senators from\r\nfree States). A motion to make the admission of Maine a separate question\r\nwas also defeated. The two Houses now stood directly opposed to each other.\r\nThe Representatives would not retreat from their decision to prohibit\r\nslavery in Missouri; the Senate was equally determined that Missouri should\r\nbe admitted as a slave State. Had the House maintained its ground, the\r\nUnited States for the next half century might have had another history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Missouri compromise]\r\n\r\nSenator Thomas of Illinois, who had voted thus far with the South, now came\r\nforward with a compromise. He proposed to prohibit slavery in that portion\r\nof the Louisiana Purchase north of 36° 30' excepting Missouri. This was\r\naccepted in the Senate by thirty-four votes against ten. But when the bill\r\ncame up two days later for its final passage it received only a majority of\r\nfour. After much delay the compromise measure was finally passed through\r\nthe House by a majority of 134 to 42 votes. The measure was a Northern\r\nvictory, having been carried by Northern votes. For the moment peace was\r\ngained; but the fire was only smothered. On the one side there was a gain\r\nof one slave State; on the other side, a mere promise to prohibit slavery\r\nin future States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern progress]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irving's \"Sketch Book\"]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the political agitation, general progress in America was\r\npronounced and rapid during this period. Steam navigation was no longer a\r\nnovelty. The Erie Canal was well under way. New towns were springing up\r\nalong its course. Blanchard invented his lathe for turning irregular forms.\r\nThe famous Danish physicist, Hans Christian Oersted, made his classical\r\nelectrical experiments with the magnetic needle and laid the foundation of\r\nour modern theory of electromagnetism. The literary event of the year in\r\nAmerica was the appearance of Washington Irving's \"Sketch Book.\" The work\r\nfound favor in England, where Sir Walter Scott befriended Irving.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polar expedition]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cochrane in Chilean service]\r\n\r\nIn England, too, it was a period of new industrial and colonial expansion.\r\nFollowing the unsuccessful polar expeditions of the previous year,\r\nLieutenant Franklin undertook his second search for the northwest passage,\r\nand a similar expedition, under Perry and Liddon, set out for Arctic\r\nwaters. In India, where the Sikhs under Runjeet Singh were engaged in their\r\ngreat conquest of Cashmere, a British settlement was established in\r\nSingapore. British supremacy at sea received its tribute in an invitation\r\nfrom the Chileans to Sir Thomas Cochrane to command their new navy. After\r\ntheir victory on the Maypo, the patriot leaders of Chile had set to work to\r\ncreate a navy for their country. The British ship \"Cumberland\" was\r\npurchased in London, and renamed the \"San Martin.\" Within a few months she\r\ncaptured the \"Maria Isabella\" from the Spanish. The prize was taken to\r\nValparaiso, remounted, and renamed the \"O'Higgins.\" To these ships were\r\nadded the \"Galvarino,\" \"Araucano,\" \"Interpodo,\" and the \"Independencia.\"\r\nWith the \"O'Higgins\" for a flagship, Cochrane took this squadron up and\r\ndown the coast of South America, harrying the Spanish sea-ports everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Six Acts\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Birth of Victoria]\r\n\r\nIn England, meanwhile, there was renewed agitation for Parliamentary\r\nreforms. Henry Grattan in Parliament moved for a Committee of the Whole\r\nHouse to consider the laws excluding Catholics from public offices. His\r\nmotion was defeated by a narrow vote of 243 against 241. Instead of this\r\nreform the British Government, falling in line with the reactionary\r\nmeasures of the Continental governments, passed through Parliament the\r\nso-called \"Six Acts\" for the prevention and punishment of sedition in\r\nEngland. To latter-day Englishmen this year is principally noted for the\r\nbirth of Queen Victoria. The little princess, the daughter of Edward, Duke\r\nof Kent, son of George the Third and Maria Louisa Victoria of Saxe-Coburg,\r\na sister of Leopold I. of Belgium, was born at Kensington Palace, and was\r\nnamed Alexandrina Victoria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schopenhauer]\r\n\r\nGermans of the present day remember this year for the appearance of\r\nSchopenhauer's great philosophic work \"The World, as Will and Idea\"--\"Die\r\nWelt als Wille und Vorstellung.\" Schopenhauer, in this book, laid down the\r\ndoctrine that the universe, and therefore human life as such, is governed\r\nby the conflicting principles of the ungoverned will and of the\r\nunattainable ideal. The true solution of life, he held, was to be found in\r\nsubjecting brute will to the intellectual force of the ideal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assassination of Kotzebue]\r\n\r\nSchopenhauer's book at that time passed almost unnoticed. The educated\r\nclasses of Germany were in too much of a ferment over the recent police\r\nrestrictions inflicted upon the universities and public press. By this time\r\nit had become well known what part Czar Alexander had played at the\r\nCongress of Aix-la-Chapelle. A vehement outcry arose at the universities\r\nagainst the interference of foreigners in German affairs. The wrath of the\r\nLiberals turned against August von Kotzebue, the prolific playwright, who\r\nheld the office of Russian agent in central Germany. Kotzebue conducted a\r\nweekly newspaper at Mannheim in which he inveighed against the German\r\nnational movement of the day, and ridiculed the patriotic eccentricities of\r\nthe students. Having himself studied at Jena, Kotzebue was denounced by the\r\nstudents there as a traitor. He was believed to be responsible for the\r\nCzar's conversion from liberal ideas to reactionary principles. This belief\r\ncost Kotzebue his life. One Sand, a theological student at Jena, noted for\r\npiety and patriotic ardor, formed a fanatical resolution to do away with\r\nthis enemy of the country. An extract from Sand's diary, written on the eve\r\nof his last New Year's day, reveals the character of the man: \"I meet the\r\nlast day of this year in an earnest festal spirit, knowing well that the\r\nChristmas which I have celebrated will be my last. If our strivings are to\r\nresult in anything, if the cause of mankind is to succeed in our\r\nfatherland, if all is not to be forgotten, all our enthusiasm spent in\r\nvain, the evil doer, the traitor, the corrupter of youth must die. Until I\r\nhave executed this, I have no peace; and what can comfort me until I know\r\nthat I have with upright will set my life at stake? O God, I pray only for\r\nthe right clearness and courage of soul, that in that last supreme hour I\r\nmay not be false to myself.\" On March 23, Sand sought out Baron Kotzebue in\r\nthe midst of his family and stabbed him to the heart. Then he turned the\r\ndagger against himself. Unfortunately Sand recovered from his wounds, and\r\nthus lived to die on the scaffold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retaliatory measures]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German liberals persecuted]\r\n\r\nThe mad deed was followed by the worst possible results for Germany.\r\nMinister Hardenberg, when he heard of the murder of Kotzebue, declared that\r\na Prussian Constitution had now been rendered impossible. Metternich, who\r\nwas then in Rome, instantly drew up a scheme for further repressive\r\nmeasures and summoned the ministers of the various German States for a\r\nmeeting at Carlsbad. \"By the help of God,\" wrote Metternich, \"I hope to\r\ndefeat the German revolution, just as I vanquished the conqueror of the\r\nworld. The revolutionists thought me far away, because I was five hundred\r\nleagues off. They deceived themselves; I have been in the midst of them,\r\nand now I am striking my blows.\" A number of innocent persons were arrested\r\nin various parts of Germany under utterly unwarrantable circumstances. The\r\nhouses of professors were searched and private papers were seized. Jahn,\r\nthe founder of the popular Gymnastic schools, was arrested in Berlin. De\r\nWette, a professor of theology at the University of Berlin, had to flee to\r\nSwitzerland on account of a letter of sympathy addressed by him to Sand's\r\nmother. With him Oken, the great naturalist, and Corres, the pamphleteer,\r\nbecame exiles in Switzerland. Professor Fries lost his chair at Jena; the\r\npoet Arndt was suspended at Bonn, and his private papers, in garbled form,\r\nwere published by the government. Many of the younger professors,\r\naccompanied by their favorite students, emigrated to America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convention of Carlsbad]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Police censors appointed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Binzer's poem]\r\n\r\nDuring August the German ministers met at Carlsbad. Their conferences, in\r\nthe memory of the German people, are justly associated with the suppression\r\nof intellectual freedom for a whole generation. It was ordered that in\r\nevery State within the German federation a strict censorship should be\r\nestablished over all publications. Within fifteen days an inquisitorial\r\ncommission was called together at Mainz to investigate the students'\r\nsocieties at the universities. The commission was empowered to arrest any\r\nsubject in any German State. Special police commissioners were appointed at\r\nthe universities, whose duty it was to keep a strict eye on the drift of\r\nthe professor's teachings. Any professor or student expelled from a\r\nuniversity was not to be employed by any other German government. The\r\nstudents' societies were suppressed, at least to all outward appearance.\r\nThe poet Binzer wrote a defiant song ending with the lines:\r\n\r\n  The Spirit liveth in us all,\r\n  For God is still our stronghold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resignation of Wilhelm Humboldt]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South German liberalism]\r\n\r\nSo far was repression carried in Prussia that out of 203 students arrested\r\nfor wearing black-red-yellow ribbons, no less than 94 were condemned to\r\ndeath. Wilhelm von Humboldt, the best and most liberal of Prussian\r\nMinisters during the first half of the nineteenth century, resigned his\r\nportfolio in disgust. The zeal with which the Prussian Government accepted\r\nthese measures made it useless for the minor German States to offer much\r\nopposition. Yet they formed the only remaining bulwark against\r\nMetternich's restrictive policy. In spite of his strenuous opposition, the\r\nrulers of Bavaria and Baden granted to their subjects constitutional forms\r\nof government. Representative assemblies with lower and upper houses, after\r\nthe manner of the English Parliament, were established. In Wurtemberg,\r\nserfdom was abolished, and a constitution was published a few days before\r\nthe enrolment of the decrees of Carlsbad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Laënnec's stethoscope]\r\n\r\nIn France, Dr. Laënnec published his epoch-making work \"Traité\r\nd'Auscultation Médiate,\" the result of his recent experiments in listening\r\nto human heart-beats and lung respirations through a hollow cylinder.\r\nVarious names were given to the instrument until Laënnec decided to call it\r\n\"stethoscope,\" the name it has ever since retained. Laënnec's contributions\r\nto the study of diseases of the lungs, of the heart and of the abdominal\r\norgans may be said to have laid the foundation of modern clinical medicine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decazes Prime Minister]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gregoire episode]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troubles in Spain]\r\n\r\nParliamentary government in France worked none too smoothly. In the\r\nChambers the rise of the independent party and anti-Bourbon faction caused\r\nthe Duc de Richelieu to resign. When the news of Kotzebue's assassination\r\nreached Paris, the Comte d'Artois remarked exultingly to the king: \"Well,\r\nbrother, you see what they are driving us to.\" Louis XVIII. intrusted to\r\nhis favorite, Decazes, the formation of a new Cabinet. Decazes found it\r\ndifficult to select competent men for the various portfolios. His Cabinet,\r\nwhen finally brought together, lacked internal unity and outward support.\r\nIts career was early imperilled by the untoward election of Bishop Gregoire\r\nof Grenoble, one of the regicides, to the Chamber of Deputies. This popular\r\nmanifestation, though sufficiently explained by the sterling public\r\nqualities of the bishop himself, created the utmost apprehension among the\r\nRoyalists. Decazes had to bend to the storm, and the election of Gregoire\r\nwas declared null and void by the Ministerial majority in the Chambers. The\r\nFrench Royalists next professed to find cause for apprehension in Spain.\r\nDanger of war with the United States, before the cession of Florida, had\r\ncaused King Ferdinand of Spain to assemble an army at Cadiz to embark for\r\nAmerica. It was now proposed to send these troops to South America to quell\r\nthe revolutionary movements there. The return of a number of soldiers\r\nstricken with yellow fever in the colonies filled the troops at Cadiz with\r\nconsternation. The common soldiers, lying in squalor and inaction at their\r\nbarracks, came to regard their expected order of embarkation as a sentence\r\nof death. Their officers plotted with the secret societies in Cadiz and\r\nneighboring towns. Abisbas, the commandant at Cadiz, to safeguard his own\r\ninterests pretended to encourage these plots. Then, convinced of their\r\nultimate failure, he arrested the principal leaders by a stratagem and\r\nhurried to Madrid to reveal all and claim credit for saving the crown. The\r\nringleaders were imprisoned and the troops were distributed into\r\ncantonments. As it turned out this only served to foment the growing spirit\r\nof dissatisfaction throughout Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1820\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish military revolt]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Riego's plight]\r\n\r\nNew Year's Day was fixed for the outbreak of revolt by the revolutionists\r\nof Spain. The chosen leaders were Riego, Cabazes and Quiroga. It was\r\narranged that Quiroga, who was held in light confinement at Medina, east of\r\nCadiz, should gather the battalions outside of Cadiz, throw himself into\r\nthe city, and there await the co-operation of his fellow conspirators.\r\nRiego with a band of chosen men was to pounce upon the military\r\nheadquarters at Arcos, and to arrest the general officers before they could\r\ninterfere. Accordingly, Riego, on the first day of January, proclaimed the\r\nConstitution of 1812, and, falling upon headquarters, seized the general\r\nofficers and rallied the men to his standard. Quiroga was less successful.\r\nAfter gaining possession of San Fernando at the eastern point of the\r\npeninsula of Leon, he failed to get into Cadiz. The commandant closed the\r\ngates against him, and the troops within gave no sign of defection. By the\r\ntime Riego arrived, there were but 5,000 insurgents wherewith to overcome\r\nthe strong garrison and fortifications of Cadiz. Leaving Quiroga before\r\nCadiz, Riego set himself to raise the people of the surrounding towns. He\r\nwas received with kindness, but the obvious weakness of his force\r\ndiscouraged others from joining him. Strong forces were sent in pursuit,\r\nand the insurgents were compelled to march back and forth through the\r\ncountry to escape their pursuers. At Cordova, Riego was made to realize\r\nthat the game was lost. The soldiers of the government were upon him, and\r\nhe had only some two hundred followers left. The little band took to the\r\nmountains and there dispersed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spread of the revolt]\r\n\r\nThe revolt, despite its miserable end, was followed by widespread results.\r\nThe example of a bold stroke had been given, and the weakness of the\r\ngovernment had been exposed. While Riego's followers were still hunted from\r\nplace to place, the soldiers and citizens of Corona together declared for\r\nthe Constitution. The revolutionary movement spread to Ferrol and thence\r\nalong the coast towns of Galicia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cochrane's exploit]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abisbas' treachery]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King Ferdinand succumbs]\r\n\r\nIn South America, Cochrane in a brilliant action took the Spanish\r\nstronghold of Valdivia, held to be a Gibraltar in strength. King Ferdinand\r\nin Madrid was terrified. From all points of Spain the commandants wrote\r\nthat they could not answer for their garrisons. Abisbas was ordered to\r\nreturn to Cadiz with reinforcements. On leaving Madrid he boasted to the\r\nking that he knew how to deal with rebels. By the time he reached Ocaña,\r\nearly in March, he himself proclaimed the Constitution. The news of\r\nAbisbas' defection created consternation in Madrid. On the night of March\r\n6, the king convoked his Council of State. On the morrow he issued a\r\nsummons for the Cortes. This was not enough. Crowds gathered in the streets\r\nand clamored for the Constitution. A report that the guards were on the\r\npoint of going over to the people brought the king around. From the balcony\r\nof the royal palace Ferdinand announced his readiness to take the oath to\r\nthe Constitution. The next day was spent in riotous rejoicing. The prison\r\nof the Inquisition was sacked and all political prisoners were liberated.\r\nOn the following day the mob broke into the gates and gardens of the royal\r\npalace. The members of the old municipal council entered the royal private\r\nchamber and called for a fulfilment of the king's public promise. Ferdinand\r\naccepted the inevitable under a smiling exterior, and swore an oath of\r\nfidelity to the Constitution of 1812. A provisional Junta took charge of\r\naffairs until the new Cortes should be convened.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duc de Berry assassinated]\r\n\r\nThe news of the Spanish revolution astounded Europe. In France a fanatic by\r\nthe name of Louvel deemed the moment come to strike at the reigning house\r\nof France. Louvel had followed Napoleon to exile in Elba. After the Hundred\r\nDays he dogged the footsteps of the Bourbon princes with a settled project\r\nof murder. The heir-presumptive to the French crown was the Duc de Berry.\r\nIf he died without a son the elder Bourbon line was bound to become extinct\r\nas a reigning house. On the night of February 13, Louvel attacked the Duc\r\nde Berry at the entrance of the opera house and plunged a knife into his\r\nheart. The Duchess was covered with her husband's blood. That night Duc de\r\nBerry died beseeching forgiveness for the man who had killed him. King\r\nLouis XVIII. himself closed the eyes of his nephew.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Decazes' Ministry]\r\n\r\nThe assassination of the Duc de Berry involved the ruin of the Ministry of\r\nDecazes. The ultra-royalists in their frenzy of grief and indignation\r\ncharged their chief opponent with complicity. Clausel de Coussergues, a\r\nmember of the Court of Cassation, moved the impeachment of Minister Decazes\r\nin the Chambers as an accomplice in the assassination. The King himself\r\nfelt menaced by the unwarranted accusation. \"The Royalists give me the\r\nfinishing stroke,\" said he; \"they know that the policy of M. Decazes is\r\nalso mine, and they accuse him of assassinating my nephew.\" Yet he had to\r\nabandon his favorite to the violent entreaties of the Comte d'Artois and\r\nthe Duchesse de Angoulême. Decazes was permitted to retire, and set out for\r\nLondon with his new titles of Duke and Ambassador to the Court of St.\r\nJames. Richelieu was recalled to the Ministry. The Duchesse de Berry\r\nretired to Sicily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of the Carbonari]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neapolitan military revolt]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Naples]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bourbon duplicity]\r\n\r\nIn Naples and Sicily the recent events in Spain and France exerted a\r\npowerful influence over the minds of the people. In southern Italy the\r\nsecret society of the Carbonari had become a power in the land. The members\r\nof this society, after the manner of Freemasons, took their name and the\r\nsymbolism of their rites from the calling of the charcoal burners. Since\r\nthe revolt against Bourbon tyranny in 1799, the Carbonari had played their\r\npart as revolutionary conspirators. By the year 1820 it was believed that\r\none person out of every twenty-five in Naples belonged to the society. To\r\noffset their hidden power, the government encouraged the foundation of a\r\nrival society, known as the Calderari, or Braziers. This only made matters\r\nworse. After the success of the revolution in Spain, the head lodge of the\r\nCarbonari in Salerno issued orders for a rising in June. Later the date was\r\npostponed. A score of Carbonari serving in the ranks of a cavalry regiment\r\nat Nola, persuaded one of the officers, Lieutenant Morelli, to head a\r\nrevolt in favor of a constitutional government. On July 2, Morelli marched\r\nout with a squadron of 150 men, and proclaimed for the Constitution. Only\r\none trooper refused to follow his standard. The others rode along the road\r\nto Avellino and were received with enthusiasm all along the way. The\r\ncountry was ripe for revolt. At Avellino the commandant with all his\r\ngarrison and the Bishop with the townspeople gave them a magnificent\r\nreception. The news of the revolt spread like wildfire throughout the\r\nkingdom of the Two Sicilies. Everywhere the Carbonari declared in its\r\nfavor. Before the government had taken a single step, the Constitution was\r\ngenerally proclaimed and joyfully accepted by the populace. From Naples the\r\nKing sent General Carrascosa to negotiate with the insurgents. In the\r\nmeanwhile General Pepe, himself a Carbonaro of high rank, hastened to\r\nAvellino and placed himself at the head of the revolution. On July 6, the\r\nKing published an edict promising a constitution within eight days, and\r\nthen, feigning illness, committed the royal authority to his son, the Duke\r\nof Calabria. The Carbonari, recalling the fact that the King, in order to\r\npreserve his contingent rights to the Spanish crown, had but recently\r\nhelped to sign the Spanish Constitution of 1812, insisted that this same\r\nConstitution should be proclaimed for Naples. Old King Ferdinand yielded\r\nand signed an edict to that effect. General Pepe and Morelli, at the head\r\nof the garrison of Avellino, and the national guards of Naples,\r\ntriumphantly entered the city with public honors, and were received by the\r\nDuke of Calabria, in his capacity as viceroy. On July 13, the King in\r\nperson swore to support the Constitution. Standing before the altar in the\r\nroyal chapel, he raised his eyes to the crucifix and prayed that the\r\nvengeance of God might fall upon him if ever he broke his oath. Immediately\r\nafterward he wrote to the Emperors of Austria and Russia, declaring that\r\nhis conduct on this occasion was a mere farce and that he regarded his\r\nobligations as null and void.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Portugal]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Lisbon regency]\r\n\r\nThe contagion of Spain and Sicily proved too much for the people of\r\nPortugal. The continued absence of the royal family in Brazil, and the\r\nunwelcome prolongation of the British regency had long caused\r\ndissatisfaction in Portugal. The feeling of discontent was deepened by\r\nindustrial and commercial distress which made the manifest prosperity of\r\nBrazil seem all the more galling. Marshal Beresford, the English\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Portuguese army, was generally execrated for his\r\nbarbarous treatment of military conspirators. After the outbreak of the\r\nSpanish revolution, the aspect of affairs became so threatening in Portugal\r\nthat Beresford set out for Rio Janeiro to induce the Princes of Braganza to\r\nreturn to their Court in Lisbon. Before he could accomplish his purpose,\r\nthe government that he had left behind him was overthrown by the people. On\r\nAugust 24, the city of Oporto rose against the regency. The officers of the\r\narmy, the magistrates, the priests and townspeople united in declaring\r\nagainst the regency. They established a provisional Junta to govern in the\r\nname of the King until the Cortes of Portugal could be convened to frame a\r\nconstitution. The authority of the regency in Oporto was lost without a\r\nblow. The Junta immediately seized the reins of government, and began its\r\ncareer by dismissing all English officers and paying the arrears of the\r\nsoldiers. In Lisbon the regency itself tried to stem the storm by giving\r\nits formal approval to the measures of the Junta of Oporto. The troops of\r\nLisbon, however, would no longer recognize the authority of the government.\r\nWithin a fortnight the regency was deposed, and a Junta installed in its\r\nplace. Beresford was forbidden to return to Portugal. He went to England,\r\nbut found there that the British Ministry did not deem it advisable to\r\ninterfere further in the domestic affairs of Portugal. Dom Juan VI., in Rio\r\nJaneiro, promised to return to Portugal and bestow on his subjects a\r\nliberal constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British liberalism]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sale of Russian fleet]\r\n\r\nIn England, Lord Beresford's attempt to induce the government to suppress\r\nthe revolutionists of Portugal only served to strengthen the popular\r\nantipathy that had grown up against the reactionary tendencies of the Holy\r\nAlliance. Prior to this an attempt had been made to persuade England to\r\nact as instrument of the Alliance by suppressing the rebellious colonies of\r\nSpain in South America. At the last session of the Holy Alliance, the\r\nenvoys of Russia and France submitted a paper in which they suggested that\r\nWellington, as \"the man of Europe,\" should go to Madrid to preside over a\r\nnegotiation between the Court of Spain and all the Ambassadors, regarding\r\nthe terms to be offered to the transatlantic States. If the colonies\r\ncontinued rebellious, England's fleet was counted upon to reduce them to\r\nsubmission. But the force of liberalism was too strong in England for any\r\nBritish Minister to enter into such a scheme. Then it was that the Czar of\r\nRussia sold a large part of the Russian fleet to Spain. To Englishmen, who\r\nhad seen these same ships in their harbors at the time they were held as\r\nhostages by England, this action gave but little concern. The scandal that\r\nfollowed in Spain was anticipated in England. On their arrival at Cadiz,\r\nthe Russian ships were found to be useless rotten hulks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of George III.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Caroline's trial]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of the Queen]\r\n\r\nAnother more trying scandal engrossed public attention in England. On\r\nJanuary 29, old King George III. had at last sunk into his grave. His son,\r\nGeorge IV., became king, and began his rule with the same Ministry under\r\nLord Liverpool that had served him as Prince Regent. The new king's first\r\npublic act was to call for a bill for the divorce of his wife, Caroline of\r\nBrunswick. The Cabinet refused to favor such a bill. On April 23,\r\nParliament met. The King sent \"a green bag\" to each House of Parliament,\r\ncontaining a mass of testimony and accusations concerning the queen's\r\nconduct with her Italian chamberlain, Pergami. On June 6, Queen Caroline\r\narrived from Italy. Having been refused passage on a royal ship, she\r\nchartered a vessel of her own. This bold step was taken to imply innocence.\r\nShe was received with great popular demonstrations in her favor. Before a\r\nsecret committee of Parliament, Queen Caroline offset the King's charges\r\nagainst her by laying stress on his own well-known failings as a husband.\r\nOn July 5, Lord Liverpool introduced a bill of \"Pains and Penalties\" to\r\ndissolve the marriage of Queen Caroline. Her trial was taken up by the\r\nHouse of Lords, where she was defended by Lord Brougham. To this day the\r\nproceedings of the trial are remembered as one of the most outrageous\r\nscandals in England. The feelings thereby engendered in the people have\r\nbeen immortalized in the trenchant writings of Thackeray. Before the trial\r\nwas concluded, Lord Liverpool's bill was brought up for the third time in\r\nParliament. It passed by a majority of a few votes. With so slender an\r\nindorsement, the Ministry had cause to tremble for its existence. Lord\r\nLiverpool prevailed upon the King to recede from his extreme position, and,\r\nsucceeding in this, moved for the abandonment of the bill. The trial was\r\nquashed. Queen Caroline died shortly afterward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Missouri Compromise]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cabinet in a quandary]\r\n\r\nIn America, public feeling was no less excited. The occasion for this was\r\nthe first serious clash of the Northern and Southern factions of the United\r\nStates over what was known as the Missouri Compromise. On February 18, the\r\nMissouri Compromise bill passed the Senate, and on March 2 the House. It\r\nadmitted Missouri as a slave State, and prohibited slavery north of\r\nparallel 36° 30', the southern line of Missouri. Henry Clay declared that\r\nit settled the slavery question \"forever.\" The bill went to the President.\r\nThere was still another compromise, and that was in the Cabinet. The\r\nPresident asked advice on two points. The first point was whether Congress\r\nhad a Constitutional right to prohibit slavery in a Territory. The Cabinet\r\nagreed that the right existed. Then the question arose whether the section\r\nprohibiting slavery \"forever\" referred only to the territorial condition,\r\nor whether it also applied when the Territory became a State. The Cabinet,\r\nwith the exception of Adams, agreed that \"forever\" applied only to the\r\nterritorial condition; Adams held that \"forever\" meant literally forever,\r\nin State as well as in Territory. In order to escape this dilemma it was\r\nproposed that the question of \"forever,\" as relating to States, should be\r\navoided; and that the only question should be, whether the section\r\nprohibiting slavery in the Territories forever was Constitutional. The\r\norder of proceeding was reversed; Mr. Adams was to reply in the affirmative\r\nwithout giving his reasons, while the others were to explain in writing\r\nthat the provision was Constitutional; but \"forever\" meant only while the\r\nterritorial condition existed. With this understanding the bill was signed.\r\nIt is plain now that in the unsettled point the whole pith and meaning of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise was contained, as the country learned fully and\r\ndecisively thirty-five years afterward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monroe elected President]\r\n\r\nNew issues then came to the front--protection, internal improvements, and\r\nrecognition of the South American republics. Presently, in order to\r\npreserve the balance of power between slavery and freedom, it was enacted\r\nthat Maine was to be admitted on March 15, making twelve free and twelve\r\nslave holding States. A bill was passed pronouncing the maritime slave\r\ntrade piracy. On October 20, Spain ratified the treaty ceding Florida.\r\nCongress reassembled in November. James Monroe and John Quincy Adams were\r\nthe opposing candidates for the Presidency. Monroe received 231 electoral\r\nvotes; Adams received one from a New Hampshire elector who voted in\r\nsympathy with a popular sentiment that Washington should stand alone in the\r\nhigh honor of a unanimous choice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quinine]\r\n\r\nIn this year the great fever drug quinine was first clearly separated and\r\nidentified by Drs. Pelletier and Caventou, who were spurred on to their\r\nlabors by the previous experiments with the drug by Drs. Gomez and Lambert.\r\nIn its crude form the bark of the chinchona tree had been used for its\r\nmedical properties since times immemorial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Homeopathy]\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the German physician Hahnemann's theory of\r\nhomeopathy caused general discussion among medical practitioners and\r\nlaymen. Hahnemann's first thesis was that many diseases could most quickly\r\nbe eradicated by similar effects--fever with fever, poison with\r\nanti-poison. This theory of \"like with like\"--the Greek homoia\r\nhomoiois--was accordingly named by him homeopathy. It was most fully\r\nexpressed in his \"Dogma of Rational Healing\" and in the later treatise\r\n\"Chronic Ailments and their Homeopathic Cure.\" These books created such a\r\nwidespread sensation that they were at once translated into several\r\nlanguages and ran through a great number of editions. As a matter of\r\ncourse, Hahnemann's peculiar theories were violently combated by his fellow\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hydropathy]\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time with the rise of the new science of homeopathy came\r\nVincenz Priessnitz's innovation of hydropathy or water cure. He established\r\nhis first sanitarium at Grafenberg, his birthplace, and in the face of\r\nvehement medical opposition soon won government recognition for his\r\nsanitarium. Similar water-cure establishments were erected by many\r\nimitators and followers in Germany and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convention of Troppau]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intervention in Naples]\r\n\r\nLate in the year Emperor Alexander of Russia and Metternich came together\r\nto settle on the counter strokes to be delivered against the revolutionists\r\nof Spain and southern Italy. When Metternich first heard of the fall of\r\nabsolute government in Naples he was dismayed. Gentz, who saw him at that\r\ntime, has left this record: \"Prince Metternich went to-day to inform the\r\nEmperor of the sad events in Naples. As long as I know him I have never\r\nseen him so upset by any event.\" Metternich had reason to feel alarmed. A\r\nrevolution in Naples was almost sure to be followed by an Italian uprising\r\nin the Austrian possessions of Venice and an insurrection in the Papal\r\nStates. Had Metternich felt free to follow his own devices, he would\r\nforthwith have marched an Austrian army into southern Italy to put an end\r\nto the troubles there. With all his exasperation he did not feel free to\r\ncut loose from joint action with the Czar and with the other sovereigns of\r\nEurope. Thus it came that the summer was spent in arranging for another\r\nconference of the allied monarchs. They met on October 20, at Troppau in\r\nMoravia. The Emperors of Austria and Russia and the King of Prussia\r\nreceived one another in state. The envoys of England and France were found\r\nto be in accord against armed intervention in southern Italy. The other\r\npowers determined to proceed on their course without them. Metternich's\r\ndiplomatic dealings with the Czar were greatly hampered by the clever\r\nintrigues of Count Capodistrias, Alexander's foreign minister. For once\r\nMetternich found himself matched by a diplomat even more subtle than\r\nhimself. In the end, he prevailed over Capodistrias sufficiently to\r\novercome Alexander's scruples against harsh measures in Naples. It was\r\ndetermined to invite King Ferdinand to meet the sovereigns at Leibach, in\r\nAustria, and to address a summons to the Neapolitans commanding them to\r\nabandon their constitution, under threat of immediate invasion. Accordingly\r\na note was issued from Troppau to all the courts of Europe, embodying the\r\ndoctrine of federative intervention, as applied to Naples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King Ferdinand's duplicity]\r\n\r\nAs soon as King Ferdinand received the summons he prepared to leave Naples.\r\nThe populace became aroused, and angry crowds surrounded the palace.\r\nFerdinand was not allowed to leave Naples until he had once more sworn on\r\nhis honor to maintain the constitution borrowed from Spain. The King took\r\nthis oath as readily as he did the other. Then he journeyed northward. Half\r\nway, at Leghorn, he sent letters to each of the five principal sovereigns\r\nof Europe declaring his last declaration just as null and void as his\r\nprevious perjuries. His double-dealing was rather too much even for the\r\nHoly Alliance. As Gentz, the secretary of the Congress, expressed himself\r\nin private: \"The conduct of this wretched sovereign, since the beginning of\r\nhis troubles, has been nothing but a tissue of weaknesses and lies. Happily\r\nthey will remain secret. No Cabinet will care to draw them from the\r\ngraveyard of its archives. Till then there is not much harm done.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Benjamin West]\r\n\r\nBenjamin West, the celebrated American-English artist, died at London in\r\nhis eighty-second year. At the opening of the Eighteenth Century, West was\r\nin the forefront of the agitation that grew out of his contested succession\r\nto Sir Joshua Reynolds as president of the Royal Academy. Wearied with\r\nthese quarrels he visited Paris, where he studied the newly pillaged\r\nmasterpieces at the Louvre. He resigned from the Royal Academy, but was\r\nalmost unanimously re-elected. It was then that he painted his famous\r\n\"Christ Healing the Sick.\" His later works failed to attain the success of\r\nhis earlier historical paintings. When West died, his reputation had\r\ndeclined appreciably, still a public funeral at St. Paul's Cathedral was\r\naccorded to him, a unique honor for an American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1821\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congress of Leibach]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naples under duress]\r\n\r\nThe Congress of Leibach met in January. It was attended by the\r\nrepresentatives of Russia, Austria, Prussia, England, France, Sardinia and\r\nModena. When King Ferdinand of Naples arrived he was received by the\r\nEmperors of Russia and Austria in person. It was predetermined that\r\nabsolute government in Naples should be restored by Austrian arms. The only\r\nproblem remaining to diplomacy was to put a respectable face on King\r\nFerdinand's dishonor. Capodistrias offered to make up some fictitious\r\ncorrespondence in which Ferdinand was proudly to uphold the constitution\r\nwhich he had sworn to support, and to yield protestingly to the powers only\r\nafter actual threats of war. The device was rejected as too transparent.\r\nMoreover, the old king scarcely cared how his conduct appeared to his\r\nsubjects. A letter was sent in his name to his son, the acting-viceroy,\r\nstating that the Powers were determined not to tolerate the order of things\r\nsprung from revolution, and that certain securities for peace would have to\r\nbe given. The reference to securities meant the occupation of the country\r\nby an Austrian army. The letter reached Naples on February 9. Three days\r\nbefore the Austrian troops had received their orders to cross the Po.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Rieti]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of Piedmont]\r\n\r\nThe invading army of Austria was 50,000 strong. The Neapolitan soldiers\r\nnumbered a little more than 40,000, of whom 12,000 were in Sicily engaged\r\nat Palermo in suppressing a counter revolution for home rule. At the first\r\nencounter at Rieti in the Papal territory, the Neapolitans under General\r\nPepe were utterly routed. Their forces melted away, as they did when Murat\r\nmade his last stroke for Italy and Napoleon. Not a single strong point was\r\ndefended. On March 24, the Austrians entered Naples. Then came a moment of\r\ndanger. Rebellion broke out in Piedmont, and an attempt was made to unite\r\nthe troops of Piedmont with those of Lombardy. The King of Piedmont rather\r\nthan sign the Spanish Constitution abdicated his throne. On the refusal of\r\nthe King's brother, Charles Felix, to recognize a constitution, his cousin\r\nCharles Albert of Carignano was made the regent and commander of the\r\ntroops. He advanced so cautiously that the conspirators at Milan dared not\r\nfollow suit with a revolution of their own. In the meanwhile the Czar had\r\nordered 100,000 Russians to march in the direction of the Adriatic. The\r\nAustrian forces advanced westward from the Venetian strongholds, and,\r\nbrushing aside all resistance, entered Piedmont.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Italian revolution]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Silvio Pellico]\r\n\r\nThe victory of absolutism in Italy was complete. Courts-martial sat all\r\nover Italy. Morelli, the officer who had led out the so-called sacred band\r\nof Nola, was shot. His followers were expressly excluded from all amnesty\r\nacts. An attempted insurrection in Sicily cost the conspirators their\r\nlives. Hundreds of persons were cast into prison, or were marched off to\r\ndistant fortresses in Austria. It was at this time that Silvio Pellico, the\r\nauthor of the famous \"Prison Records,\" was sent to the dungeon of\r\nSpielberg. Then began that long stream of fugitives to England and America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt in Brazil]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mexican independence]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: San Martin's Campaign]\r\n\r\nThe Holy Alliance, sitting at Leibach, thought the time was ripe to\r\npronounce its anathema against all peoples seeking their liberties\r\nelsewhere than in the grace of their legitimate sovereigns. Yet the spirit\r\nof revolt was abroad, and its flames continued to flicker up at widely\r\nseparated points. On February 26, the Portuguese troops in Brazil rose in\r\nrevolt. The king, still residing at Rio Janeiro, was compelled to appoint a\r\nnew Ministry pledged to give to both Portugal and Brazil a new\r\nrepresentative system. In Mexico, General Iturbide, at the same time,\r\nissued a pronunciamiento, containing his so-called \"Plan of Iguala,\" which\r\nproposed independence for Mexico under a Spanish Bourbon prince. Several\r\nrebel leaders acquiesced in this, and forced the Spanish viceroy to resign.\r\nJuan O'Donoju became acting-viceroy. He signed a treaty with Iturbide\r\nvirtually accepting the plan. The people of Buenos Ayres profited by the\r\nmilitary troubles in Brazil to throw in their lot with that of the\r\nArgentine Republic. Their popular idol, San Martin, meanwhile was leading\r\nhis victorious troops from Chile into Peru. Lima, one of the greatest\r\nSpanish strongholds in South America, was threatened by the revolutionists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War in Annam]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taouk-Wang]\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the earth, the new force of national feeling showed\r\nitself in popular uprisings. In distant Annam the death of Emperor\r\nGia-Long, followed by a bloody struggle for the succession between his\r\nsons, incited the people to a national demonstration against the\r\nencroachments of the French in Tonquin. In China the new Emperor Taouk-Wang\r\nwas enthroned. He was the first to throw his whole personal influence\r\nagainst the evils of the opium trade inflicted upon China by English\r\nmerchants since 1800.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philike Hetairia]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ypsilanti]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vladimiresco]\r\n\r\nIn Greece and in the Balkans the people rose against the yoke of Turkey.\r\nThe plan of the Philike Hetairia--_i.e._ Patriotic Association--was to\r\nbegin their revolution on the Danube, so as to induce Russia to take a hand\r\nin their favor. They believed that Capodistrias, the Prime Minister of\r\nRussia, himself a Greek, would win the Czar to their cause. Unfortunately\r\nfor them, Metternich's influence proved stronger than that of the Greek\r\nMinister. Capodistrias deemed it advisable to publish a pamphlet warning\r\nhis countrymen against any rash step. Failing to win the open support of\r\nCapodistrias, the Hetairists turned to Prince Alexander Ypsilanti, a Greek\r\nexile serving in the Russian army. Ypsilanti agreed to raise the standard\r\nof revolt in Moldavia. It was arranged that Theodore Vladimiresco, a\r\nRoumanian who had served in the Russian army, was to call his countrymen to\r\narms against the Turk. Then the Greeks were to step in, and the help of\r\nRussia was to be invoked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rising of Roumania]\r\n\r\nIn February, Vladimiresco proclaimed the abolition of feudal servitude in\r\nRoumania, and marched with a horde of peasants upon Bucharest. Early in\r\nMarch, the Greek troops at Galatz, let loose by their commander, Karavias,\r\nmassacred the Turkish population of that town.\r\n\r\nYpsilanti, waiting on the Russian frontier, crossed the Pruth and appeared\r\nat Jassee with a few hundred followers. A proclamation was issued, calling\r\nupon all Christians to rise against the Crescent. Ypsilanti went so far as\r\nto declare that \"a great European power,\" meaning Russia, was \"pledged to\r\nsupport him.\" The Greek Hospodar of Jassee immediately surrendered the\r\ngovernment, and supplied a large sum of money. Troops to the number of\r\n2,000 gathered around Ypsilanti. The road to the Danube lay open.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ypsilanti repudiated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Vladimiresco]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Georgakis]\r\n\r\nYpsilanti wasted valuable time loitering at Jassee. A month was lost before\r\nhe reached Bucharest. He delayed partly on account of his expectations of\r\nRussian help in response to a letter he had written to the Czar. The delay\r\nproved fatal to him. The Czar, now wholly under the influence of\r\nMetternich, sent a stern answer from Leibach. Ypsilanti was dismissed from\r\nthe Russian service. The Russian consul at Jassee issued a manifesto that\r\nRussia repudiated and condemned Ypsilanti's enterprise. The Patriarch of\r\nConstantinople was made to issue a ban of excommunication against the\r\nrebels. In an official note of the Powers, the Congress of Leibach branded\r\nthe Greek revolt as a token of the same spirit which had produced the\r\nrevolution of Italy and Spain. Turkish troops crossed the Danube. The\r\nRoumanian peasants, seeing no help from Russia, held aloof. Vladimiresco\r\nplotted against the Greeks. It was in vain that brave Georgakis captured\r\nthe traitor at his own headquarters and carried him to his death in the\r\nGreek camp. Ypsilanti was defeated in his first encounter with the Turks.\r\nHe retired before them toward the Austrian frontier. In the end he fled\r\nacross the border and was promptly made a prisoner in Austria. His\r\nfollowers dearly sold their lives. At Skuleni, 400 of them under Georgakis\r\nmade a last stand on the Pruth. They were surrounded by ten times their\r\nnumber. Georgakis refused to surrender. Bidding his followers flee, at the\r\nmoment when the Turks broke in the doors, he blew himself up in the\r\nmonastery of Skuleni.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of Morea]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gregorios hanged]\r\n\r\nAt the news of Ypsilanti's uprising in Moldavia the entire Greek population\r\nof the Morea rose against the Turk. From the outset, the Moreotes waged a\r\nwar of extermination. They massacred all Turks, men, women and children.\r\nWithin a few weeks the open country was swept clear of its Mohammedan\r\npopulation. The fugitive Turks were invested within the walls of\r\nTripolitza, Patras, and other strong towns. Sultan Mahmud took prompt\r\nvengeance. A number of innocent Greeks at Constantinople were strangled by\r\nhis executioners. The fury of the Moslem was let loose on the Infidel. All\r\nGreek settlements along the Bosphorus were burned. But the crowning stroke\r\ncame on Easter Sunday, the most sacred day of the Greek Church. The\r\nPatriarch of Constantinople, while he was celebrating service, was summoned\r\naway by the dragoman of the Porte. At the order of the Sultan he was haled\r\nbefore a hastily assembled synod and there degraded from his office as a\r\ntraitor. The synod was commanded to elect his successor. While the\r\ntrembling prelates did their bidding, Patriarch Gregorios was led out in\r\nhis sacred robes and hanged at the gate of his palace. His body remained\r\nhanging throughout the Easter celebration, and was then given to the Jews\r\nto be dragged through the streets and cast into the Bosphorus. A similar\r\nfate befell the Greek archbishops of Salonica, Tirnovo, and Adrianople. The\r\nbody of Gregorios floating in the sea was picked up by a Greek ship and\r\ncarried to Odessa. This return to Christian soil of the remains of the\r\nPatriarch was hailed as a miracle in Russia. Gregorios was solemnly buried\r\nby the Russian Government as a martyr.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia aroused]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Czar found wanting]\r\n\r\nIf the will of the Russian people had been carried out, the Russian army\r\nand nation would have avenged the murder of their high-priest by an\r\nimmediate war upon the Turks. Strogonov, the Russian Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, at once proposed to his diplomatic colleagues to join him\r\nin calling for warships to protect the Christians there. Lord Stranford,\r\nthe British Ambassador, refused to accede to this proposition.\r\nSingle-handed, Strogonov presented an ultimatum to the Sultan demanding the\r\nrestoration of Christian churches and the Porte's protection for Christian\r\nworship. A written answer was exacted within eight days. Encouraged by\r\nEngland's attitude, the Sultan ignored Strogonov's requests. On July 27,\r\nthe Russian Ambassador left Constantinople. To the amazement of his\r\nmoujiks, the Czar did not declare war. The councils of Prince Metternich\r\nprevailed. With the help of the representatives of England, Metternich\r\npersuaded the Czar to view the rebellion of Greece as a mere unfortunate\r\ndisturbance. Any countenance of it, he argued, would imperil the peace of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rising of the Greeks]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ali Pasha]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moreote campaign]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Petrobei]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kolokotrones]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maurokordatos]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Navarino]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sack of Tripolitza]\r\n\r\nThe murder of the Greek Patriarch was followed by risings of the Greeks\r\nthroughout continental Greece and the Archipelago. Here, as in the Morea,\r\nthe cause of Greek freedom was disgraced by massacres, and indignities to\r\nTurkish women. The Sultan's troops, led by able commanders, retaliated in\r\nkind. Khurshid, with a large Turkish army, besieged Janina. He held firmly\r\nto his task, even after his whole household fell into the hands of the\r\nMoreotes. The Greeks in Thessaly failed to rise, and thus the border\r\nprovinces were saved for the Ottoman Empire. The risings in remoter\r\ndistricts were soon quelled. In Epirus, Ali Pasha, the Albanian chieftain,\r\nwas surrounded by overwhelming numbers and lost his life. On the Macedonian\r\ncoast the Hetairist revolt, in which the monks of Mount Athos took part,\r\nproved abortive. Moreover, the desultory warfare on water carried on by the\r\nislanders of Hydra, Spetza, and Psara served only to annoy the Turks. The\r\nreal campaign was waged in the Morea, where Tripolitza, the seat of the\r\nTurkish Government, was besieged by the insurgents. Demetrios Ypsilanti,\r\nPrince Alexander's brother, landed on the coast and was welcomed as a\r\nleader by the peasants in arms. Three other leaders rose to prominence.\r\nFirst, in the eyes of the people, came Petrobei, chief of the family of\r\nMauromichalis. Surrounded by his nine sons, this sturdy chieftain appeared\r\nlike one of the old Homeric kings. Second in popular favor was\r\nKolokotrones, a typical modern Clepht, cunning and treacherous, but a born\r\nsoldier. The ablest political leader was Maurokordatos, a man of some\r\nbreadth of view and foresight, but over-cautious as a general. The early\r\ninsurgent successes were marred by bad faith and gross savagery. On the\r\nsurrender of Navarino, in August, a formal capitulation was signed,\r\nsafeguarding the lives of the Turkish inhabitants. In the face of this\r\ncompact the victorious Greeks put men, women and children to the sword. Two\r\nmonths later the Turkish garrison of Tripolitza, after sustaining a siege\r\nof six months, began negotiations for surrender. In the midst of the truce,\r\nthe Greek soldiery got wind of a secret bargain of their leaders to extend\r\nprotection for private gain. In defiance of the officers, the peasant\r\nsoldiers stormed Tripolitza and scaled the walls. Then followed three days\r\nof indiscriminate looting and carnage. By thousands, the Turks, with their\r\nwomen and children, were slaughtered. Kolokotrones himself records how he\r\nrode from the gateway to the citadel of Tripolitza, his horse's hoofs\r\ntouching nothing but human bodies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philhellenism]\r\n\r\nThe Greek struggle for independence aroused conflicting emotions in Europe.\r\nThe passionate sympathy of the Russians rested wholly on their religious\r\nbonds. The more enlightened Philhellenes of France and Germany affected to\r\nsee in this struggle a revival of the ancient Greek spirit that blazed\r\nforth at Thermopylæ and Marathon. For this same reason, perhaps, Metternich\r\nand his colleagues in the Holy Alliance looked upon the Greek revolution\r\nwith an evil eye. Any cause espoused by the hot-headed liberals at the\r\nuniversities in those days of itself became obnoxious to the reactionary\r\nrulers of the German and Austrian states.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Byron's Greek lyrics]\r\n\r\nThe sympathy with the Greeks was most pronounced in England. There the\r\nstirring lyrics of Lord Byron had reached the height of their popularity.\r\nHis songs of Greece and Greek freedom were justly regarded as among his\r\nbest. It was but a short time before this that the poet, to use his own\r\nphrase, had awakened one morning to find himself famous. Now his Greek\r\nsongs were hailed by the whole world as classics. Notable among them were\r\nthe \"Isles of Greece,\" embodied in the third canto of his \"Don Juan\" with\r\nthe famous stanza:\r\n\r\n  The mountains look on Marathon--\r\n    And Marathon looks on the sea;\r\n  And musing there an hour alone\r\n    I dreamed that Greece might still be free.\r\n\r\nAnd the equally celebrated lines from \"The Bride of Abydos\":\r\n\r\n  Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle\r\n    Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime?\r\n  Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle,\r\n    Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Keats]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Byron's satire]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Keats's work]\r\n\r\nIn English literary annals this year was marked furthermore by the death of\r\nJohn Keats. He was but twenty-five, still in the first flush of his genius.\r\nKeats was buried in Rome, where he died. On his gravestone is the epitaph\r\ncomposed by himself: \"Here lies one whose name was writ in water.\" It was\r\ngenerally assumed in England that the poet's death was caused by his\r\nanguish over the merciless criticisms of \"Blackwood's Magazine\" and the\r\n\"Quarterly Review.\" Lord Byron was unkind enough to exploit this notion in\r\nhis \"Don Juan\":\r\n\r\n  John Keats, who was killed off by one critique,\r\n    Just as he really promised something great\r\n  If not intelligible, without Greek\r\n    Contrived to talk about the gods of late\r\n  Much as they might have been supposed to speak.\r\n    Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;\r\n      'Tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle,\r\n      Should let itself be snuffed out by an article.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Keats died of consumption. The ravages of this disease\r\nin his case were accelerated by his feverish passion for poetry, his love\r\naffair with Fanny Brawne, financial embarrassments, and only to a slight\r\nextent by the inevitable disappointment arising from adverse criticisms.\r\nWhat Byron did for modern Greece in England, Keats may be said to have done\r\nfor ancient Greece. The beautiful songs of Greece, embodied in \"Endymion\"\r\nand \"Hyperion,\" no less than the enthusiastic odes and sonnets in praise of\r\nHellenic works of art, opened the eyes of many of the contemporaries of\r\nKeats to the enduring beauties of Greece. It was in his exquisite \"Ode to\r\na Grecian Urn,\" that Keats expressed his poetical master passion for\r\nbeauty:\r\n\r\n  Beauty is truth, truth beauty--that is all\r\n  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LORD BYRON\r\n    Painted by Maurin]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Adonais\"]\r\n\r\nShortly after Keats's death appeared one of the most beautiful of Shelley's\r\nlonger poems--\"Adonais,\" written as an elegy on the death of Keats:\r\n\r\n  I weep for Adonais--he is dead.\r\n  Oh, weep for Adonais! though our tears\r\n  Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head!\r\n  And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years\r\n  To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers,\r\n  And teach them thine own sorrow! Say. \"With me\r\n  Died Adonais; till the Future dares\r\n  Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be\r\n  An echo and a light unto eternity.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wilhelm Meister]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of romantic literature]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victor Hugo]\r\n\r\nOther literary events of the year were the publication of Goethe's \"Wilhelm\r\nMeister's Wander Jahre,\" and of Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin's first long\r\npoem, \"Ruslan and Ludmilla.\" In this epic, written during Pushkin's early\r\nbanishment to Bessarabia, an old Russian theme of the heroic times of Kiev\r\nwas treated much after the manner of Byron's romantic examples. In France\r\nthe romantic period in literature was inaugurated by young Victor Hugo,\r\nwho, but the year before, had been crowned as \"Maître des jeux floraux\" for\r\na prize poem on Henri IV. Now Chateaubriand, in his journal \"Le\r\nConservateur,\" welcomed him as \"Un enfant sublime.\" By his own romantic\r\nfollowers Hugo was hailed as chief of their poetic \"Bataillon Sacré.\"\r\nDuring the same year the poet, then barely nineteen, married Mademoiselle\r\nFoucher, a girl of fifteen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Napoleon]\r\n\r\nThe most important event of the year for Frenchmen was the death of\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte at Longwood, in St. Helena. He died on May 5, after\r\ntaking the holy sacrament. He left a last will with several codicils. In it\r\nNapoleon made the following declarations:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon's will]\r\n\r\n\"I die in the Apostolical and Roman religion, in the bosom of which I was\r\nborn more than fifty years ago. It is my wish that my ashes may repose on\r\nthe banks of the Seine, in the midst of the French people whom I have loved\r\nso well. I have always had reason to be pleased with my dearest wife, Maria\r\nLouisa. I retain for her, to the last moment, the most tender sentiments. I\r\nbeseech her to watch, in order to preserve my son from the snares which yet\r\nenviron his infancy. I recommend to my son never to forget that he was born\r\na French prince, and never to allow himself to become an instrument in the\r\nhands of the triumvirs who oppress the nations of Europe: he ought never to\r\nfight against France, or to injure her in any manner; he ought to adopt my\r\nmotto--_Everything for the French people_. I die prematurely, assassinated\r\nby the English oligarchy and its tool. The English nation will not be slow\r\nin avenging me. The two unfortunate results of the invasions of France,\r\nwhen she had still so many resources, are to be attributed to the treason\r\nof Marmont, Augereau, Talleyrand, and Lafayette. I forgive them--may the\r\nposterity of France forgive them as I do! I pardon Louis for the libel he\r\npublished in 1820; it is replete with false assertions and falsified\r\ndocuments. I disavow the 'Manuscript of St. Helena,' and other works, under\r\nthe title of 'Maxims, Sayings,' etc., which persons have been pleased to\r\npublish for the last six years. Such are not the rules which have guided my\r\nlife. I caused the Duc d'Enghien to be arrested and tried because that step\r\nwas essential to the safety, interest and honor of the French people, when\r\nthe Comte d'Artois was maintaining, by his own confession, sixty assassins\r\nat Paris. Under similar circumstances I should act in the same way.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bequests]\r\n\r\nTo his son and immediate relatives, Napoleon left most of his personal\r\neffects. Among his relatives and favorite followers he distributed a sum of\r\n6,000,000 francs, left in the hands of his bankers at the time of his\r\nflight from Paris; likewise the proceeds of a possible sale of his\r\nconfiscated crown jewels. Count Lavalette and the children of Labédoyère\r\nwere remembered with bequests of 100,000 and 50,000 francs, respectively.\r\nThe final clauses were:\r\n\r\n\"To be distributed among such proscribed persons as wander in foreign\r\ncountries, whether they be French, Italians, Belgians, Dutch, Spanish, or\r\ninhabitants of the departments of the Rhine, under the directions of my\r\nexecutors, one hundred thousand francs. To be distributed among those who\r\nsuffered amputation, or were severely wounded at Ligny or Waterloo, who may\r\nbe still living, according to lists drawn up by my executors. The Guards\r\nshall be paid double, those of the Island of Elba quadruple, two hundred\r\nthousand francs.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cantillon remembered]\r\n\r\nA curious bequest was that of 10,000 francs to Cantillon, a French\r\nsubaltern, who was tried and acquitted for the attempted assassination of\r\nthe Duke of Wellington in Paris on February 11, 1818. Napoleon thus\r\nexplained this bequest:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Last fling at Wellington]\r\n\r\n\"Cantillon had as much right to assassinate that oligarchist as the latter\r\nhad to send me to perish upon the rock of St. Helena. Wellington, who\r\nproposed this outrage, attempted to justify it by pleading the interest of\r\nGreat Britain. Cantillon, if he had really assassinated that lord, would\r\nhave pleaded the same excuse, and been justified by the same motive--the\r\ninterest of France--to get rid of this general, who, moreover, by violating\r\nthe capitulation of Paris, had rendered himself responsible for the blood\r\nof the martyrs Ney, Labédoyère, etc., and for the crime of having pillaged\r\nthe museums, contrary to the text of the treaties.\"\r\n\r\nThis last legacy was not paid until 1855, when Napoleon III. discharged it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Richelieu's Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Villèle Prime Minister]\r\n\r\nLate in the year the Ministry of Duc de Richelieu succumbed to the\r\nmachinations of Comte d'Artois. Before his resignation, Richelieu\r\ncomplained to the Count, reminding him of his promises of support at the\r\nfirst formation of the Cabinet. \"The fact is, my dear Duke,\" replied\r\nMonsieur, \"if you allow me to say so, you have taken my words too\r\nliterally. And then the circumstances at that time were so different.\" The\r\nPrime Minister rose abruptly and sought out the King. \"Monsieur has broken\r\nhis word of honor,\" he said, \"he has broken his word as a gentleman.\" \"What\r\nwould you have me do?\" said Louis XVIII. \"He conspired against Louis XVI.;\r\nhe conspires against me; he will conspire against himself.\" The explosion\r\nof a barrel of gunpowder in the royal palace raised apprehensions of\r\nanother painful scene, like that preceding the fall of the Ministry of\r\nDecazes. Richelieu resigned, and Villèle took his place. Chateaubriand was\r\nsent to London as Ambassador. While Parliamentary government in France\r\nlabored thus under the onslaughts of the Royalist plotters in the Chambers,\r\nthe so-called Era of Good Feeling in America was continued under the second\r\nadministration of President Monroe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inauguration of Monroe]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Missouri admitted to Statehood]\r\n\r\nThe 4th of March fell on a Sunday, and Monroe was the first President to be\r\ninaugurated on the 5th. Missouri was admitted conditionally, and, on August\r\n10, the President proclaimed its admission as the twenty-fourth State amid\r\na tempest of political excitement. The contest over the slavery question\r\nwas now supposed to be forever settled. In the debates of 1821, the House\r\nstood firmly against Missouri's admission as a slave State, and the Senate\r\nwas equally determined that the colored citizens of other States should be\r\ndenied citizenship in Missouri if the people so desired. At last it came to\r\na conference committee. It was decided that the State should be admitted,\r\nas soon as its Legislature would agree that the section of the Constitution\r\nin question should not be construed as authorizing a law excluding any\r\ncitizens of other States from the immunities and privileges to which they\r\nwere entitled under the Constitution. The Legislature of Missouri gave this\r\npledge, but it remained open whether free negroes and mulattoes were\r\ncitizens in other States, and whether they were to be made citizens in\r\nMissouri. In the admission of Missouri there was for the first time an\r\nunmixed issue on the question of a free government or a slave-holding\r\ngovernment in the United States. Doubtful dealings on the part of the\r\nSenators from Indiana and Illinois were followed by an attempt to make\r\nthese States both slave-holding States, in face of the binding law of the\r\nOrdinance of 1787. A popular movement led by Governor Edward Coles of\r\nIllinois defeated this project.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liberia]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Junius Brutus Booth]\r\n\r\nOn May 5, the territory of Liberia was secured on the west coast of Africa,\r\nand a colony was founded for the repatriation of negro slaves, with\r\nMonrovia for a capital. During this same period Junius Brutus Booth made\r\nhis first appearance in America, as Richard III., at Richmond. Late in the\r\nyear the remains of André, the British officer who was shot as a spy during\r\nthe American Revolution, were placed on a British ship for interment in\r\nWestminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1822\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greek independence declared]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sack of Chios]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kanaris' exploit]\r\n\r\nGreek independence was declared on January 27. After the fall of Ali Pasha\r\nin February, the Sultan was able to turn his undivided attention to the\r\nGreek revolt. In March, a body of Samian revolutionists landed in Chios and\r\nincited the islanders to rise against the Turk. They laid siege to the\r\ncitadel held by a Turkish garrison. Had the fleet of the Hydriotes helped\r\nthem, they might have prevailed. As it was they rendered themselves a prey\r\nto the Turkish troops on the mainland. An army of nearly 10,000 Turks\r\nlanded in Chios, and relieved the besieged garrison. Then the fanatical\r\nMoslems were let loose on the gentle inhabitants of the little island.\r\nThousands were put to the sword. The slave markets of Northern Africa were\r\nglutted with Chian women and children. Within a month the once lovely\r\nisland was a ruined waste. All Greece and Europe was filled with horror.\r\nMaurokordatos, now at the head of Greek affairs, was bitterly blamed for\r\nnot sending over a fleet to save Chios. One single Greek took it into his\r\nhands to avenge his countrymen. The Turks were celebrating their sacred\r\nmonth of Ramazan. On the night of June 18, the festival of Biram, the\r\nTurkish fleet, under command of Kara Ali, was illuminated with colored\r\nlanterns. On that night Constantine Kanaris, a sea-captain from Psara,\r\ndrove a fire-ship into the midst of the Turkish fleet. Sailing close up to\r\nthe admiral's flagship he thrust his bowsprit into one of the portholes.\r\nThen setting fire to the pitch and resin on board his ship, he dropped into\r\nhis small boat and pulled away. A breeze fanned the flames, and in a moment\r\nthe big Turkish man-of-war was afire. The powder magazine blew up and the\r\nlifeboats went up in flames. The burning rigging fell down upon the doomed\r\ncrew, and the admiral was struck down on his poop-deck. The ship was burned\r\nto the water's edge. The Turkish fleet scattered before the shower of\r\nblazing sparks, and was only brought together under the guns of the\r\nDardanelles. This exploit made Kanaris the hero of Greece. Within the same\r\nyear he repeated the feat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morea reinvaded]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Philhellene corps]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defence of Argos]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turks demoralized]\r\n\r\nThe Sultan had thrown his whole land force into the Greek mainland.\r\nKhurshid, after his defeat of Ali Pasha, marched to Larissa, in Thessaly.\r\nThence two armies, 50,000 strong, under Bramali and Homer Brionis converged\r\nupon the Morea. In the face of so formidable an invasion, Maurokordatos\r\ntook the field himself. He mismanaged things badly. At Arta he sacrificed\r\nhis choicest regiment, the famous corps of Philhellenes, composed of\r\nforeign officers and commanded by men who had won distinction in Napoleon's\r\ncampaigns. They were cut down almost to a man. Maurokordatos fell back to\r\nMissolonghi. In the meanwhile Dramalis with 25,000 foot and 6,000 horse\r\npenetrated into the Morea. The Greek Government at Argos dispersed. All\r\nwould have been lost for the Greeks had Dramalis not neglected to cover the\r\nmountain passes behind him. While he marched on to Nauplia, the Greek\r\nmountaineers rose behind him. Demetrios Ypsilanti, the acting-president of\r\nGreece, with a few hundred followers threw himself into Argos. There he\r\nheld the Acropolis against the Turkish rearguard. Kolokotrones, calling out\r\nthe last men from Tripolitza, relieved Ypsilanti at Argos. The mountain\r\npassage was seized. Dramalis had to give up his conquest of the Morea, and\r\nfight his way back to the Isthmus of Corinth. Without supplies and harassed\r\nby hostile peasant forces the Turkish army became badly demoralized.\r\nThousands were lost on the way. Dramalis himself died from over-exposure.\r\nThe remainder of his army melted away at Corinth under the combined effects\r\nof sickness and drought.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capodistrias resigns]\r\n\r\nA decisive turn in the Greek war for independence was reached. Europe\r\nrealized that the revolt had grown to the proportions of a national war.\r\nPopular sympathy in Russia became more clamorous. Capodistrias, the Russian\r\nPrime Minister, rightly measured the force of this long pent-up feeling.\r\nUnable to move the Czar, who still floundered in the toils of the Holy\r\nAlliance, Capodistrias withdrew from public affairs and retired to Geneva.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suicide of Castlereagh]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canning]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iturbide Emperor of Mexico]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Pichincha]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: San Martin retires]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Junin]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ayacucho]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Independence of Brazil]\r\n\r\nIn England, the suicide of Castlereagh brought Canning once more into\r\nprominence. Robert Peel was made Home Secretary. Canning's long retirement\r\nafter the fiasco of his American policy, and his breach with Castlereagh,\r\nhad served to chasten this statesman. As leader of the opposition, he had\r\nlearned to reckon with the forces of popular feeling. When he returned to\r\npower in 1822, he was no longer an ultra-conservative, but a liberal. He\r\nnow made no disguise of his sympathies with the cause of Greece, and with\r\nthe struggle for independence in South and Central America. There the\r\ncourse of freedom had gathered so much momentum that it was plain to all\r\nthat Spain could never prevail without help from others. In Mexico, upon\r\nthe refusal of Ferdinand VII. to accept the separate crown of Mexico,\r\nGeneral Iturbide proclaimed himself emperor. On May 19, he assumed the\r\ndignity. As Augustine I., he was crowned in the Cathedral of Mexico in\r\nJuly. At the same time San Martin and Bolivar met at Guayaquil to dispose\r\nof the destinies of South America. San Martin had just succeeded in\r\nliberating Peru, and had made his triumphal entry into Lima. Bolivar had\r\nbrought aid to Ecuador, and established independence there. José de Sucre,\r\nwhom Bolivar called the \"soul of his army,\" defeated the Spaniards in the\r\nfamous battle of Pichincha, fought at a height of 10,200 feet above the\r\nsea. When Bolivar and San Martin met on July 25, San Martin announced his\r\ndetermination to give a free field to Bolivar. The two men parted at a\r\ngreat public love-feast at which San Martin toasted Bolivar as the\r\n\"liberator of Colombia.\" In his farewell address he said: \"The presence of\r\na fortunate general in the country which he has conquered is detrimental to\r\nthe state. I have won the independence of Peru, and I now cease to be a\r\npublic man.\" Speaking privately of Bolivar, he said: \"He is the most\r\nextraordinary character of South America; one to whom difficulties but add\r\nstrength.\" With his daughter Mercedes, San Martin retired to Europe, to\r\ndwell there in obscurity and poverty. Bolivar, with Generals Sucre, Miller\r\nand Cordova, assembled a great liberating army at Juarez. After a\r\npreliminary victory at Junin, Bolivar returned to Lima to assume the reigns\r\nof government, while his generals pushed on against the forces of the\r\nSpanish viceroy. Late in the year a decisive battle was fought at Ayacucho.\r\nThe revolutionists charged down the mountain ridges upon the Spaniards in\r\nthe plain, and utterly routed them. The viceroy himself was wounded, with\r\n700 of his men, while 1,400 Spaniards were killed outright. In these\r\ncasualties the unusual disparity between killed and wounded reveals the\r\nunsparing ferocity of the fight. In Brazil a peaceful revolution was\r\neffected in September. After the return of Juan VI. to Portugal his son Dom\r\nPedro reigned as regent. On September 7, he yielded to the demands of his\r\nAmerican subjects, and proclaimed the independence of Brazil. He was\r\ndeclared constitutional emperor of Brazil on October 12, and was crowned as\r\nsuch shortly afterward at Rio Janeiro.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discontent in Spain]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign aid invoked]\r\n\r\nThe South American colonies had now in great part secured independence.\r\nSpain was thereby robbed of her best resources. As financial distress\r\nbecame more widespread, the spirit of discontent rose. The King's plottings\r\nwith the extreme Royalists of France lost him the confidence of his\r\nsubjects. In the south the triumphant party of the so-called Exaltados\r\nrefused obedience to the central administration. The municipal governments\r\nof Cadiz, Cartagena and Seville took the tone of independent republics. In\r\nthe north, the Serviles, instigated by French agitators and their money,\r\nbroke into open rebellion. After the adjournment of the Cortes, Ferdinand\r\nattempted to make a stroke for himself. The Royal Guards were ordered to\r\nmarch from Aranjuez to Madrid to place themselves under the King's personal\r\ncommand. The people took alarm, and several regiments of disaffected\r\nsoldiers were induced to head off the guards. A fight ensued in the streets\r\nof Madrid. The guards were scattered. The King found himself a prisoner in\r\nhis own palace. He wrote to Louis XVIII. that his crown was in peril. The\r\nBourbon sympathizers in the north at once seized the town of Seo d'Urgel,\r\nand set up a provisional government. Civil war spread over Spain.\r\nNapoleon's final prophecy that Bourbon rule would end in the ruin of Spain,\r\nand the loss of all the best colonies was near fulfilment. It was then that\r\nthe Continental powers of Europe proposed to interfere on behalf of the\r\nSpanish monarchy. The death of old Minister Hardenberg in Berlin did not\r\nloosen Metternich's hold on Prussia. Emperor Alexander hoped to conciliate\r\nhis army, burning to fall upon the Turk, by treating them to a light\r\ncampaign in Spain. In France, the Spanish war party likewise had the upper\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monroe Doctrine]\r\n\r\nNothing could save Spain; but Spanish South and Central America presented\r\nanother issue. The new republics had developed a thriving trade with Great\r\nBritain and the United States of America, which made it impossible for\r\nthese countries to ignore their flags. In America, Henry Clay on the floor\r\nof Congress, had already urged the recognition of South American\r\nindependence. In his annual message to Congress in 1822 President Monroe\r\ntook up the question. On behalf of the United States he declared that, the\r\nAmerican continents were henceforth not to be considered a subject for\r\nfurther colonization by any European power. \"In the war between Spain and\r\nher colonies,\" said President Monroe, \"the United States will continue to\r\nobserve the strictest neutrality.... With the existing colonies or\r\ndependencies of any European power we have not interfered and shall not\r\ninterfere. But with the governments who have declared their independence\r\nand maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great considerations\r\nand on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view any interposition\r\nfor the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner\r\ntheir destiny by any European power, in any other light than as the\r\nmanifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jefferson's indorsement]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canning's part]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fyffe's comment]\r\n\r\nIt was the famous Monroe Doctrine, a doctrine that in its substance, if not\r\nin words, had already served as the guiding star of Thomas Jefferson's and\r\nMadison's foreign policy. It is related that President Monroe, applying to\r\nThomas Jefferson for his opinion on the matter, was surprised at the\r\npositive nature of the reply which he received. \"Our first and fundamental\r\nmaxim,\" said Jefferson, \"should be never to entangle ourselves in the\r\nbroils of Europe; our second, never to suffer Europe to intermeddle with\r\ncis-Atlantic affairs.\" At the same time that America thus flung down her\r\ngauntlet to Europe, Canning, on behalf of the British Ministry, proposed to\r\ninform the allied Cabinets of England's intention to accredit envoys to the\r\nSouth American republics. Assured of the support of the United States, and\r\nof Great Britain as well, South America could feel free to work out her own\r\ndestiny. This was the master-stroke of Canning's career. When brought to\r\nbay afterward in Parliament, he could proudly boast: \"I called the New\r\nWorld into being, in order to redress the balance of the Old.\" To Americans\r\nCanning's boast has ever seemed to rest on a flimsy foundation. As Fyffe,\r\nthe English historian of modern Europe, has justly said, \"The boast, famous\r\nin our Parliamentary history, has left an erroneous impression of the part\r\nreally played by Canning at this crisis. He did not call the New World into\r\nexistence; he did not even assist it in winning independence, as France had\r\nassisted the United States fifty years before; but when this independence\r\nhad been won, he threw over it the ægis of Great Britain, declaring that no\r\nother European power should reimpose the yoke which Spain had not been able\r\nto maintain.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Shelley]\r\n\r\nAt the time that Canning made British liberalism respected abroad, literary\r\nEngland suffered another irreparable loss by the death of Percy Bysshe\r\nShelley. The last few weeks had been spent by Shelley in Italy in the\r\ncompany of Trelawney, Williams and Lord Byron. Before this Maurokordatos,\r\nnow battling in Greece, had been their constant companion. In June Leigh\r\nHunt arrived. Shelley and Williams set out in a boat to meet him at\r\nLeghorn. The long parted friends met there. On July 8, Shelley and Williams\r\nset sail for the return voyage to Lerici. Their boat was last seen ten\r\nmiles out at sea off Reggio. Then the haze of a summer storm hid it from\r\nview. Ten days later Shelley's body was washed ashore near Reggio. It was\r\nidentified by a volume of Sophocles and of Keats's poems found on his\r\nperson. In the presence of Byron, Trelawney and Leigh Hunt, Shelley's\r\nremains were cremated on the shore. His ashes were buried in the same\r\nburial ground with Keats, hard by the pyramid of Caius Cestius in Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lyric quality of his work]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shelley's career]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shelley's threnody]\r\n\r\nShelley's poetry belongs primarily to the Revolutionary epoch in modern\r\nhistory. Though he wrote several long narrative poems and one great\r\ntragedy, he was above all a lyric poet--according to some the greatest\r\nlyric poet of England. His life, like his poetry, was almost untrammelled\r\nby convention. Both gave great offence to the stricter elements of English\r\nsociety. In some respects Shelley was peculiarly unfortunate. At the age of\r\neighteen, after his expulsion from Oxford University, he married Harriet\r\nWestbrook, a girl of sixteen, and then found himself unable to support\r\nher. Later he abandoned her and eloped with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin.\r\nWithin a year his first wife committed suicide, and, three weeks later,\r\nShelley married Mary Godwin. The tragedy stirred up much feeling among his\r\nfriends. Among others the poet-laureate, Southey, remonstrated with\r\nShelley. Shelley replied: \"I take God to witness, if such a Being is now\r\nregarding both you and me, and I pledge myself, if we meet, as perhaps you\r\nexpect, before Him after death, to repeat the same in His presence--that\r\nyou accuse me wrongfully. I am innocent of ill, either done or intended.\"\r\nNext came Shelley's trouble with the Chancery. Lord-Chancellor Elden\r\nrefused to give to Shelley the custody of his own children on the ground\r\nthat Shelley's professed opinions and conduct were such as the law\r\npronounced immoral. Shelley replied with his famous poetical curse \"To the\r\nLord Chancellor.\" While the poem stands as a masterpiece of lyric invective\r\nit did not mend matters for Shelley in England. In many of his other poems\r\nhis detractors saw nothing but the glorification of revolution, incest, and\r\natheism. When he wrote a satirical drama on so delicate a subject as the\r\nunhappy affairs of Queen Caroline, even his publisher turned against him.\r\nYet the charm and beauty of Shelley's purely lyric pieces was such that he\r\nmust ever stand as one of the foremost poets of England. Either his\r\n\"Adonais\" or the beautiful \"Ode to the West Wind,\" would alone have\r\nperpetuated his name in English letters. One of Shelley's most exquisite\r\npieces, written shortly before his death, has come to stand as the poet's\r\nown threnody:\r\n\r\n  \"When the lamp is shattered\r\n    The light in the dust lies dead--\r\n  When the cloud is scattered\r\n    The rainbow's glory is shed.\r\n  When the lute is broken,\r\n    Sweet tones are remembered not;\r\n  When the lips have spoken,\r\n    Loved accents are soon forgot.\r\n\r\n  As music and splendor\r\n    Survive not the lamp and the lute,\r\n  The heart's echoes render\r\n    No song when the spirit is mute,\r\n  No song but sad dirges,\r\n    Like the wind through a ruined cell,\r\n  Or the mournful surges\r\n    That ring the dead seaman's knell.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revival of letters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Golden age of music]\r\n\r\nDuring this same year Thomas de Quincey published his \"Confessions of an\r\nOpium Eater,\" a masterpiece of balanced prose. In other parts of the world,\r\nlikewise, it was a golden period for literature. In France, Victor Hugo\r\npublished his \"Odes et Poésies Diverses,\" a collection of early poems which\r\ncontained some of his most charming pieces. The rising Swedish poet,\r\nTegnér, brought out his \"Children of the Last Supper.\" In Germany, Heinrich\r\nHeine, then still a student at Bonn, issued his earliest verses. For\r\nGermany this was no less a golden age of music. Beethoven, though quite\r\ndeaf, was still the greatest of living composers. His great Choral\r\nSymphony, the ninth in D minor, was produced during this year, as was his\r\nSolemn Mass in D major. As a virtuoso he was rivalled by Hummel, who at\r\nthis time gave to the world his famous Septet, accepted by himself as his\r\nmasterwork. Two other German composers so distinguished themselves that\r\nthey were invited to London to conduct the Philharmonic accompaniments.\r\nThey were Carl Maria von Weber, who had just brought out his brilliant\r\nopera, \"Der Freischütz,\" and Ludwig Spohr, who performed in London his new\r\nSymphony in D minor. Of other composers there were Franz Schubert, whose\r\nmelodious songs and symphonies won him the recognition of the Esterhazys\r\nand of Beethoven. Among those whose career was but beginning were Jacob\r\nMeyerbeer, a fellow pupil with Weber under Abbé Vogler at Vienna, and Felix\r\nMendelssohn, the precocious pupil of the famous pianist Moscheles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Herschel]\r\n\r\nSir Frederick William Herschel, the greatest modern astronomer, died at\r\nSlough in England. Herschel was born in 1738 at Hanover. He was a musician\r\nof rare skill and a self-taught mathematician of great ability. In 1757, he\r\ndeserted the band of Hanoverian Guards in which he played the oboe,\r\nalthough a mere boy, and fled to England, where he taught music and\r\nachieved success as a violinist and organist. His studies in sound and\r\nharmony led him to take up optics; and from optics to astronomy the step\r\nwas short. Dissatisfied with the crude instruments of his time, he made his\r\nown telescopes; for it was his ambition to be not a mere star-gazer, but an\r\nearnest student of the heavens. By day, he and his brother and sister\r\nground specula; by night he observed the heavens. His astronomical work\r\nincludes a careful study of variable stars; an attempt to explain the\r\nrelation of sun-spots to terrestrial phenomenæ; the determination that the\r\nperiods of rotation of various satellites, like the rotation of our own\r\nmoon, are equal to the times of their revolutions about their primaries;\r\nand the discovery of the planet Uranus and two of its satellites, and of\r\nthe sixth and seventh satellites of Saturn. His greatest work was his study\r\nof binary stars and the demonstration of his belief that the law of\r\ngravitation is universal in its application. His labors were invariably\r\nsystematic, and were characterized by dogged, Teutonic perseverance. His\r\ndiscoveries were never purely accidental, but were made in accordance with\r\na well-conceived plan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Canova]\r\n\r\nLate in the autumn news came from Venice that Canova, the celebrated\r\nsculptor, had died. Antonio Canova was born in 1757 at Passaguo near\r\nTreviso. He was first an apprentice to a statuary in Bassano, from whom he\r\nwent to the Academy of Venice, where he had a brilliant career. In 1779 he\r\nwas sent by the Senate of Venice to Rome, and there produced his Theseus\r\nand the Slain Minotaur. In 1783, Canova undertook the execution of the tomb\r\nof Pope Clement XIV., a work similar to the tomb of Pope Clement XIII. His\r\nfame rapidly increased. He established a school for the benefit of young\r\nVenetians, and among other works produced the well-known Hebe and the\r\ncolossal Hercules hurling Lichas into the sea. In 1797, Canova finished the\r\nmodel of the celebrated tomb of the Archduchess Christina of Austria.\r\nNapoleon called the rising sculptor to France, and he there executed the\r\nfamous nude portrait of Napoleon now preserved in Milan. After his return\r\nto Italy he fashioned his Perseus with the Head of Medusa at Rome. When the\r\nBelvidere Apollo was carried off to France, this piece of statuary was\r\nthought not unworthy of the classic Apollo's place and pedestal in the\r\nVatican. Among the later works of Canova are the colossal group of Theseus\r\nKilling the Minotaur, a Paris, and a Hector. After Napoleon's second fall\r\nin 1815, Canova was commissioned by the Pope to demand the restoration of\r\nthe works of art carried from Rome. He went to Paris and succeeded in his\r\nmission. At his return to Rome in 1816, the Pope created him Marquis of\r\nOrchia, with a pension of 3,000 scudi, and his name was entered into the\r\nGolden Book at the Capitol. His closing years were spent in Venice. There\r\nhe died October 13, 1822.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congress of Verona]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: England slighted]\r\n\r\nUpon Canning's accession to the Ministry in England, Wellington was\r\nappointed representative of Great Britain at the Congress of Powers\r\nconvened at Vienna. The unsettled state of public opinion kept Wellington\r\nin England and later at Paris. He did not join the Congress until after its\r\nadjournment to Verona, to dispose of purely Italian affairs. Thus it\r\nhappened that the supplementary meetings at Verona became the real European\r\nCongress of 1822. With the Neapolitan problem practically settled, and the\r\nGreek war with Turkey at a standstill, the situation in Spain was the most\r\nvital issue. The Czar of Russia and Metternich were determined not to\r\ntolerate the Constitution of the Spanish liberals. Alexander hoped to make\r\ngood Russia's non-intervention in Greece by marching a victorious army into\r\nSpain. The extreme Royalists of France, on the other hand, were so bent on\r\naccomplishing this task themselves that they were resolved not to permit\r\nany Russian troops to pass through France. With the spectre of a general\r\nEuropean war thus looming on the horizon, England endeavored to hold the\r\nbalance for peace. Acting under the instructions of Canning, Wellington\r\ndeclared that England would rather set herself against the great alliance\r\nthan consent to joint intervention in Spain. In his despatches to Canning,\r\nWellington expressed his belief that this would result in a decision to\r\nleave the Spaniards to themselves. The only result was that England was\r\nleft out of the affair altogether, as she had been in the case of Naples.\r\nIt was partly owing to this international slight that Canning put his foot\r\ndown so firmly in behalf of Portugal and the South American colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French attitude toward Spain]\r\n\r\nAt the Congress of Verona, Metternich once more won the day. With this\r\nbacking, the French envoys, Montmorency and Chateaubriand, in defiance of\r\ntheir home instructions, committed France to war with Spain. An agreement\r\nwas reached that, in default of radical changes in the Spanish\r\nConstitution, France and her allies would resort to intervention. On the\r\npart of England, Wellington rejected this proposal, but all the other\r\npowers consented. When the French Ambassadors returned to France, their\r\nPrime Minister, Villèle, vented his dissatisfaction by repudiating his\r\nenvoys. He addressed himself to the foreign Ambassadors at Paris with a\r\nrequest that the allies' demands on Spain be postponed. Montmorency at once\r\nresigned. No notice was taken of Villèle's request except by England. The\r\nKing himself went over to the war party and appointed Chateaubriand his\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs. Great Britain's tentative offer of mediation\r\nwas summarily rejected by France. To Villèle, King Louis XVIII. thus\r\nexplained his attitude: \"Louis XIV. destroyed the Pyrenees; I shall not\r\nallow them to be raised again. He placed my house on the throne of Spain; I\r\nshall not allow it to fall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1823\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French invasion of Spain]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government was resolved to maintain the national independence\r\nof Spain. It would make no concession. The French Ambassador in Madrid was\r\nrecalled. At the opening of the French Chambers in January, the King\r\nhimself announced his decision: \"I have ordered the recall of my Minister.\r\nOne hundred thousand Frenchmen, commanded by a prince of my family, whom I\r\nfondly call my son, are ready to march with a prayer to the God of St.\r\nLouis that they may preserve the throne of Spain to the grandson of Henri\r\nIV. They shall save that fair kingdom from ruin and reconcile it to\r\nEurope.\" By the middle of March, the Duke of Angoulême and his staff left\r\nParis. On April 7, the French vanguard crossed the Bidassoa, and the Duke\r\nentered Irun, welcomed by Spanish royalists. About the same time the Cortes\r\nand Constitutional Ministry left Madrid, and compelled King Ferdinand VII.\r\nto accompany them to Seville. The forces of the Spanish Government fell\r\nback without striking a blow. Bands of freebooters calling themselves\r\nroyalists went pillaging throughout the northern provinces. The commandant\r\nof Madrid felt constrained to beg the French to hasten their advance lest\r\nthe city fall a prey to the freebooters. Already the looting of the suburbs\r\nhad begun, when the French entered the Spanish capital on the 24th of May.\r\nA regency was appointed under the Duke of Infantado. The Continental powers\r\nsent accredited representatives to Madrid. Meanwhile the Cortes withdrew to\r\nCadiz. King Ferdinand refused to accompany them; so they suspended his\r\npowers and appointed a regency over his head. The French prepared to lay\r\nsiege to Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Portugal]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Independence of Central America]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The South American struggle]\r\n\r\nCivil war broke out in Spain. Across the border in Portugal, Dom Miguel,\r\nthe second son of the absent king, excited a counter revolution. This state\r\nof affairs in the Peninsula gave a finishing stroke to the royal cause in\r\nAmerica. In Central America, the revolutionists of Costa Rica and\r\nGuatemala, who had made common cause with Mexico, proclaimed their\r\nindependence. In Mexico, Santa Anna proclaimed the republic at Vera Cruz.\r\nEmperor Iturbide, who felt his throne tottering beneath him, retired, and\r\nwas banished from Mexico with an annuity. His sympathizers in Costa Rica\r\nwere overthrown in a battle at Ochomoco. On the first day of July, Costa\r\nRica was united with its neighboring States in the federation of Central\r\nAmerica. Nor had Peru been idle. Two royalist armies under Santa Cruz had\r\nentered the upper provinces. During the summer months they overran the\r\ncountry between La Paz and Oruro. But in early autumn they were forced back\r\nby the revolutionists under Bolivar, who entered Lima on September 1, and\r\nhad himself proclaimed dictator of Peru. In Brazil, during this interval,\r\nthe Constitutional Assembly had been convoked in accordance with Dom\r\nPedro's promise. Under the leadership of the two Andrade brothers the\r\ndelegates insisted on the most liberal of constitutions. Dom Pedro's first\r\nattempt to suppress the liberal leaders was foiled by the Assembly. Finally\r\nhe dissolved the contentious assembly and exiled the Andrade brothers to\r\nFrance. In the provinces of Pernambuco and Ceara a republic was proclaimed.\r\nRebellion broke out in Cisplatina.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Warring factions in Spain]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Cadiz]\r\n\r\nIn Spain, the two opposing regencies vied with each other in retaliatory\r\nmeasures. Odious persecutions were instituted on both sides. In vain the\r\nDuke of Angoulême tried to restrain the reprisals of the Spanish royalists.\r\nIn August he appeared before Cadiz. He called upon King Ferdinand to\r\npublish an amnesty and restore the medieval Cortes. But the Spanish\r\nMinistry, in the King's name, sent a defiant answer. Cadiz was thereupon\r\nbesieged. On August 30, the French stormed the fort of the Trocadero. Three\r\nweeks later the city was bombarded. For the Spanish liberals, the cause had\r\nbecome hopeless. The French refused all terms but the absolute liberation\r\nof the King. On Ferdinand's assurance that he bore no grudge against his\r\ncaptors, the liberals agreed to release him. At last, on the 30th of\r\nSeptember, Ferdinand signed a proclamation of absolute and universal\r\namnesty. Next day he was taken across the bay to the French headquarters.\r\nThe Cortes dissolved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Release of Ferdinand VII.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Angoulême received King Ferdinand with misgivings. Already he\r\nhad written to France: \"What most worries the liberals is the question of\r\nguarantees. They know that the King's word is utterly worthless, and that\r\nin spite of his promises he may very well hang every one of them.\"\r\nAngoulême's first interview confirmed his impression. In reply to his\r\ndemand for a general pardon, Ferdinand pointed to the ragged mob shouting\r\nin front of his windows, and said: \"You hear the will of the people.\"\r\nAngoulême wrote to Villèle: \"This country is about to fall back into\r\nabsolutism. I have conscientiously done my part, and shall only express my\r\nsettled conviction that every foolish act that can be done will be done.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royalist reprisals]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Riego executed]\r\n\r\nWithin twelve hours Ferdinand annulled all acts of the Constitutional\r\nGovernment during the preceding three years. By approving an act of the\r\nregency of Madrid, which declared all those who had taken part in the\r\nremoval of the King to be traitors, Ferdinand practically signed the death\r\nwarrant of those men whom he had just left with fair promises on his lips.\r\nEven before reaching Madrid, Ferdinand VII. banished for life from Madrid\r\nand from the country fifty miles around it every person who had served the\r\ngovernment in Spain during the last three years. Don Saez, the King's\r\nconfessor, was made Secretary of State. He revived the Inquisition, and\r\nordered the prosecution of all those concerned in the pernicious and\r\nheretical doctrines associated with the late outbreak. Ferdinand justified\r\nhis acts with a royal pronunciamiento containing this characteristic\r\npassage: \"My soul is confounded with the horrible spectacle of the\r\nsacrilegious crimes which impiety has dared to commit against the Supreme\r\nMaker of the universe.... My soul shudders and will not be able to return\r\nto tranquillity, until, in union with my children, my faithful subjects, I\r\noffer to God holocausts of piety.\" Thousands of persons were imprisoned, or\r\nforced to flee the country. On November 7, Riego was hanged. Young men were\r\nshot for being Freemasons. Women were sent to the galleys for owning\r\npictures of Riego.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Angoulême was indignant and would have nothing more to do with\r\nthe King. In a parting letter of remonstrance he wrote: \"I asked your\r\nMajesty to give an amnesty, and grant to your people some assurance for the\r\nfuture. You have done neither the one nor the other. Since your Majesty has\r\nrecovered your authority, nothing has been heard of on your part but\r\narrests and arbitrary edicts. Anxiety, fear, and discontent begin to spread\r\neverywhere.\" Angoulême returned to France thoroughly disenchanted with the\r\ncause for which he had drawn his sword.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French elections]\r\n\r\nIn France, as in England, the return of absolute rule in Spain was viewed\r\nwith extreme disfavor by the Liberals. The success of the French arms, to\r\nbe sure, gave the government an overwhelming majority at the elections. The\r\nvoice of the Liberals was heard, however, in the first debate over the\r\nSpanish war. Manuel, a Liberal deputy, denounced foreign intervention in\r\nSpain. He said: \"Can any one be ignorant that the misfortunes of the\r\nStuarts in England were caused by nothing so much as the assistance granted\r\nthem by France--an assistance foreign to the Parliament and to the people.\r\nThe Stuarts would have avoided the fate that overtook them had they sought\r\ntheir support within the nation.\" For this alleged defence of regicide\r\nManuel was excluded from the Chambers. On his refusal to give up his\r\nconstitutional rights, he was forcibly ejected by the National Guards. \"It\r\nis an insult to the National Guard,\" exclaimed the venerable Lafayette. In\r\nspite of the momentary triumph of the Royalists, Guizot's final verdict on\r\nFrench intervention in Spain expresses the true attitude of France:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guizot's verdict]\r\n\r\n\"The war was not popular in France; in fact, it was unjust, because\r\nunnecessary. The Spanish revolution, in spite of its excesses, exposed\r\nFrance and the Restoration to no serious risk; and the intervention was an\r\nattack upon the principle of the legitimate independence of States. It\r\nreally produced neither to Spain nor France any good result. It restored\r\nSpain to the incurable and incapable despotism of Ferdinand VII., without\r\nputting a stop to the revolutions; it substituted the ferocities of the\r\nabsolutist populace for that of the anarchical populace. Instead of\r\nconfirming the influence of France beyond the Pyrenees, it threw the King\r\nof Spain into the arms of the absolutist powers, and delivered up the\r\nSpanish Liberals to the protection of England.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this year in France occurred the deaths of Dumouriez, the famous\r\ngeneral of the Revolution, and of Marshal Davoust, the hero of Eckmühl,\r\nAuerstädt, and a score of other victories won during the Napoleonic\r\ncampaigns. At Rome, Pope Pius VII., the one time prisoner of Napoleon, died\r\nin old age, and was succeeded by Pope Leo XII.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Jenner]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vaccination]\r\n\r\nDr. Edward J. Jenner, the great English surgeon and originator of\r\nvaccination, died in the same year at London. Jenner was led to his great\r\ndiscovery by the remark of an old peasant woman: \"I can't catch smallpox,\r\nfor I have had cowpox.\" In 1796, Jenner performed the first vaccination on\r\na boy patient, James Phipps, whom he subsequently endowed with a house and\r\ngrounds. The scientific results of this experiment and those that followed\r\nwere embodied by Jenner in his \"Inquiry into the causes and effects of the\r\nvariolæ vaccinæ,\" published on the eve of the Nineteenth Century. Unlike so\r\nmany other medical innovations, Jenner's epoch-making cure for the dread\r\ndisease of smallpox won him almost instant general renown. Parliament, in\r\n1802, voted him a national reward of £10,000, and a few years later added\r\nanother gift of £20,000. After his death a public monument was erected to\r\nJenner's memory on Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amherst Governor in India]\r\n\r\nIn India, Lord Hastings retired from the governorship at Calcutta and was\r\nsucceeded by Lord Amherst. At the time of his accession to office, Dutch\r\ninfluence had already become paramount in Borneo, whereas the British were\r\nfirmly settled in Singapore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American letters]\r\n\r\nIn North America it was a year of industrial progress. On October 8, the\r\nfirst boat passed through the new Erie Canal from Rochester to New York. In\r\nBrooklyn the first three-story brick houses were built and the paving of\r\nstreets was begun. The new system of numbering houses came in vogue. The\r\nearliest steam printing press was set up in New York and issued its first\r\nbook. The manufacture of pins was begun, and wine in marketable quantities\r\nwas first made in Cincinnati. American letters saw the appearance of\r\nCooper's novels, \"The Pioneers\" and the \"Pilot.\" Halleck published his\r\nfamous poem, \"Marco Bozarris.\" During this year an American squadron under\r\nCommodore Porter put an end to piracy and freebooting in the West Indies.\r\nOn the first day of December the Eighteenth Congress met and Henry Clay was\r\nonce more elected Speaker of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1824\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American high tariff]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southern ascendency waning]\r\n\r\nIn January, a protective tariff bill was introduced in the American\r\nCongress. It was opposed by the South and by New England. On May 22,\r\nCongress, by a majority of five in the House and four in the Senate, passed\r\nClay's measure. The average rate of tariff was thirty-seven per cent.\r\nBefore the passage of the bill England had been importing goods more\r\ncheaply than Americans could manufacture them. American manufacturers could\r\nnow sell their goods at a profit. Even then there were believers in free\r\ntrade, who held that the country would naturally produce that which was\r\nprohibited, and that the productions which were brought into existence by\r\ntaxation put a portion of the people into unprofitable employment,\r\nadvantageous only to the manufacturers. But the Middle and Western States,\r\nwith the aid of the representatives from the manufacturing districts of New\r\nEngland, were strong enough to give the tariff a small majority. From 1824\r\nthe imposition of protective duties has been the bone of contention of the\r\ntwo great political parties in America. The economical struggle between\r\nprotection and free trade has since gone on with varying features.\r\nPolitical leadership in the United States was passing from the South to the\r\nNorth. New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio were fast pushing to the front.\r\nBuffalo had 20,000 population; and other interior towns were growing\r\nrapidly. Millions of acres of valuable lands were put under cultivation in\r\nthe central and western counties of New York and Pennsylvania and in Ohio;\r\nmanufacturing industries multiplied. From a sparsely inhabited country in\r\n1800, Ohio had grown, in 1824, to be the fifth State in population.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American letters]\r\n\r\nAmerican letters were enriched in this year by Irving's \"Tales of a\r\nTraveller,\" Paulding's \"John Bull,\" Bancroft's \"Politics in Ancient\r\nGreece,\" and Verplanck's \"Revealed Religion.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South American republics recognized]\r\n\r\nDuring the first session of Congress a special message from President\r\nMonroe recommended the establishment of intercourse with the new\r\nindependent States of South America--Venezuela, New Granada, Buenos Ayres,\r\nChile and Peru. Congress voted for recognition by an overwhelming majority,\r\nand the President signed the bill. The United States was the first among\r\nthe civilized powers to welcome the new republics.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for independence in South America was furthered more than ever\r\nby the unsatisfactory state of affairs on the Peninsula. In Spain the\r\nreturn of absolute rule was still followed by a reign of terror. The people\r\nthere relapsed into medieval barbarism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portuguese Constitution triumphant]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of republican sentiment]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iturbide shot]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Santa Anna in power]\r\n\r\nIn Portugal, the revolution stirred up by Dom Miguel ended with the\r\nexpulsion of that prince from Lisbon. His father, Dom Pedro, in Brazil,\r\nthought it wise to recognize the liberal constitution imposed upon him by\r\nhis people. In the other Latin-American countries the people rebelled\r\nagainst one-man rule. In Chile, General O'Higgins was forced to resign his\r\ndictatorship and a provisional Triumvirate assumed the government. At Lima,\r\nBolivar found his powers curtailed. Mariano Prado was elected president.\r\nThe feeling against imperialism was so strong in Central America that all\r\nthe smaller States joined in confederation to ward off this danger\r\nthreatening them from Mexico. The Junta of San Salvador went so far as to\r\npass a resolution favoring annexation by the United States of North America\r\nin case the Mexican imperialists crossed its borders. Eventually San\r\nSalvador, together with Nicaragua and Costa Rica, joined the Central\r\nAmerican Union. The first Congress in Costa Rica elected Juan Mora\r\npresident. In Mexico, in the meantime, a strong provisional government was\r\nestablished by Santa Anna. Ex-Emperor Iturbide, who in defiance of his\r\nexile returned to Mexico, was arrested as he landed at Sota la Marina in\r\nJuly. He was taken to the capital, tried, condemned, and shot. As he faced\r\ndeath he said: \"Mexicans, I die because I came to help you. I die gladly,\r\nbecause I die among you. I die not as a traitor, but with honor.\" With\r\nIturbide out of the way, Santa Anna established a government strong enough\r\nto accomplish the annexation of California. Henceforth there was no danger\r\nof a return to Spanish rule. In England, Canning followed Monroe with an\r\nabsolute recognition of the independent governments in America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Byron]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rhegas' hymn]\r\n\r\nBy this time public opinion in England had been aroused in behalf of the\r\nGreeks still struggling for their independence from the yoke of Turkey. A\r\npowerful impetus was given to this feeling by the tragic death of Lord\r\nByron in Greece. A few months before the poet had sailed from Genoa for\r\nGreece to take active part in the war for freedom. He died of fever at\r\nMissolonghi on April 19, at the age of thirty-six. One of his last poems\r\nwas a spirited translation of Rhegas' famous Greek national hymn:\r\n\r\n  Sons of the Greeks, arise!\r\n    The glorious hour shines forth,\r\n  And, worthy of such ties,\r\n    Display who gave us worth!\r\n\r\n  Sons of Greeks! let us go\r\n    In arms against the foe,\r\n  Till their hated blood shall flow\r\n    In a river past our feet.\r\n\r\n  Then manfully despise\r\n    The Turkish tyrant's yoke,\r\n  Let your country see you rise,\r\n    Till all her chains are broke.\r\n\r\n  Brave shades of chiefs and sages,\r\n    Behold the coming strife!\r\n  Greeks of past ages,\r\n    Oh, start again to life!\r\n\r\n  At the sound of my trumpet,\r\n    Break your sleep, join with me!\r\n  And the seven-hill'd city seek,\r\n    Fight, and win, till we are free!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goethe on Byron]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mazzini's verdict]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shelley's estimate]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Symonds' judgment]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Byron's best works]\r\n\r\nByron's death served the Greek cause better perhaps than all he could have\r\nachieved had his life been prolonged. It caused a greater stir throughout\r\nContinental Europe than it did in England. In truth Byron's poetry was\r\nmore appreciated by the world at large than by his countrymen--a literary\r\nanomaly that has prevailed even to the end of the Nineteenth Century.\r\nGoethe said of Byron after his death: \"The English may think of Byron as\r\nthey please; but this is certain, that they can show no poet who is to be\r\ncompared with him. He is different from all the others, and for the most\r\npart greater.\" Mazzini, many years later, concluded his famous essay on\r\nByron and Goethe with this vindication of the English poet's claim: \"The\r\nday will come when Democracy will remember all that it owes to Byron.\r\nEngland too, will, I hope, one day remember the mission--so entirely\r\nEnglish, yet hitherto overlooked by her--which Byron fulfilled on the\r\nContinent; the European cast given by him to English literature, and the\r\nappreciation and sympathy for England which he awakened among us.\" Shelley,\r\nwho knew Byron intimately, has given perhaps the best expression to the\r\nEnglish view of him. He said of him in 1822: \"The coarse music which he\r\nproduced touched a chord to which a million hearts responded.... Space\r\nwondered less at the swift and fair creations of God when he grew weary of\r\nvacancy, than I at this spirit of an angel in the mortal paradise of a\r\ndecaying body.\" To most Englishmen of his day, Byron, like Shelley,\r\nappeared as a monster of impious wickedness. Unlike Shelley, he attained\r\nthereby the vogue of the forbidden. His earliest poems achieved what the\r\nFrench call a _succès de scandal_. His satire, \"English Bards and Scotch\r\nReviewers,\" brought to the youthful poet a notoriety amounting to fame.\r\nAfter the publication of the first two cantos of \"Childe Harold,\" in 1812,\r\naccording to his own phrase, he awoke to find himself famous, and became a\r\nspoiled child of society. Trelawney has recorded that Byron was what London\r\nin the days of the Prince Regent made him. One of Byron's ablest critics,\r\nSymonds, has put this even more strongly: \"His judgment of the world was\r\nprematurely warped, while his naturally earnest feelings were overlaid with\r\naffectations and prejudices which he never succeeded in shaking off.... It\r\nwas his misfortune to be well born, but ill bred, combining the pride of a\r\npeer with the self-consciousness of a parvenu.\" Byron's life in London\r\nbetween 1812 and 1816 certainly increased his tendency to cynicism, as did\r\nhis divorce from his wife. While these experiences distorted his personal\r\ncharacter, they supplied him, however, with much of the irony wrought into\r\nhis masterpiece, \"Don Juan.\" His poetic genius derived its strongest\r\nstimulus from his imbittered domestic life and from his travels in Spain,\r\nItaly and Greece. This twofold character of the poet it is that is revealed\r\nin his best poems, \"Childe Harold\" and \"Don Juan.\" He used both works as\r\nreceptacles for the most incongruous ideas. \"If things are farcical,\" he\r\nonce said to Trelawney, \"they will do for 'Don Juan'; if heroical, you\r\nshall have another canto of 'Childe Harold.'\" This means of disposing of\r\nhis poetic ideas accounts for the great volume of Byron's verse as well as\r\nfor its inequality. That \"Don Juan\" was never finished cannot therefore be\r\nregretted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His last verses]\r\n\r\nByron's last verses were lines written on January 22, 1824, at Missolonghi.\r\nTo one of his English military associates in the expedition of Lepanto he\r\nremarked: \"You were complaining that I never write any poetry now. This is\r\nmy birthday, and I have just finished something which, I think, is better\r\nthan what I usually write.\" They were the famous lines, \"On this Day I\r\ncomplete my Thirty-sixth Year\":\r\n\r\n  'Tis time the heart should be unmoved,\r\n    Since others it hath ceased to move;\r\n  Yet, though I cannot be beloved,\r\n      Still let me love!\r\n\r\n  My days are in the yellow leaf;\r\n    The flowers and fruits of love are gone;\r\n  The worm, the canker, and the grief\r\n      Are mine alone!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Awake!

Kolokotrones, who set himself up against\r\nthe government of Konduriottes and Kolletes, was overthrown and lodged in\r\na prison on the island of Hydra. An offer of Russian intervention at the\r\nprice of Russian suzerainty was rejected by the Greeks. Encouraged by this,\r\nthe Sultan appealed to his vassal, Mehemet Ali of Egypt, to help him\r\nexterminate the Greeks. The island of Crete was held out to Mehemet Ali as\r\na prize. The ambitious ruler of Egypt responded with enthusiasm. He raised\r\nan army of 90,000 men and a fleet, and sent them forth under the command of\r\nhis adopted son Ibrahim. Early in the spring the Egyptian expedition landed\r\nin Crete and all but exterminated its Greek population. The island of\r\nKossos was next captured; and its inhabitants were butchered. In July, the\r\nTurkish fleet took advantage of the Greek Government's weakness to make a\r\ndescent upon Psara, one of the choicest islands of Greece. In spite of\r\ndesperate resistance, the citadel of Psara was stormed, and the Psariotes\r\nwere put to the sword. Thousands were slain, while the women and children\r\nwere carried off as slaves. How little the miseries of the Greeks affected\r\nthe rulers of Europe may be gathered from this bright side light on\r\nMetternich given by his secretary Gentz:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Metternich's comment]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of Turkish fleet]\r\n\r\n\"Prince Metternich was taking an excursion, in which unfortunately I could\r\nnot accompany him. I at once sent a letter after him from Ischl with the\r\nimportant news of the Psariote defeat.... The prince soon came back to me;\r\nand (pianissimo, in order that friends of Greece might not hear it) we\r\ncongratulated one another on the event, which may very well prove the\r\nbeginning of the end for the Greek insurrection.\" The Greeks, instead of\r\ndesponding, were aroused to fiercer resistance than ever. A Hydriote fleet\r\nfoiled Ibrahim Pasha's attempt on Samos. When he tried to return to Crete\r\nhis fleet was beaten back with a signal reverse. Finally, late in the year,\r\nthe Egyptians succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the Hydriote\r\nsea-captains, and regained their base of supplies in Crete.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Burmese war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Rangoon]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British checked at Donabew]\r\n\r\nWhile Canning's Ministry was still preparing the ground for European\r\nintervention in Greece, the British Government in India found itself with\r\nanother native war on its hands. In 1822, the Burmese leader Bundula had\r\ninvaded the countries between Burma and Bengal. The Burmese conquered the\r\nindependent principalities of Assam and Munipore, and threatened Cachar.\r\nNext Bundula invaded British territory and cut off a detachment of British\r\nsepoys. It was evident that the Burmese were bent on the conquest of\r\nBengal. Lord Amherst, who had assumed charge early in 1824, sent an\r\nexpedition against them under Sir Archibald Campbell. The resistance of the\r\nBurmese was despicable. The British soldiers nowhere found foes worthy of\r\ntheir steel. In May, the British expedition, having marched straight to\r\nBurma, occupied the capital Rangoon, which was found deserted and denuded\r\nof all supplies. Ill fed and far from succor, the British had to spend a\r\nrainy season there. Taking advantage of their precarious position, Bundula\r\nreturned late in the year with an army of 60,000 men. The Englishmen were\r\nbesieged. In December they made a successful sortie and stormed the\r\nBurmese stockades. Bundula with the remains of his army was driven up the\r\nbanks of the river Irawaddy. They made a stand at Donabew, some forty miles\r\nfrom Rangoon, where they held the British in check.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German letters]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the world throughout this year lay in profound peace. In\r\nGermany the rulers of the various principalities were allowed to continue\r\ntheir reigns undisturbed. Only in Brunswick the assumption of the\r\ngovernment by Charles Frederick William met with the disapproval of the\r\nGerman Diet. Although pronounced incapable of reigning, he succeeded none\r\nthe less in clinging to his throne. A more important event for the\r\nenlightened element in Germany was the appearance of the first of Leopold\r\nvon Ranke's great histories of the Romance and Teutonic peoples. In the\r\nrealm of poetry a stir was created by the publication of Rueckert's and\r\nBoerne's lyrics, and Heinrich Heine's \"Alamansor\" and \"Ratcliffe.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French literature]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clericals in the ascendant]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chateaubriand dismissed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Louis XVIII.]\r\n\r\nIn France, Lamartine brought out his \"Death of Socrates,\" and Louis Thiers\r\npublished the first instalments of his great \"History of the French\r\nRevolution.\" Simultaneously there appeared François Mignet's \"History of\r\nthe French Revolution.\" While these historians were expounding the lessons\r\nof this great regeneration of France, the Royalists in the Chambers did\r\ntheir best to undo its work. After the ejection of Manuel from the\r\nChambers, and the Ministers' consequent appeal to the country, the\r\nelections were so manipulated by the government that only nineteen Liberal\r\nmembers were returned to the Chambers. Immediate advantage was taken of\r\nthis to favor the Clericals and returned Emigrées, and to change the laws\r\nso as to elect a new House every seven years, instead of one-fifth part of\r\nthe Chamber each year. Monseigneur Frayssinous, the leader of the\r\nClericals, was made Minister of Public Instruction. The friction between\r\nPrime Minister Villèle and Chateaubriand was ended by Villèle's summary\r\ndismissal of Chateaubriand as Foreign Minister. Chateaubriand at once\r\nbecame the most formidable opponent of the Ministry in the \"Journal des\r\nDébats,\" and in the Chamber of Peers. At this stage of public affairs Louis\r\nXVIII. died, on September 16, with the ancient pomp of royalty. Before he\r\nexpired he said, pointing to his bed: \"My brother will not die in that\r\nbed.\" The old King's prophecy was based on the character of the French\r\npeople as much as on that of his brother. Indeed, Louis XVIII. was the only\r\nFrench ruler during the Nineteenth Century who died as a sovereign in his\r\nbed. He was duly succeeded by his brother, Count of Artois, who took the\r\ntitle \"Charles X.\" and retained Villèle as Minister of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1825\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles X.]\r\n\r\nCharles X. was crowned King of France in the Cathedral of Rheims. His first\r\npublic measure was the appropriation of a million francs to indemnify the\r\nFrench Royalists, whose lands had been confiscated during the French\r\nRevolution. Next came the proposal of a law on sacrilege, and one for\r\nprimogeniture. Both bills were strenuously opposed by the Liberals. Broglie\r\nexclaimed: \"What you are now preparing is a social and political\r\nrevolution, a revolution against the revolution which changed France nearly\r\nforty years ago.\" Old Lafayette was glad to leave the country to visit\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American election contest]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Quincy Adams President]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry Clay rewarded]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in American politics]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adams's first message]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the election of 1824 had to be decided by the House of\r\nRepresentatives. For the Presidency the candidates were Andrew Jackson,\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, Crawford and Clay, and for the Vice-Presidency Calhoun,\r\nSanford, Macon, Jackson, Van Buren and Clay. They all belonged to the\r\nDemocratic-Republican party. Jackson had received the highest number of\r\nelectoral votes--99 were for him and 84 for Adams. Calhoun, as candidate\r\nfor Vice-President, led with 182 votes. In the House of Representatives\r\nClay, as leader, opposed Jackson. Adams was declared President, with\r\nCalhoun for Vice-President. The electoral vote of thirteen States was given\r\nto Adams, while Jackson received seven. John Quincy Adams was then\r\nfifty-eight years of age. Washington had made him Minister to The Hague,\r\nand then to Lisbon, and in 1797 his father, then President, sent him as\r\nMinister to Berlin. In 1803, he was United States Senator. Six years later\r\nhe was Minister to Russia. During both of Monroe's terms he was Secretary\r\nof State. Upon his inauguration as President, Adams made Clay Secretary of\r\nState. Wirt, McLean and Southard were retained in the Cabinet. The\r\nadherents of Jackson declared that a bargain had been made between Clay and\r\nAdams, who then paid Clay they alleged for his support in the \"scrub race\"\r\nfor the Presidency. Randolph characterized the supposed arrangement as a\r\n\"bargain between the Puritan and the Black Leg,\" and in consequence was\r\nchallenged by Clay to fight a duel. Neither was injured. The election was\r\nfollowed by an immediate reorganization of political parties, on the\r\nquestion of supporting Adams's administration. Whether the successor of\r\nAdams should be a Northerner or a Southerner was the question at issue. His\r\nopponents were slave-holders and their Northern friends; his supporters,\r\nthe antagonists of the Democratic party, whether known as National\r\nRepublican, Whig or Republican party, all of which terms were in use. For\r\nthe first time the new Congress, under the reapportionment, represented the\r\nentire population of the country, with New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio in\r\nthe lead. In the Senate were men of brilliant promise. Clay was still a\r\nleader, and so was Webster, in the rising majesty of his renown. The\r\ncontest between the parties was narrowed down to two great issues--internal\r\nimprovements under national auspices and tariff for the protection of\r\nmanufactures. President Adams in his first message gave opportunity for\r\nconcerted opposition. He took advanced ground in favor of national\r\nexpenditure on internal improvements, and urged the multiplication of\r\ncanals, the endowment of a national university, expenditures for scientific\r\nresearch, and the erection of a national observatory. He announced that an\r\ninvitation had been accepted from the South American states to a conference\r\nat Panama, in regard to the formation of a political and commercial league\r\nbetween the two Americas. The Senate requested President Adams to give it\r\ninformation \"touching the principles and practice of the Spanish-American\r\nstates, or any of them--in regard to negro slavery.\" The subject was\r\ndebated for almost the entire session. When enough had been said to show\r\nthat slavery must not be interfered with, the delegates were nominated and\r\nan appropriation was made. The delegates never went.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Erie Canal completed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beneficial results]\r\n\r\nOn November 4, the first boat travelling along the new Erie Canal reached\r\nNew York. Through the efforts of De Witt Clinton, the State of New York\r\nwithout Congressional aid had completed the great Erie Canal. Its annual\r\ntolls were found to amount to half its cost. The financial and commercial\r\nresults of the great work were immediate and manifest. The cost of\r\ncarrying freight between Albany and New York was reduced from the 1820 rate\r\nof $88 per ton, to $22.50, and soon to $6.50. Travel was no less\r\nfacilitated, so that it was possible for emigrants to reach Michigan,\r\nIllinois and Wisconsin cheaply. These fertile States grew accordingly in\r\npopulation. In 1825 the Capitol at Washington was nearly completed; the\r\nouter walls proved to be uninjured by the fire of 1814. The foundation of\r\nthe central building had been laid in 1818, and this edifice was now\r\ncompleted on its original plan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lafayette visits America]\r\n\r\nThe American visit of the old Marquis de la Fayette--to give him his French\r\nname--was celebrated with national rejoicings. Years ago, when he left the\r\nAmerican republic after its independence was achieved, it was a poor, weak\r\nand struggling nation. Its prosperity and increasing power now amazed him.\r\nThe thirteen colonies along the coast had increased to twenty-four\r\nindependent, growing and progressive commonwealths, reaching a thousand\r\nmiles westward from the sea. Lafayette was the nation's guest for a year.\r\nOn June 17, 1825, just fifty years after the battle of Bunker Hill, he laid\r\nthe cornerstone of the obelisk which commemorates that battle in Boston. On\r\nthis same occasion Daniel Webster made one of his great speeches. Lafayette\r\nreturned to France in the American frigate \"Brandywine,\" named in honor of\r\nthe first battle in which Lafayette fought and was wounded half a century\r\nbefore. Congress presented him with a gift of $200,000 in money, and with a\r\ntownship of land in recognition of the disinterested services of his\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Argentine Republic]\r\n\r\nShortly before President Adams accepted the invitation to send North\r\nAmerican representatives to the proposed Congress of Panama, thirteen\r\nindependent States joined at Buenos Ayres in a powerful confederation and\r\nformed the Republic of Argentine. A national constitution was adopted and\r\nRivadiera elected President. The new republic was soon called upon to prove\r\nits mettle in the war levied against it by Brazil for the possession of\r\nUruguay. In the end Uruguay remained a part of Argentina. Brazil had\r\npreviously achieved its complete independence from the mother country by\r\nassuming the public debt of Portugal, amounting to some ten million\r\ndollars. England gave its official recognition to these new changes of\r\ngovernment as it had to the others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Burmese reverses]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New British acquisitions]\r\n\r\nThe British war against the Burmese was nearly over. Early in the year the\r\nBritish forces left at Rangoon advanced up the river Irawaddy toward\r\nDonabew. The first attempt to take this stronghold was repulsed, whereupon\r\nthe British settled down to a regular siege. While trying to get the range\r\nwith their mortars the gunners succeeded in killing Bundula, the chieftain\r\nof the Burmese. His brother flinched from the command of the army and was\r\npromptly beheaded. The Burmese forces went to pieces. The British proceeded\r\nto Prome, and inflicted another crushing defeat on the remaining\r\ndetachments of the Burmese army. At the approach of the British column the\r\nBurmese rulers at Ava became frantic. All the demented women that could be\r\nfound in and about Ava were gathered together and conducted to the front\r\nthat they might bewitch the English. When this measure proved ineffectual,\r\nPrince Tharawadi tried to stem the British approach, but could not get his\r\nfollowers to face the enemy. All the country from Rangoon to Ava was under\r\nBritish control. The Burmese came to terms. As a result of the conflict the\r\nterritories of Assam, Arrakan and Tenaserim were ceded to the British.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crisis in Bhurtpore]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary British dealings]\r\n\r\nWhile the British were still in the midst of this campaign a crisis\r\noccurred in Bhurtpore. The sudden death of the Rajah there left no\r\nsuccessor to the throne but an infant son of seven. He was proclaimed Rajah\r\nunder the guardianship of his uncle. A cousin of the dead king won over the\r\narmy of Bhurtpore, and putting the uncle to death imprisoned the little\r\nRajah. Sir David Ochterlony, the aged British Resident at Delhi, interfered\r\nin behalf of the little prince and advanced British troops into Bhurtpore.\r\nHis measures were repudiated by Lord Amherst. Sir David took the rebuff so\r\nmuch to heart that he resigned his appointment. Within two months after his\r\nretirement the old soldier died in bitterness of soul. The sequel\r\nvindicated his judgment. In defiance of the British Government, the usurper\r\nof Bhurtpore rallied around him all the dissatisfied spirits of the\r\nMahrattas, Pindarees, Jats and Rajputs. Lord Amherst was forced to retreat\r\nto Vera. The British army under Lord Combermere crossed the border and\r\npushed through to Bhurtpore. The heavy mud walls of the capital had to be\r\nbreached with mines. The usurper was deposed and put out of harm's way in a\r\nBritish prison. With the restoration of the infant Prince in Bhurtpore, all\r\ndanger of another great Indian rising seemed at end.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SOLFERINO\r\n    Painted by E.

The first public railway for steam locomotives was\r\nopened between Stockton and Darlington by Edward Peese and George\r\nStephenson--an innovation which caused great excitement throughout England.\r\nOn the opening day, September 27, an immense concourse of people assembled\r\nalong the line to see the train go by. Nearly every one prophesied that the\r\n\"iron horse\" would be a failure. The train weighed about ninety English\r\ntons, and consisted of six wagons loaded with coal and flour, then a\r\ncovered coach containing directors and proprietors, with twenty-one coal\r\nwagons fitted up for invited passengers, nearly 600 in number. Stephenson's\r\nengine, named the \"Locomotion,\" had a ten-foot boiler and weighed not quite\r\n1,500 pounds. As six miles an hour was supposed to be the limit of speed,\r\nit was arranged that a man on horseback should ride on the track ahead of\r\nthe engine carrying a flag. The train was started without difficulty amid\r\ncheers. Many tried to keep up with it by running, and some gentlemen on\r\nhorseback galloped across the fields to accompany the train. After a few\r\nminutes, Stephenson shouted to the horseman with the flag to get out of the\r\nway, for he was going to \"let her go.\" Ordering the fireman to \"keep her\r\nhot, lad,\" he opened wide the throttle-valve and the speed was quickly\r\nraised to twelve miles an hour and then to fifteen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stephenson's practical demonstration]\r\n\r\nThe runners on foot, the gentlemen on horseback and the horseman with the\r\nflag were left far behind. So, with the cross-beams and side-rods trembling\r\nfrom the violent motion, the red-hot chimney ejecting clouds of black\r\nsmoke, amid the cheers of the delighted spectators and to the astonishment\r\nof the passengers--the immortal George Stephenson brought his train safely\r\ninto Darlington.\r\n\r\nAs the \"Newcastle Courant\" (October 1, 1825) put it, \"certainly the\r\nperformance excited the astonishment of all present, and exceeded the most\r\nsanguine expectations of every one conversant with the subject. The engine\r\narrived at Stockton in three hours and seven minutes after leaving\r\nDarlington, including stops, the distance being nearly twelve miles, which\r\nis at the rate of four miles an hour; and upon the level part of the\r\nrailway, the number of passengers was counted about four hundred and fifty,\r\nand several more clung to the carriages on each side. At one time the\r\npassengers by the engine had the pleasure of accompanying and cheering\r\ntheir brother passengers by the stage coach, which passed alongside, and of\r\nobserving the striking contrast exhibited by the power of the engine and of\r\nhorses; the engine with her six hundred passengers and load, and the coach\r\nwith four horses and only sixteen passengers.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immediate railroad development]\r\n\r\nSo successful was the Stockton and Darlington railway that a bill was\r\nbrought in Parliament for the construction of a railroad between Liverpool\r\nand Manchester after Stephenson's plan. The scheme was violently opposed.\r\nIts detractors, among whom were Lords Lefton and Derby, declared that\r\nStephenson's locomotive would poison the air, kill the birds as they flew\r\nover them, destroy the preservation of pheasants, burn up the farms and\r\nhomesteads near the lines; that oats and hay would become unsalable because\r\nhorses would become extinct; travelling on the highways would become\r\nimpossible; country inns would be ruined; boilers would burst and kill\r\nhundreds of passengers. Indeed, there was no peril imaginable that was not\r\npredicted to attend the working of a railroad by steam.\r\n\r\nWhen Stephenson was examined by a Parliamentary committee, one of the\r\nmembers put this question: \"Suppose, now, one of these engines to be going\r\nalong a railroad at a rate of nine or ten miles an hour, and that a cow\r\nwere to stray upon the line, and get in the way of the engine, would not\r\nthat, think you, be a very awkward circumstance?\" \"Yaw,\" replied\r\nStephenson, in his broad Northumbrian dialect, \"ay, awkward--for the\r\n_coo_.\" On account of his speech Stephenson was denounced as a \"foreigner,\"\r\nand the bill was thrown out by the committee, by a vote of 37 against 36.\r\nAfter a second Parliamentary battle, the bill was passed through both\r\nHouses by a majority of forty-seven votes. The passage of the act cost\r\n£27,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other modern inventions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English financial crisis averted]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canning's attempted reforms]\r\n\r\nAlmost coincidentally, Faraday found that benzine was a constituent of\r\npetroleum, a discovery destined to affect the modern construction of\r\nautomobile vehicles toward the close of the century. A number of other\r\nachievements made this an important year for science in England. John\r\nCrowther took out a patent for his invention of a hydraulic crane. The\r\nsteam jet was first applied to construction work by Timothy Hackworth.\r\nJoseph Clement built a planing machine for iron. One of the earliest chain\r\nsuspension bridges was erected at Menai Strait by Thomas Thelford, and at\r\nthe same time Brunel sunk his first shaft for the Thames tunnel.\r\nSignificant of the industrial revival of those days was the opening of\r\nmechanics' institutes at Exeter and Belfast. In Canada, the newly founded\r\nMcGill College was raised to the rank of a university. A financial measure\r\nof far-reaching import was the Bank of England's sudden diminution of its\r\ncirculation to the extent of £3,500,000 by the combined exertions of the\r\nbank and of the royal mint. A crisis in public funds was thus averted. The\r\nmost important political measure of the year was Canning's attempt to\r\nrepeal the political disabilities of the Catholics in England. A bill to\r\nthis effect was passed through the Commons, but was thrown out by the House\r\nof Lords. Canning's friend Huskisson inaugurated a commercial policy, which\r\nwas founded on the theory of free trade, destined to bring about the repeal\r\nof the corn laws.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greek reverses]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nauplia and Missolonghi besieged]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greece devastated]\r\n\r\nThe situation in Greece was calculated to stiffen the backbone of Canning's\r\nforeign policy. On February 22, Ibrahim's Egyptian army had crossed the sea\r\nunopposed and overran the Morea. The Greeks were defeated near Nodoni, and\r\nthe garrison of Sphakteria was overwhelmed. The forts of Navarino\r\ncapitulated. In vain was old Kolokotrones released from his prison to\r\noppose the onslaught of Ibrahim's Arabs. The Greeks were driven back\r\nthrough Tripolitza, and did not succeed in making a stand until the Turks\r\nreached Nauplia. Here Demetrios Ypsilanti with a few hundred men repulsed\r\nthe Turkish vanguard at Lerna. Ibrahim settled down to the siege of Nauplia\r\nand of Missolonghi. The country round about was laid waste and the people\r\nkilled. Ibrahim's hordes even cut down all trees and saplings. Thus the\r\nfertile mountains and hillsides of Greece were changed into the barren\r\nrocks they are to-day. Nothing so excited the sympathy of the lovers of\r\nliberty in Europe as these wanton ravages on classic soil committed by the\r\nsavages of the desert. Even Alexander of Russia was so moved by the rising\r\nindignation of his people that he dissolved diplomatic conferences at St.\r\nPetersburg in August. He issued a declaration that Russia, acting on its\r\nown discretion, would put a stop to the outrages of Greece. Accompanied by\r\nthe leaders of the Russian war party, he left St. Petersburg and travelled\r\nto the Black Sea. All Europe waited for the long-threatened Russian advance\r\non Constantinople. Suddenly news arrived that the Czar had died at\r\nTaganrog.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Czar Alexander]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexander's early reforms]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian letters stimulated]\r\n\r\nAlexander expired on November 19 (December 1), in the arms of Empress\r\nElizabeth. His last hours were clouded by revelations of a plot to\r\nassassinate him. As if to recant his reactionary measures of the last few\r\nyears, he said: \"They may say what they like of me, but I have lived and\r\nwill die republican\"--a curious boast which is justified only by the\r\nearlier years of Alexander's reign. In the beginning of his rule the Czar\r\nreversed the despotic tendencies of his predecessors. Free travel was\r\npermitted; foreign books and papers were allowed to enter; the better\r\nclasses of the community were exempted from corporal punishments; the\r\nemancipation of serfs was begun, and the collegiate organization of the\r\nadministration was supplanted by ministries modelled after those of the\r\nchief European countries. As early as 1802 Alexander could boast of a\r\nCabinet as good as that of any constitutional monarch. Another far-reaching\r\nreform was the reorganization of Russian public education, and the\r\nencouragement given to the publication of Bibles. A temporary relaxation of\r\nthe censorship resulted in the foundation of societies of literature and of\r\nsuch journals as the \"Russian Messenger,\" \"The Northern Mercury,\" and the\r\n\"Democrat.\" Writers like Pushkin and Gogol brought forth their earliest\r\nworks. Koltsov discovered a new source of poetry in the popular songs.\r\nLermontov sang the wild beauty of the Caucasus, and Ozerov wrote his\r\nclassical drama \"Dmitri Donskoi,\" which recalled the struggles of Russia\r\nagainst the Tartars. Modern romantic tendencies were advanced by\r\nJoukovsky's translation of Schiller's and Byron's poems. Ginka composed the\r\nscores for his earlier operas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes for the worse]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Araktcheyev]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russian succession]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conflicting proclamations]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nicholas, Czar of Russia]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moscow mutiny]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miloradovitch shot]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of revolt]\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander came under the influence of Madame de Krüdener and the more\r\nbaneful ascendency of Metternich everything was changed for the worse. The\r\npublication of Bibles was stopped; the censorship was re-established in its\r\nfull rigor; Speranski's great undertaking of a Russian code of laws was\r\nnipped in the bud; Galytsin, the liberal Minister of Publication, had to\r\nresign, and Araktcheyev, a reactionary of extreme type, was put in his\r\nplace. Some idea of the dark days that followed may be gathered from\r\nAraktcheyev's first measures. The teaching of the geological theories of\r\nBuffon and of the systems of Copernicus and Newton were forbidden as\r\ncontrary to Holy Writ. Medical dissection was prohibited, and the practice\r\nof medicine was reduced to that of faith cure. All professors who had\r\nstudied at seats of learning abroad were dismissed. Then it was that the\r\nsecret societies sprang up in Poland and in the north and south of Russia.\r\nOne of the foremost conspirators was Pestel, who had undertaken to frame a\r\nnew code of laws for Russia. When Alexander died, Russia was on the brink\r\nof a military revolution. It was the intention of the conspirators to\r\nassassinate the Czar in the presence of his troops and to proclaim a\r\nconstitution; but his unexpected departure to the Black Sea frustrated the\r\nplan. Alexander's death threw the Russian court into confusion. For a while\r\nit was not known who was to succeed him. The supposed heir to the throne\r\nwas Alexander's brother, Constantine. Unbeknown to the people he had\r\nformally renounced his right to the throne. At the time of his brother's\r\ndeath he was in Warsaw. His younger brother, Nicholas, at St. Petersburg,\r\nhad him proclaimed emperor. When they brought him Constantine's written\r\nabdication, Nicholas refused to acknowledge it and caused the troops to\r\ntake their oath of allegiance to his brother. Constantine in Warsaw\r\nproclaimed Nicholas emperor. Nicholas would not accept the crown unless by\r\nthe direct command of his elder brother. At length the matter was adjusted,\r\nafter an interregnum of three weeks. On Christmas Day, Nicholas ascended\r\nthe imperial throne. The confusion at St. Petersburg was turned to account\r\nby the military conspirators who had plotted against Alexander's life. To\r\nthe common soldiers they denounced Nicholas as a usurper who was trying to\r\nmake them break their recent oath to Constantine. When ordered to take the\r\noath to Nicholas, the Moscow regiment refused, and marched to the open\r\nplace in front of the Senate House. There they formed a square and were\r\njoined by other bodies of mutineering soldiers. It is gravely asserted by\r\nRussian historians that the poor wretches, ignorant of the very meaning of\r\nthe word constitution, shouted for it, believing it to be the name of\r\nConstantine's wife. An attack upon them by the household cavalry was\r\nrepulsed. When General Miloradovitch, a veteran of fifty-two battles\r\nagainst Napoleon, tried to make himself heard, he was shot. The mutineers\r\nwould not listen even to the Emperor. Not until evening could the new Czar\r\nbe brought to use more decisive measures. Then he ordered out the artillery\r\nand had them fire grapeshot into the square. The effect was appalling. In a\r\nfew minutes the square was cleared and the insurrection was over. Its\r\nleaders were wanting at the moment of action. A rising in the south of\r\nRussia was quelled by a single regiment. Before the year ended, Nicholas\r\nwas undisputed master of Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Fresnel]\r\n\r\nBy the death of Augustin Jean Fresnel, France lost a brilliant scientist,\r\nwho shares with Thomas Young the honor of discrediting the old emission\r\ntheory of light, and of formulating the undulatory theory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of David]\r\n\r\nJacques Louis David, founder of the new French school of classicism in\r\npainting, died at the close of the year at Brussels. Many of his paintings\r\nwere on exhibition before the fall of the old régime in France. In the days\r\nof the French Revolution, David was a Jacobite and friend of Robespierre,\r\nand suffered in prison after the latter's fall. It was not, however, until\r\nthe time of the First Empire that David's fame spread. He then reached the\r\nzenith of his success. His masterpieces of this period are \"Napoleon\r\nCrossing the Alps\"--a canvas on which is founded Hauff's story of \"The\r\nPicture of the Emperor\"--\"The Coronation of Napoleon,\" \"Napoleon in His\r\nImperial Robes,\" and the \"Distribution of the Eagles.\" Equally famous is\r\nhis portrait of \"Madame Recamier resting on a Chaiselongue.\" After the fall\r\nof the First Empire, David was exiled from France, and retired to\r\nBrussels. David, unlike so many other beneficiaries of the Empire, remained\r\nwarmly attached to Napoleon. Once when the Duke of Wellington visited his\r\nstudio in Brussels and expressed a wish that the great artist would paint\r\nhim, David coldly replied, \"I never paint Englishmen.\" In his declining\r\nyears he painted subjects taken from Grecian mythology. Among the paintings\r\nexecuted by David during his banishment were \"Love and Psyche,\" \"The Wrath\r\nof Achilles,\" and \"Mars Disarmed by Venus.\" The number of David's pupils\r\nwho acquired distinction was very great, among whom the best known were\r\nGros, Gérard, Derdranais Girodet, Jugros, Abel de Pujel and Droming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1826\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Czar Nicholas' measures]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ryleyev and Pestel hanged]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian laws codified]\r\n\r\nDriven to assert his rights to the crown by bloodshed, Nicholas I. showed\r\nhimself resolved to maintain the absolute principles of his throne. He\r\naccorded a disdainful pardon to Prince Trubetskoi, whom the conspirators of\r\nthe capital had chosen as head of the government. The mass of misled\r\nsoldiery was likewise treated with clemency. But against the real\r\ninstigators of the insurrection the Czar proceeded with uncompromising\r\nseverity. One hundred and twenty were deported to Siberia; and the five\r\nforemost men, among whom were Ryleyev, the head of the society in the\r\nnorth, and Pestel, were condemned to be hanged. All died courageously.\r\nPestel's chief concern was for his Code: \"I am certain,\" said he, \"that one\r\nday Russia will find in this book a refuge against violent commotions. My\r\ngreatest error was that I wished to gather the harvest before sowing the\r\nseed.\" In a way the teachings of these men gave an impetus to Russia that\r\ntheir death could not destroy. Even the Czar, with his passion for military\r\nautocracy, made it his first care to take up the work of codifying the\r\nRussian laws. Alexis Mikhaielovitch during the next four years turned out\r\nhis \"Complete Code of the Laws of the Russian Empire.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persian war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defence of Choucha]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian victories]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persia abandoned by England]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia's ultimatum to Turkey]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Janizaries]\r\n\r\nThe military ambitions of Nicholas found a vent in the direction of Persia.\r\nThe encroachments of Ermolov, the Governor-General of the Caucasus, so\r\nexasperated the Persians that soon a holy war was preached against Russia.\r\nEbbas-Mirza, the Prince Royal of Persia, collected an army of 35,000 men on\r\nthe banks of the Araxes. A number of English officers joined his ranks.\r\nNicholas at once despatched General Kasevitch with reinforcements for\r\nErmolov. Ebbas-Mirza was checked on his march on Tivlas by the heroic\r\ndefence of Choucha. In the meanwhile the Russians concentrated their\r\nforces. The Persian vanguard, 15,000 strong, was defeated at Elizabethpol.\r\nOn the banks of the Djeham, Paskevitch, with a division of the Russian\r\narmy, overthrew the main body of the Persians and forced them back over the\r\nAraxes. The Persians continued their resistance, relying on the terms of\r\nthe treaty of Teheran, wherein England had promised financial and military\r\nsubsidies in case of invasion. The English, promise was not kept. Hence\r\nforth the Persians were at the mercy of the Russian army of invasion.\r\nAlmost simultaneously a rebellion against the Chinese Government broke out\r\nin Kashgar. Undeterred by this diversion, Nicholas took up a vigorous stand\r\nagainst the Turks. In March he presented an ultimatum insisting on the\r\nautonomy of Moldavia, Wallachia and Servia, and on the final cession to\r\nRussia of disputed Turkish territory on the Asiatic frontier. Turkey\r\nyielded. Nicholas then joined in an ultimatum with England and France for\r\nan immediate stop of the Turkish outrages in Greece. In this matter\r\nNicholas, who regarded the Greeks as rebels, showed himself more lenient to\r\nthe Turks, and negotiations with the Porte were permitted to drag. The\r\nSultan profited by the lull to execute a long contemplated stroke against\r\nthe Janizaries. The whole of this famous corps of bodyguards was massacred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Bennigsen and Rostopchin]\r\n\r\nDuring this year two men died in Russia who had distinguished themselves at\r\nthe time of Napoleon's invasion. One was General Bennigsen, a soldier of\r\nGerman extraction and training, who took a leading part in all the Russian\r\ncampaigns against Napoleon. The other was Prince Rostopchin, who as\r\nGovernor of Moscow consigned that city to the flames after Napoleon's\r\ntriumphant entry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Hastings and Heber]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alfred Tennyson]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English letters flourishing]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scientific progress]\r\n\r\nEngland lost two men who had distinguished themselves in India. One was the\r\nMarquis of Hastings, who had but lately relinquished his\r\nGovernor-Generalship of British India, and whose rule there both from a\r\nmilitary and from a political-economical point of view must be regarded as\r\npre-eminently successful. The other was Reginald Heber, the Bishop of\r\nCalcutta, who endeared himself to Anglo-Indians by his translations of the\r\nfolk songs and classic writings of Hindustan. In other respects this year\r\nis notable in English literary annals. Alfred Tennyson published his\r\nearliest verses in conjunction with his brother; Elizabeth Barrett also\r\nbrought out her first poems; Macaulay had begun to captivate England by his\r\nessays; Thomas Hood issued his \"Whims and Oddities\"; Scott and Coleridge\r\nwere then in the heyday of literary favor. Scott had just brought out his\r\n\"Talisman\" and \"The Betrothed,\" and now published \"Woodstock.\" Coleridge\r\ncontributed his \"Aids to Reflection.\" A new impetus was given to\r\nscholarship by the foundation of the Western and Eastern literary\r\ninstitutions of England, and the establishment of a professorship for\r\npolitical economy at Oxford. London University was chartered. Drummond's\r\nnamesake, Lieutenant Thomas Drummond, perpetuated his name by his\r\nlimelight, produced by heating lime to incandescence in the oxy-hydrogen\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English lotteries suppressed]\r\n\r\nWhile Herschel was working out his spectrum analysis, Fox Talbot\r\ncontributed his share by his observation of the orange line of strontium.\r\nJohn Walker perfected his invention of friction matches. Industrially, on\r\nthe contrary, England still suffered from the canker of the corn laws and\r\nthe recent financial crisis resulting from the operations of ill-fated\r\nstock companies. In Lancashire nearly a thousand power looms were destroyed\r\nby the distressed operatives. Some relief was given by Canning's abolition\r\nof all public lotteries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis I. of Bavaria]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Munich embellished]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German romantic literature]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Die Wacht am Rhein\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Froebel]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, arts and literature flourished in the same degree. King Louis\r\nI. of Bavaria, upon his accession to the throne, gathered about him in\r\nMunich some of the foremost artists and writers of Germany. The capital of\r\nMunich was embellished with public monuments; public buildings were\r\ndecorated with fresco paintings, and art galleries were established. The\r\nUniversity of Bavaria was transferred from Landshut to Munich, and other\r\ninstitutions of learning were erected by its side. Streets were widened,\r\nnew avenues and public squares laid out, and public lighting introduced\r\nthroughout the city. Within a short time the quasi-medieval town of Munich\r\nwas changed into a modern metropolis and became the Mecca of German art.\r\nAmong the artists who gathered round Louis of Bavaria were Moritz von\r\nSchwind, Cornelius, Hess, Raupp, and the elder Piloti. Among the writers\r\nwho drew upon themselves the notice of this liberal king were the Count of\r\nPlaten, who during this year published his \"Ghazels\" and the comedy \"The\r\nFatal Fork\"; and Hauff, who brought out his romantic masterpiece,\r\n\"Lichtenstein.\" Of the rising writers, Heinrich Heine alone withstood the\r\nblandishments of Louis with verses of biting satire. Little noticed at the\r\ntime was the appearance of Reichardt's \"Wacht am Rhein,\" a song which was\r\ndestined to become the battle hymn of Germany. Scant attention, likewise,\r\nwas given to Froebel's epoch-making work, \"The Education of Man.\" On the\r\nother hand much pother was made over some curious exchanges of sovereignty,\r\ncharacteristic of German politics in those days. The Dukes of\r\nSaxe-Coburg-Gotha-Meiningen exchanged their respective possessions.\r\nSaalfeld Meiningen received Gotha. Altenburg was assigned to\r\nSaxe-Hilburghausen, which latter principality in turn was relinquished to\r\nMeiningen. The settlements of the succession in those petty principalities\r\ncalled forth volumes of legal lore.\r\n\r\nJens Baggesen, the most prolific Danish humorist, died this year,\r\nseventy-two years of age. After his death Baggesen's writings declined in\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American semi-centennial]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Jefferson and Adams]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Father of Democracy\"]\r\n\r\nIn America, the people of the United States commemorated the\r\nsemi-centennial of their independence. The Fourth of July, the date of the\r\ndeclaration of American independence, was the great day of celebration. The\r\nday became noted in American history by the simultaneous death of two\r\npatriots: Jefferson and Adams. Thomas Jefferson's greatest achievements, as\r\nrecorded by himself on his gravestone at Monticello, were his part in the\r\ndeclaration of American independence, in the establishment of religious\r\nfreedom and in the foundation of the University at Virginia. He was the\r\nmost philosophic statesman of his time in America. Much of the subsequent\r\nhistory of the United States was but the development of Jefferson's\r\npolitical ideas. His public acts and declarations foreshadowed the policies\r\nof his most worthy successors. The essentials of the Monroe Doctrine, of\r\nthe emancipation of slaves, as well as of the doctrine of State rights and\r\nof American expansion, can all be traced back to him. Thus he has come to\r\nbe venerated by one of the two great political parties of America as \"The\r\nFather of Democracy.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jefferson's principles]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Third term discountenanced]\r\n\r\nJefferson's principles were stated in his first inaugural address: \"Equal\r\nand exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or\r\npolitical; peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations,\r\nentangling alliances with none; the support of the State governments and\r\nall their rights as the most competent of administrations for our domestic\r\nconcerns; the preservation of the general government in its whole\r\nconstitutional vigor, as a sheet anchor of peace at home and safety\r\nabroad.... The supremacy of civil over military authority; economy in\r\npublic expense, honest payment of public debts; the diffusion of\r\ninformation; freedom of religion; freedom of the press and freedom of the\r\nperson, under the protection of the habeas corpus and trial by jury.\" When\r\nJefferson's second term as President came to an end he retired from the\r\nWhite House poorer than he had entered it. A third term was declined by him\r\nwith these words: \"To lay down a public charge at the proper period is as\r\nmuch a duty as to have borne it faithfully. If some termination to the\r\nservices of a chief magistrate be not fixed by the Constitution or supplied\r\nby practice, this office, nominally four years, will in fact become for\r\nlife; and history shows how easily that degenerates into an inheritance.\"\r\nTogether with Washington's similar action, this established a custom which\r\nhas since been followed in the North American Republic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Adams's career]\r\n\r\nJefferson's predecessor, John Adams, who died on the same day, though\r\nlikewise a model President, was less fortunate in his career. His\r\nadministration was a struggle almost from beginning to end. The troubles\r\nwith France, though not attaining the dignity of international warfare,\r\npresented all the difficulties of such a war. Adams's extreme measures\r\nagainst domestic danger, as embodied in his \"alien and sedition laws,\" were\r\nunfortunate. They were in fact an infringement of the rights of free\r\nspeech and personal liberty, and were with justice denounced as\r\nunconstitutional and un-American. His departure from the American Bill of\r\nRights among other things effectually prevented his re-election as\r\nPresident. His wisest closing act was the appointment of John Marshall to\r\nthe Chief Justiceship of the American Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stars of the stage]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Last of the Mohicans\"]\r\n\r\nIn the annals of the American stage the season of 1826 is remembered for\r\nthe first appearance of the three great actors Edwin Forrest, Macready and\r\nJames H. Hackett, the American comedian. The same year saw the first\r\nappearance of Paulding's \"Three Wise Men of Gotham,\" and Cooper's \"Last of\r\nthe Mohicans.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philhellenic efforts]\r\n\r\nThe Greek cause found friends in Switzerland, England and America. Two\r\nloans for $14,000,000 were raised in London by American and English\r\nsubscriptions. Both loans were disgracefully financed. Barely one-half of\r\nthe amount was finally accounted for. With the proceeds contracts were made\r\nfor eight warships. The \"Perseverance,\" a steam corvette, mounting eight\r\n68-pound cannon, reached Nauplia in September. The \"Hope,\" a staunch\r\nfrigate of 64 guns, built in New York, arrived in December. She was\r\nrechristened the \"Hellas.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dom Pedro IV.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Dom Juan de Braganza in March had placed the throne of\r\nPortugal as well as that of Brazil at the disposal of his oldest son, Dom\r\nPedro IV., at Rio. Under the terms of England's mediation of the previous\r\nyear, Dom Pedro renounced the throne of Portugal in favor of his infant\r\ndaughter, Maria Gloria, while at the same time he conferred upon Portugal a\r\nliberal constitution, the so-called Charta de Ley, similar to that conceded\r\nto Brazil in 1822.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dom Miguel's revolt]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canning's policy]\r\n\r\nDom Pedro IV. had intrusted the throne of Portugal to the regency of his\r\nsister Maria Isabella, on condition that his infant daughter should marry\r\nher uncle, Dom Miguel. It was his intention that the infant Princess should\r\nbe recognized as Queen, while Dom Miguel would reign as regent. Under the\r\nleadership of Marquis de Chaves, instigated by Dom Miguel, several\r\nprovinces revolted and declared for Miguel as absolute king. Conquered in\r\nPortugal, the insurgents retired to Spain, where they were well received.\r\nThe Portuguese constitutional government called for help from England.\r\nFrance threatened to invade Spain. Canning acted at once: \"To those who\r\nblame the government for delay,\" declared Canning in Parliament, \"the\r\nanswer is very short. It was only last Friday that I received the official\r\nrequest from Portugal. On Saturday the Ministers decided what was to be\r\ndone. On Sunday our decision received the King's sanction. On Monday it was\r\ncommunicated to both Houses. At this very moment the troops are on their\r\nway to Portugal.\" It was then that Canning delivered the great speech in\r\ndefence of his foreign policy which he closed with Shakespeare's famous\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n                          Oh, it is excellent\r\n     To have a giant's strength. And it is tyrannous\r\n     To use it like a giant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1827\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portuguese revolt suppressed]\r\n\r\nOn the first day of January an English army corps under Clinton was landed\r\nat Lissabon and a squadron of eleven British ships of the line came to\r\nanchor at the mouth of the Tagus. The news of this foreign intervention\r\ndismayed the revolutionists. On the banks of the Mondego the Marquis de\r\nChaves, with 10,000 rebels, still commanded the approach to Coimbra. On\r\nJanuary 9, a drawn battle was fought with 7,000 constitutional troops under\r\nSaldanha. Next morning Dom Miguel's followers, on the news of an\r\napproaching British column, quitted the field and dispersed. The Spanish\r\ntroops on the frontier disarmed those that crossed into Spain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissatisfaction in France]\r\n\r\nIn France, the government of Charles X., after some violent attacks in the\r\nChambers, recalled the Swiss brigade sent to protect the royal family in\r\nMadrid. There was trouble enough at home. The clerical reaction in France\r\nbrought about a popular outcry against the order of the Jesuits. On the\r\noccasion of a royal military review on April 29, some of the companies of\r\nthe National Guards shared in demonstrations against them. \"I am here,\"\r\nsaid the King, \"to receive your homage, not your murmurings.\" The entire\r\nNational Guard of Paris was disbanded by royal ordinance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians invade Persia]\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring the Russian forces under Paskievitch had crossed the\r\nAraxes and forced the defiles of the Persian frontier. By a rapid flank\r\nmovement an army of 10,000 Persians was detached and brought to surrender.\r\nErivan, the bulwark of Persia, was taken by assault. The triumphant Russian\r\ncolumn entered Pauris, the second city of the kingdom. Thence an advance\r\nwas made on Teheran.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intervention in Greece favored]\r\n\r\nThese easy victories in Persia left the Czar free to resume his threatening\r\nattitude toward Turkey. In this he received the hearty support of Canning.\r\nA protocol at St. Petersburg, concluded between the Duke of Wellington and\r\nNesselrode, formed the basis for Anglo-Russian intervention in the East.\r\nThe royalists of France were won over by an offer from the Greek insurgents\r\nto place the Duke of Nimours on the throne of Greece. Without giving actual\r\nsupport to the proposed intervention the French ambassador in\r\nConstantinople was instructed to act with his English and Russian\r\ncolleagues. Under the weight of this combination even Prince Metternich\r\ngave way.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Germany were calculated to excite his alarm. At Dresden the\r\naccession of Anthony Clement to the crown of Saxony met with extreme\r\ndisfavor on the part of the Saxon people by reason of Anthony's pronounced\r\nCatholicism. Soon his measures provoked a rising of the people. Anthony had\r\nto resign, and Frederick Augustus II. became regent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Hauff]\r\n\r\nIn Wurtemberg, where public affairs had taken a more liberal turn, the\r\ndeath of Wilhelm Hauff, the young author, was felt as a great loss. Hauff\r\ndied in his twenty-fifth year, while still in the first promise of his\r\nliterary activity. His stories of the Black Woods and his Oriental Tales,\r\ntogether with his medieval romance \"Lichtenstein,\" modelled after the best\r\nof Walter Scott's romances, have assured him a prominent place in German\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Laplace]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nebular hypothesis]\r\n\r\nOn March 15, Marquis Pierre Simon de Laplace, one of the greatest\r\nmathematicians and physical astronomers of all time, died at Arcueil.\r\nLaplace was born in 1749, in Normandy. Although a poor farmer's son, he\r\nsoon won the position of a teacher at the Beaumont Military School of\r\nMathematics, and later at the Ecole Militaire of Paris. One of the early\r\nnotable labors of Laplace was his investigation of planetary perturbations,\r\nand his demonstration that planetary mean motions are invariable--the first\r\nimportant step in the establishment of the stability of the solar system\r\nand one of the most brilliant achievements in celestial mechanics. In his\r\n\"Exposition du Systeme du Monde\" was formulated the theory called the\r\n\"nebular hypothesis,\" the glory of which he must share with Kant. \"He would\r\nhave completed the science of the skies,\" says Fourier, \"had the science\r\nbeen capable of completion.\" As a physicist he made discoveries that were\r\nin themselves sufficient to perpetuate his name, in specific heat,\r\ncapillary action and sound. In mathematics he furnished the modern\r\nscientist with the famous Laplace co-efficients and the potential function,\r\nthereby laying the foundation of the mathematical sciences of heat and\r\nelectricity. Not satisfied with scientific distinction, Laplace aspired to\r\npolitical honors and left a public record which is not altogether to his\r\ncredit. Of his labors as Minister of the Interior, Napoleon remarked: \"He\r\nbrought into the administration the spirit of the infinitesimals.\" Although\r\nhe owed his political success, small as it was, to Napoleon--the man whom\r\nhe had once heralded as the \"pacificator of Europe\"--he voted for his\r\ndethronement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Beethoven]\r\n\r\nShortly after the death of Laplace, Ludwig van Beethoven died in Vienna on\r\nMarch 26. The last years of his life were so clouded by his deafness and by\r\nthe distressing vagaries of his nephew that he was often on the verge of\r\nsuicide. In December, 1826, he caught a violent cold, which brought on his\r\nultimate death from pneumonia and dropsy. Beethoven, though he adhered to\r\nthe sonata form of the classic school, introduced into his compositions\r\nsuch daringly original methods that he must be regarded as the first of the\r\ngreat romantic composers. Some of his latest compositions notably, were so\r\nvery unconventional that they found no appreciation, even among musicians,\r\nuntil years after his death. Technically, his art of orchestration reached\r\nsuch a perfection of general unity and elaboration of detail that he must\r\nstand as the greatest instrumental composer of the nineteenth century. The\r\nprofound subjective note that pervades his best compositions lifts his\r\nmusic above that of his greatest predecessors: Bach, Haydn and Mozart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beethoven's career]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Notable compositions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Fidelio\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beethoven's declining years]\r\n\r\nBeethoven came of a line of musical ancestors. His grandfather and\r\nnamesake was an orchestral leader and composer of operas. His father was a\r\nprofessional singer, who took his son's musical education in hand at the\r\nage of four. At eight the boy was a fluent performer both on the violin and\r\non the piano. When but ten years old Beethoven produced his first\r\npianoforte sonata, and was installed as assistant organist in the Electoral\r\nChapel at Bonn. When the lad visited Vienna, in 1787, his extemporizations\r\non the piano made Mozart exclaim: \"He will give the world something worth\r\nlistening to.\" It was Haydn that persuaded Beethoven's patron to send the\r\nyouth to Vienna; there he became Haydn's pupil and received material\r\nsupport from Prince Lichnovsky, one of his warmest admirers. From his first\r\nentrance into the musical circles of Vienna, Beethoven was justly regarded\r\nas a highly eccentric man. His generosity of soul and transcendent genius\r\nmade all those that learned to know him condone his freaks. It was after\r\nthe opening of the Nineteenth Century that Beethoven reached his freest\r\ncreative period. Between 1800 and 1815 he composed the first six of his\r\ngreat symphonies, the music to \"Egmont,\" the best of his chamber-music\r\npieces, fourteen pianoforte sonatas, among them the \"Pastorale\" and the\r\n\"Appassionata,\" and his only opera \"Fidelio.\" This opera, which was first\r\nnamed \"Leonore,\" with an overture that was afterward abandoned, had its\r\nfirst public performance in Vienna just before Napoleon's entry into the\r\ncapital in 1805. After three representations it was withdrawn. Nearly ten\r\nyears later, after complete revision by Beethoven, \"Fidelio\" achieved its\r\nfirst great success. The great \"Heroica Symphony\" composed at the same time\r\nwas originally dedicated to Bonaparte. When Napoleon had himself proclaimed\r\nEmperor, Beethoven tore up the dedication in a rage. It was subsequently\r\nchanged \"to the memory of a great man.\" After 1815, when the composer had\r\ngrown quite deaf, his compositions, like his moods, took a gloomy cast. The\r\nextravagances of his nephew, whose guardianship he had undertaken, caused\r\nhim acute material worries. In truth he need have given himself no concern,\r\nfor his admirers, Archduke Rudolph and Princes Lobkovitz and Kinsky,\r\nsettled on him an annuity of 4,000 florins; but to the end of his days the\r\nunhappy composer believed himself on the verge of ruin. When he died, his\r\nfuneral was attended by the princes of the imperial house and all the\r\ngreatest magnates of Austria and Hungaria. Twenty thousand persons followed\r\nhis coffin to the grave.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BEETHOVEN AND HIS ADMIRERS\r\n    Painted by A. Grafle]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English officers in Greece]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Athens]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turks reject armistice]\r\n\r\nBy this time a number of foreign volunteers had flocked to Greece. Lord\r\nCochrane, an English naval officer of venturous disposition, was appointed\r\nHigh Admiral. Sir Richard Church was put in command of the Greek land\r\nforces. Early in May, Church and Cochrane sought in vain to break the line\r\nof Turks under Kiutahi Pasha pressing upon Athens. They were defeated with\r\ngreat loss, and on June 5 the Acropolis of Athens surrendered to the Turks.\r\nIn July a treaty for European intervention in Greece was signed in London.\r\nTurkey and Greece were summoned to consent to an armistice, and to accept\r\nthe mediation of the powers. All Turks were to leave Greece, and the Greeks\r\nwere to come into possession of all Turkish property within their limits on\r\npayment of an indemnity. Greece was to be made autonomous under the\r\nparamount sovereignty of the Sultan. The demand for an armistice was gladly\r\naccepted by Greece. But the Sultan rejected it with contempt. The conduct\r\nof the Turkish troops in Bulgaria caused the Bulgarians to rise and call\r\nfor Russian help.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Canning]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canning's policy]\r\n\r\nIt was at this crisis of European affairs that Canning died. His Ministry,\r\nbrief as it was, marked an epoch for England. Unlike his predecessors,\r\nGeorge Canning was called to the Ministry by a king who disliked him. What\r\nhe accomplished was done amid the peculiar embarrassments and difficulties\r\nof such a situation. On the other hand, it freed him from certain\r\nconcessions to the personal prejudices of his sovereign that hampered other\r\nMinisters. Thus he was able to introduce in Parliament his great measure\r\nfor the removal of the political disabilities of the Catholics, a reform on\r\nwhich so great a Prime Minister as the younger Pitt came to grief. Had this\r\nmeasure passed the House of Lords it would stand as the crowning act of\r\nCanning's administration. By an irony of fate the same Canning that so\r\nbitterly opposed the French Revolution and the claims of America achieved\r\nhighest fame by his latter day recognition of the rights of revolution in\r\nthe New World.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Blake]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Artist and poet]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blake's mysticism]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thomson's lines]\r\n\r\nWilliam Blake, the English poet and artist, died at Fountain Court in\r\nLondon on August 12. While Blake's poems and paintings belonged to the\r\nEighteenth Century, chronologically, the spirit of his works, with its\r\nextraordinary independence of contemporary fashions, make him a herald of\r\nthe poetic dawn of the Nineteenth Century. An engraver by profession and\r\ntraining, Blake began while still very young to apply his technical\r\nknowledge to his wholly original system of literary publication. As a poet\r\nhe was not only his own illustrator, but his own printer and publisher as\r\nwell. Beginning with the \"Poetical Sketches\" and his delightful \"Songs of\r\nInnocence,\" down to the fantastic \"Marriage of Heaven and Hell,\" all of\r\nBlake's books, with the exception of his \"Jerusalem\" and \"Milton,\" were\r\nissued during the Eighteenth Century. Blake's artistic faculties seemed to\r\nstrengthen with advancing life, but his literary powers waned. He produced\r\nfew more satisfying illustrations than those to the Book of Job, executed\r\nlate in life. His artistic work also was left comparatively untainted by\r\nthe morbid strain of mysticism that runs through his so-called \"prophetic\r\nwritings.\" The charm of Blake's poetry, as well as of his drawings, was not\r\nfully appreciated until late in the Nineteenth Century. Charles Lamb, to be\r\nsure, declared, \"I must look upon him as one of the extraordinary persons\r\nof the age,\" but his full worth was not recognized until Swinburne and\r\nRossetti took up his cause. In America, Charles Eliot Norton, at Harvard,\r\nwas Blake's ablest expounder. Famous are James Thomson's lines on William\r\nBlake:\r\n\r\n  He came to the desert of London town,\r\n    Gray miles long;\r\n  He wandered up and he wandered down,\r\n    Singing a quiet song.\r\n\r\n  He came to the desert of London town,\r\n    Mirk miles broad;\r\n  He wandered up and he wandered down,\r\n    Ever alone with God.\r\n\r\n  There were thousands and thousands of human kind,\r\n    In this desert of brick and stone;\r\n  But some were deaf and some were blind,\r\n    And he was there alone.\r\n\r\n  At length the good hour came; he died\r\n    As he had lived, alone;\r\n  He was not missed from the desert wide,\r\n    Perhaps he was found at the Throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richard Bright]\r\n\r\nIn this year Dr. Richard Bright of London published his famous \"Reports of\r\nmedical cases with a view to illustrate the symptoms and cure of diseases\r\nby a reference to morbid anatomy.\" A special feature of the book was a full\r\ndescription of Bright's discoveries in the pathology of the peculiar\r\ndisease of the kidneys which bears his name. Bright, in response to urgent\r\ndemands, lectured more fully on his great discovery before the London\r\nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delacroix]\r\n\r\nEugene Delacroix, the great exponent of French romantic art, and a pupil of\r\nGuerin, exhibited this year his \"Christ in the Garden of Olives.\" He had\r\npreviously exhibited \"Dante and Virgil,\" which created a sensation by its\r\nrich coloring. This was followed by his \"Massacre of Scio,\" \"The Death of\r\nthe Doge,\" \"Marino Faliero,\" \"Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi\" and\r\n\"Death of Sardanapalus.\" Not until some time after his death was he\r\nrecognized as the greatest early master of the French art after David. The\r\ngreat majority of his works, embracing mural paintings and pictures of\r\nimmense size, are to be found in the principal churches and galleries of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington Prime Minister]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers intervene in Greece]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greek Naval victory]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish warships stopped]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Morea ravaged]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An international demonstration]\r\n\r\nAfter the brief interregnum of Goderich's administration in England,\r\nCanning was succeeded by his rival, the Duke of Wellington. The good sense\r\nand great renown of this distinguished soldier promised strength and\r\nprestige to his administration. For a while the change of Ministry brought\r\nno avowed change in Canning's plans. Huskisson and Palmerston were retained\r\nin the Cabinet, and Canning's policy of active intervention in Greece was\r\nupheld. In consequence of the Turkish refusal of mediation, the war\r\ncontinued on both sides. The Turks got heavy reinforcements from Egypt, and\r\na strong expedition was on the point of leaving Navarino to make a descent\r\nupon Hydra, the last stronghold of the insurrection. An Anglo-French fleet\r\nunder Admirals Codrington and Regnier made a demonstration in Greek waters.\r\nThe foreign admirals exacted a promise from Ibrahim that he would make no\r\nmovement until further orders should arrive from Constantinople. An oral\r\nagreement to this effect was reached late in September. A few days later\r\nthe Greeks in free continuance of hostilities won a brilliant naval victory\r\nin the Gulf of Corinth. The hero on this occasion was Captain Hastings, an\r\nEnglish volunteer. Ibrahim was so incensed that he sailed out of Navarino\r\nand made for Patras. Codrington threw his British squadron across the\r\ntrack of the Egyptian ships and forced them to turn back by a threat to\r\nsink them. It was regretted at the time that Codrington did not compel\r\nIbrahim to take his expedition out of Greek waters back to Alexandria. As\r\nit was, Ibrahim returned to Navarino, and there found orders from the\r\nSultan to carry on the war without regard to Western intermeddling. Another\r\nTurkish column was forthwith despatched into the Morea and devastated that\r\ncountry with fire and sword. Clouds of smoke revealed to the European naval\r\nofficers how the Turks had met their proposals for peace. Admiral\r\nCodrington sent messages to Ibrahim, calling for instant cessation of\r\nhostilities, for the evacuation of the Morea, and the return of his fleet\r\nto Constantinople and Alexandria. The answer to this message was that\r\nIbrahim had marched into the Morea and could not be reached. The three\r\nsquadrons of England, Russia and France cruising off Zante immediately came\r\ntogether. They consisted of twenty-nine vessels, ten ships of the line, ten\r\nfrigates, four brigs and five schooners. United in one column, under\r\ncommand of Codrington as senior admiral, they sailed for Navarino.\r\n\r\nCodrington was unhampered by instructions. He could feel sure of the\r\nsupport of his government, however, for in his pocket was a confidential\r\nnote from the Duke of Clarence, the royal commander of the navy,\r\nencouraging him to \"find\" a quarrel with the Turkish admiral.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Navarino]\r\n\r\nOn October 20, the three squadrons sailed into Navarino harbor in battle\r\narray, and came to anchor within pistol shot of the Turkish fleet,\r\ncomposed of seventy warships, forty transports and four fire-ships,\r\nanchored under cover of the land batteries. To windward of the British\r\ncorvette \"Dartmouth\" lay a Turkish brulote or fire-ship. A gig was sent to\r\ndemand the withdrawal of this dangerous vessel. The Turks fired on the boat\r\nwith cannon-shot and musketry. When Codrington sent a boat to the Egyptian\r\nflagship, Moharem Bey, the admiral, opened with his guns. One shot struck\r\nthe \"Asia,\" Codrington's flagship, and his pilot was killed. Codrington\r\nopened with all his guns. The British broadsides soon reduced the Egyptian\r\nflagship on one side, and a Turkish man-o'-war on the other side to mere\r\nwrecks. The French and Russians joined in. The Moslem ships, which had a\r\nsuperiority of 800 guns, replied with spirit. At close range they fought\r\nthe combined fleets of their hated Christian adversaries. From the\r\nsurrounding shores 20,000 Moslem soldiers discharged their guns into the\r\nland-locked harbor. The fight lasted from three in the afternoon until\r\nseven in the evening. All bravery was in vain when pitted against Western\r\nseamanship and gunnery. In the course of a short afternoon one Turkish ship\r\nafter another was sunk or blown to pieces. By sundown little was left of\r\nthe Turkish fleet but a mass of wreckage. Only fifteen ships escaped, to be\r\nscuttled by their own sailors. Four thousand Moslem seamen lost their\r\nlives. All night long the Turkish gunners on shore kept up their fire. On\r\nthe morrow, when Ibrahim returned to Navarino, he found the waters of the\r\nharbor strewn with wreckage and the floating bodies of his sailors. One of\r\nthe best accounts of the battle of Navarino has been given by Eugène Sue,\r\nthe novelist, who then served as surgeon on one of the French vessels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greece saved]\r\n\r\nThe island of Hydra and with it all Greece was saved. The subsequent course\r\nof Sultan Mahmoud was that of blind infatuation and fury. So far from\r\naccepting the European demands for an armistice, he put forward a\r\nperemptory request for an indemnity for the losses inflicted upon him. The\r\nAmbassadors of the Powers quitted Constantinople. It was then that the loss\r\nof Canning was felt in England. Instead of pursuing the vigorous policy to\r\nwhich it stood committed by the battle of Navarino, Great Britain hung\r\nback. Further intervention, with the profits accruing therefrom, was left\r\nto Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1828\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace of Tourkmanchay]\r\n\r\nThe time for undisturbed intervention in the East was most auspicious for\r\nRussia. Peace with Persia was concluded early in the year. By the treaty of\r\nTourkmanchay, Fet Aly of Persia ceded to Russia the provinces of Erivan and\r\nNakhitchevan and paid an indemnity of 20,000,000 roubles. The river Araxes\r\nwas recognized as the frontier of both states. England's ascendency in\r\nPersia was effectually set at naught. Even in China Emperor Taouk-Wang felt\r\nencouraged to issue edicts prohibiting England's pernicious opium trade on\r\nthe Chinese coast. Russia's armies were now let loose on Turkey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Independence of Greece]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capodistrias summoned]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia's double game]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Understanding with France]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the Greeks profited by the Turkish check at Navarino to\r\nassert themselves as an independent people. On January 18, Capodistrias,\r\nthe former Prime Minister of Russia, was summoned from Geneva and made\r\npresident of the Greek republic. His term of office was to last seven\r\nyears. This eminent statesman justified his selection by immediate\r\nbeneficent measures. A grand council of state was established and a\r\nnational bank opened in Athens. With the help of France, immunity from\r\nfurther incursions from the Turks was practically assured. To preserve the\r\n_status quo_ in Greece, Russia undertook to limit its single handed war on\r\nTurkey to operations on the mainland and in the Black Sea. Within the\r\nwaters of the Mediterranean the Czar proposed to continue as an armed\r\nneutral in harmony with the other Powers under the treaty of London, and,\r\nto allay the apprehensions of Austria, the Russian forces in the Balkans\r\nwere ordered to carry their line of operations as far as possible from\r\nAustria's sphere of influence. A still more effectual check on Austria was\r\nsecured by the Czar's secret encouragement of French aspirations toward the\r\nRhine. Charles X. exposed the plot when he said: \"If the Czar attacks\r\nAustria, I will hold myself in reserve and regulate my conduct according to\r\ncircumstances. If Austria attacks, I will instantly march against her.\" As\r\nPrince Metternich put it, \"The two powers were at one: France against the\r\nEuropean _status quo_; Russia against that of the Orient.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Holy War proclaimed in Turkey]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia declares war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early success]\r\n\r\nAlthough the recent Turkish concessions to Russia left to the Czar no\r\nground for war, a pretext was supplied by Sultan Mahmoud himself. With true\r\nTurkish infatuation he chose this moment to issue a direct challenge to\r\nRussia. The Czar was denounced as the instigator of the Greek rebellion,\r\nand the arch enemy of Islam. The treaty of Akerman was declared null and\r\nvoid. A holy war was proclaimed against the Muscovites. \"The Turk does not\r\ncount his enemies. If all the unbelievers together unite against us we will\r\nenter on the war as a sacred duty, and trust to Allah for help.\" This\r\nproclamation was followed by the expulsion of all Christians from\r\nConstantinople. Unfortunately for the Sultan, his recent massacre of the\r\nJanizaries deprived him of the flower of his troops, and the reorganization\r\nof the Turkish army, which was the motive of that act, was only under way.\r\nFor seven years the Russians had been preparing for this war. Nicholas lost\r\nno time in answering the Sultan's challenge. He replied with a declaration\r\nof war on April 26. Field Marshal Wittgenstein crossed the Pruth, while\r\nPaskievitch entered Asia Minor. The Russian troops overran the Roumanian\r\nprovinces, Wallachia and Moldavia. The Danube was crossed early in June,\r\nunder the eyes of the Czar. Unable to meet their enemy in the open field,\r\nthe Turks withdrew into their strongholds, Ibraila and Silistria on the\r\nDanube, Varna and Shumla in the Balkans. The Russians besieged and stormed\r\nIbraila, and thence pushed on through the Dubrudsha toward the Black Sea.\r\nIn the meanwhile Paskievitch in Asia Minor defeated two Turkish armies and\r\ncaptured Erzeroum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brionis victorious]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surrender of Varna]\r\n\r\nAfter these early successes the Russian operations began to lag. The Czar's\r\npresence at headquarters was a source of embarrassment rather than of\r\nstrength. Wittgenstein committed the error of dividing his army into three\r\nslender columns. Too weak to conduct forward operations, they were held in\r\ncheck before Silistria, Varna and Shumla. The Russian transport service,\r\nnone too good at best, collapsed under the threefold strain. The ill-fed\r\nsoldiers wasted away by thousands. At length Homer Brionis, the commandant\r\nof Shumla, took advantage of the weakness of his besiegers. On September 24\r\nhe broke out of Shumla and marched to the relief of Varna. The Czar,\r\nnotwithstanding the evident weakness of his troops, ordered his cousin,\r\nEugene of Wurtemberg, to check the Turkish advance with a frontal attack.\r\nThe result was a severe defeat. Had Brionis marched onward Varna would have\r\nbeen relieved. He clung to Shumla, however, and the Turks at Varna were\r\nforced to surrender. It was late in autumn now, and cold weather put a stop\r\nto the campaign for the year. The display of military weakness seriously\r\ninjured the prestige of Russia. The manifold mistakes of this campaign have\r\nbeen unsparingly laid bare in a famous monograph of Moltke. Henceforth the\r\nsuccessful prosecution of the war became a _sine quâ non_ for Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turks evacuate Morea]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vacillation in France]\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of these events, French forces were landed in Greece.\r\nThey occupied Navarino, Patras and Modon. The Turks gave in and consented\r\nto evacuate the Morea. In France, the ultra-royalist measures of Charles X.\r\ngave rise to an ever growing spirit of dissatisfaction. The death of\r\nManuel, the outcast of the Chambers, was made the occasion of a great\r\npublic demonstration. The coalition of Liberals with a faction of Royalists\r\nopposed to the Ministry had a brilliant triumph. Villèle's Cabinet offered\r\nto resign. Instead of that, the King placed Martignac above him. \"You are\r\ndeserting M. Villèle,\" said the Princess Royal to the King. \"It is your\r\nfirst step downward from the throne.\" The Duc de Broglie wrote: \"Should we\r\nsucceed, after the fall of the present Ministry, in getting through the\r\nyear tranquilly, it will be a triumphant success.\" By way of concession to\r\nthe Liberals, a royal edict suppressed all the educational institutions\r\nmaintained by the Society of Jesus. The effect of this measure was offset\r\nlater in the year by renewed imprisonment and a heavy fine inflicted upon\r\nBéranger for writing political songs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South American revolutions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mitré's résumé]\r\n\r\nLatin attempts at parliamentary government in America were productive of\r\neven more discouraging results. In the Argentine Republic, the army, after\r\ndefeating the Brazilians, was led against its own government by General\r\nLavalle. The administration was overturned and President Dorrego was shot.\r\nGeneral Rosas became the leader of the Federalist forces and took the field\r\nagainst the revolutionists. In Chile, the different parties contending for\r\nthe government patched up a precarious peace which was not destined to last\r\nlong. In Colombia, the Nueva Granada of the Spaniards, Bolivar clung to the\r\ndictatorship. A new proclamation of dictatorial powers was issued by him on\r\nFebruary 10. Soon afterward an insurrection broke out against him led by\r\nPeadella. Scarcely had this uprising been quelled when an attempt was made\r\nto kill Bolivar at his seat of government. Henceforth the history of Latin\r\nAmerica degenerated into an endless series of revolutions and\r\ncounter-revolutions. The only real strength supplied to the various\r\nrepublican governments, so called, was that derived from strong personal\r\ncharacters, yielding one-man power. General Mitré, the great statesman and\r\nhistorian of South America, has drawn up this striking résumé of the fate\r\nof the foremost leaders of Spanish American revolutions. Their story is the\r\nquintessence of the subsequent turbulent career of Latin America during the\r\nNineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The gratitude of republics]\r\n\r\n\"The first revolutionists of La Paz and of Quito died on the scaffold.\r\nMiranda, the apostle of liberty, betrayed by his own people, died, alone\r\nand naked, in a dungeon. Moreno, the priest of the Argentine revolution,\r\nand the teacher of the democratic idea, died at sea, and found a grave in\r\nthe ocean. Hidalgo, the first popular leader of Mexico, was executed as a\r\ncriminal. Belgrano, the first champion of Argentine independence, who saved\r\nthe revolution, died obscurely, while civil war raged around him.\r\nO'Higgins, the hero of Chile, died in exile, as Carrera, his rival, had\r\ndone before him. Iturbide, the real liberator of Mexico, died a victim to\r\nhis own ambition. Montufar, the leader of the revolution at Quito, and his\r\ncomrade Villavicencio, the promoter of that of Cartagena, were strangled.\r\nThe first presidents of New Granada, Lozano and Torres, fell sacrifices to\r\ncolonial terrorism. Piar, who found the true base for the insurrection in\r\nColombia, was shot by Bolivar, to whom he had shown the way to victory.\r\nRivadavia, the civil genius of South America, who gave form to her\r\nrepresentative institutions, died in exile. Sucre, the conqueror of\r\nAyacucho, was murdered by his own men on a lonely road. Bolivar and San\r\nMartin died in exile.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissension in North America]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New tariff]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: North _vs._ South]\r\n\r\nIn North America, likewise, the radical issues between the Northern and\r\nSouthern States produced ever more dissensions and discord. The question of\r\nState sovereignty was prominent in the discussion of the tariff law of\r\n1828, and assumed more and more a sectional aspect. The North had grown\r\nrich and prosperous; when under free trade her energies were directed to\r\nagriculture and commerce. This was the more emphasized when, under a\r\nprotective policy, her labor and her capital were devoted to the\r\ndevelopment of manufactures. The Southern States had originally desired a\r\nprotective policy for their own supposed advantage; now they demanded free\r\ntrade for the same reason. But the North had put much money into\r\nmanufactures, and therefore demanded that Congress, which had placed her in\r\nthis position, should protect her in it. So the tariff of 1828, the highest\r\nadopted in the United States up to that time, was a more comprehensive\r\nmeasure than any which preceded it, and was adjusted throughout to\r\nencourage Northern industry. New England was largely at one on this\r\nsubject, and the Middle and Western States were practically united. Thus it\r\nbecame a question of party politics. From the tariff of 1828 dates a new\r\nera in American Federal legislation. The division between the North and the\r\nSouth began. Led by Daniel Webster, the New England States became advocates\r\nof the protective system. The question, from being a national issue, became\r\ndistinctly sectional.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Injustice to Indians]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State rights precedent]\r\n\r\nState sovereignty was the most important problem that presented itself\r\nduring John Quincy Adams's administration. The trouble with the Creek and\r\nCherokee Indians in Georgia brought this issue to the front. These tribes\r\nwere now partially civilized, and were tilling their lands in contentment.\r\nAlthough they held their lands under treaty with the United States, Georgia\r\nsought to eject them. Instead of protecting the Indians the national\r\ngovernment allowed Georgia to have its way and sent them to the Indian\r\nTerritory. Thus was an individual State permitted to act in defiance of the\r\nnational government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Industrial development]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Webster's Dictionary]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Book of Mormon\"]\r\n\r\nIn other respects, it was a year of great prosperity and progress for the\r\nUnited States. The differences with British North America in regard to\r\nboundaries and to the proposed joint settlement of Oregon were amicably\r\nsettled by arbitration. The question of indemnities arising out of the\r\ndifferences with England was likewise satisfactorily adjusted. England's\r\nrecent introduction of railroads was eagerly followed up in America. The\r\nrails of the first American steam road were laid at Baltimore. They were\r\nmade of wood covered with iron bars. At Baltimore, too, the manufacture of\r\nfire bricks was begun. Boston harbor beheld its first steamboat. The new\r\ncanal between Providence and Worcester was opened and produced an instant\r\nincrease of traffic for New England. In the other Eastern States factories\r\ngrew in number and new processes were introduced. Thus, the first varnish\r\nmade in America was produced at New York. Damask table linen was\r\nmanufactured at Pittsburg. The first straw paper was turned out at\r\nMeadville, Pennsylvania. The planing mill was introduced. The Franklin\r\nInstitute at Philadelphia awarded to Stephen Boyden of Newark the premium\r\nfor his malleable castings. Arts and literature likewise flourished. Among\r\nthe new paintings exhibited during this year in America were Inman's\r\nportrait of Halleck, Stuart's \"Jared Sparks,\" Greenough's \"Chanting\r\nCherubs,\" Dunlap's \"Calvary\" and Thomas Cole's \"Garden of Eden.\" At Boston\r\nthe first lithographic press was established. Noah Webster published his\r\ndictionary. Fenimore Cooper brought out his American romances, \"The\r\nPrairie\" and \"Red Rover,\" while Richard H. Dana published his \"Buccaneer.\"\r\nA book of singular fruition was Joseph Smith's \"Book of Mormon,\" a\r\ncorrupted version of Spaulding's \"The Manuscript Found.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heine's \"Book of Songs\"]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Wergeland in Norway published his tragedy, \"Sinclair's\r\nDeath.\" In Germany the appearance of the \"Book of Songs,\" instantly raised\r\nHeine to the foremost rank among German lyric poets. The early influence of\r\nByron was revealed by his masterly translations from \"Manfred,\" and of the\r\nopening stanzas of \"Childe Harold\" and the lines addressed to \"Inez.\" Most\r\nfelicitous was Heine's German version of Byron's famous farewell to his\r\nwife:\r\n\r\n  \"Fare thee well, and if forever,\r\n  Still forever, fare thee well.\"\r\n\r\nHeine's own lyrical pieces, now put forth in profusion, were fully equal to\r\nthose of his English prototype. The \"Book of Songs\" throughout breathed\r\nthe spirit of the poet's sad boast:\r\n\r\n  \"From my heavy sorrows\r\n  Made I these little songs....\"\r\n\r\nHeine's love songs, alone, by their subtile fusion of exquisite simplicity\r\nwith cynicism in a perverse form, won him immediate recognition outside of\r\nGermany. This in itself has never been forgiven by the Germans. Such\r\nprejudice did not deter German song composers from setting to music Heine's\r\nmelodious verses. Franz Schubert, the foremost song composer, just before\r\nhis death found inspiration in Heine's poems for his famous \"Swan Song.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Schubert]\r\n\r\nSchubert died in Vienna on the 19th of October, at the age of thirty-one.\r\nNotwithstanding his brief career and lack of systematic schooling, he was\r\none of the most prolific as well as original of German composers. His\r\nearliest extant song, \"Hagar's Lament,\" was written at the age of fourteen.\r\nSuch early master works as \"Margaret at the Spinning Wheel,\" and the\r\n\"Erl-King,\" both written for Goethe's words, mark the swift development of\r\nhis genius. During his eighteenth year, when he wrote the \"Erl-King,\" he\r\ncomposed no less than 144 songs. On one day alone he wrote eight. Besides\r\nthis he composed two operettas, three song plays, three other stage pieces,\r\nfour masses and several cantatas. In spite of his astonishing fecundity the\r\nyoung composer suffered signally from lack of recognition. His whole life\r\nwas a long-drawn battle for subsistence. All his efforts to obtain a steady\r\nincome were unavailing. Though he composed scores for no less than\r\nseventy-two of Goethe's lyrics, that great poet was indifferent to the\r\nyoung composer. Beethoven, too, gave him but reluctant recognition. Not\r\nuntil the year of his death did Schubert succeed in giving a public concert\r\nthat was a pecuniary success. He was wretchedly underpaid by his\r\npublishers, and his greatest works utterly failed of contemporary\r\nrecognition. He died in the depths of poverty. In accordance with his last\r\nrequest, Schubert was buried in the eastern graveyard at Waehring, close to\r\nthe grave of Beethoven. Schubert achieved immortal fame as the creator of\r\nthe modern lyric song. No less original were his effective transfers of the\r\nsong motive to pianoforte music, as shown in his \"Moments Musicales\" and\r\n\"Impromptus.\" Some of his symphonies, notably that in C and the \"Fragment\"\r\nin B minor, are equal to those of Beethoven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moratin]\r\n\r\nSpain lost one of her most distinguished modern playwrights by the death of\r\nNicolas Fernandez de Moratin, a pupil of Goldoni, and the author of such\r\nenduring Spanish comedies as \"El Baron,\" \"La Mogigata\" and \"El Sí de Las\r\nNiñas.\" Besides his plays, Moratin also wrote an authoritative work on the\r\n\"Origins of the Spanish Stage.\"\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year the disorders in Portugal appeared to have\r\nsubsided sufficiently to warrant the withdrawal of the British troops. Dom\r\nMiguel, the regent, promptly proclaimed himself King. After having grasped\r\nthe reins of power, one of his first measures was the dissolution of the\r\nseven ancient estates of Portugal. In Spain King Ferdinand VII., in\r\nDecember, celebrated his wedding to Maria Christina of Naples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Huskisson]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: O'Connell]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robert Peel]\r\n\r\nDomestic affairs in England at this turn furnished an all-absorbing topic.\r\nIn the Cabinet, Huskisson's strong stand on the rotten borough question,\r\nwith his desire to accord Parliamentary representation to the working\r\npeople of Birmingham, had caused his expulsion from the Duke of\r\nWellington's councils. His resignation was followed by that of the former\r\nmembers of the Canning Cabinet. Among those chosen to supply their place\r\nwas Vesey Fitzgerald, member for County Clare in Ireland. His acceptance of\r\noffice compelled him to go back to his constituents. It was then that\r\nDaniel O'Connell, the great leader of the Catholic Association in Ireland,\r\nsaw his chance to strike a blow for Catholic emancipation. Though\r\ndisqualified from sitting in the Commons as a Catholic, O'Connell ran\r\nagainst Fitzgerald. From the first Fitzgerald's cause was hopeless. The\r\ngreat landowners, to be sure, supported his cause with all their wealth and\r\ninfluence, but the small freeholders, to a man, voted against him. After a\r\nfive days' poll, Fitzgerald withdrew from the contest. The result was that\r\nthe hitherto irresistible influence of England's territorial aristocracy\r\nlay shattered. The Protestant conservatives of England were filled with\r\nconsternation. Every debate in Parliament showed that the Catholic party\r\nwas daily gaining strength, while the resistance of the government became\r\nweaker. It was clear that something must be done. At this crisis Robert\r\nPeel, hitherto the champion of the Protestant party in the House of\r\nCommons and Cabinet, became convinced of the necessity of yielding. He lost\r\nno time in imparting this conviction to the Duke of Wellington, his chief,\r\nand therewith offered his resignation. Wellington had learned a lesson from\r\nthe events that followed Huskisson's withdrawal. He refused to let Peel go.\r\nReluctantly he became a party to Peel's change of views. As late as\r\nDecember 11, Wellington wrote a letter to the Catholic primate of Ireland,\r\ndeferring all hope of Catholic emancipation to the distant future. Before\r\nthe year closed, however, Wellington, armed with the arguments of Peel,\r\nwrung from the King the Crown's consent to concede Catholic emancipation\r\nwithout delay. Peel, as the author of this radical measure, consented to\r\ntake charge of the bill in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1829\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington's change of front]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of Parliament in England, the concessions of the government\r\nin regard to Catholic emancipation were revealed in the royal speech,\r\ndelivered by commission. The great Tory party, thus taken unawares, was\r\nfurious. The Protestant clergy opposed the bill with all their influence\r\nand clamored for a dissolution of Parliament. In the excited state of\r\npublic feeling, an immediate appeal to the country would undoubtedly have\r\nwrecked the bill. Unable to carry out such a plan, the Tory opposition\r\nshowed itself ready to unite with any party in order to defeat the measure\r\nand wreak vengeance on its framers. Within the Cabinet itself, Wellington's\r\nchange brought him bitter opposition. When the bill was brought into\r\nParliament in March, the Attorney-General, Sir C. Wetherell, not content\r\nwith refusing to draw the bill, sprang up to explain his position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wetherell's attack]\r\n\r\n\"Am I, then,\" he exclaimed, \"to blame for refusing to do that, in the\r\nsubordinate office of Attorney-General, which a more eminent adviser of the\r\nCrown, only two years ago, declared he would not consent to do? I dare them\r\nto attack me! I have no speech to eat up. I have not to say that a thing\r\nis black one day and white another. I would rather remain as I am, the\r\nhumble member for Plympton, than be guilty of such treachery, such\r\ncontradiction, such unexplained conversion, such miserable and contemptible\r\napostasy.... They might have turned me out of office, but I would not be\r\nmade such a dirty tool as to draw _that_ bill. I have therefore declined to\r\nhave anything to do with it.\" Of course, Wetherell was at once dismissed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of Peel]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emancipation of English Catholics]\r\n\r\nBut an opportunity to avenge his dismissal was soon afforded. Robert Peel,\r\nsince he was not suffered to withdraw from the Ministry, felt in honor\r\nbound to go back to his constituents at Oxford. The Protestant party that\r\nhad sent him to Parliament now opposed him with a simple country gentleman,\r\nin no wise his Parliamentary equal. Peel was crushingly defeated. On the\r\nother hand, the Whig party almost in a body went over to the government.\r\nWith their help the Catholic Emancipation act was passed. The Tories waited\r\nonly for the time to strike down their former leaders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reforms in India]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fanny Kemble]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Humphry Davy]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thomas Young]\r\n\r\nThe precarious position of Wellington's Ministry at home was offset by a\r\nfirm policy abroad. In British India the new Governor-General, Lord\r\nBentinck, upheld British prestige by his firm abolition of the native\r\ncustom of burning widows and by his extermination of the roving gangs of\r\nThugs. In regard to the Eastern Question and the war in the Balkans,\r\nEngland came to an agreement with Austria to frustrate Russia's plans with\r\nrespect to Constantinople. Thanks to this _entente cordiale_ between the\r\ntwo countries, enterprising English capitalists and engineers were allowed\r\nto put into operation the first line of steamboats that plied the waters of\r\nthe Danube. Among other minor events of interest to Englishmen during this\r\nyear, may be mentioned the first public appearance of Fanny Kemble, the\r\nactress, and the earliest boat race between student crews from the\r\nUniversities of Oxford and Cambridge. England lost two of her famous\r\nscientists during this year--Sir Humphry Davy and Thomas Young. Davy was\r\nborn in 1778 and died in Geneva. Besides inventing the miner's safety lamp,\r\nwith which his name will be forever associated, he made valuable\r\nexperiments in photography; discovered that the causes of chemical and\r\nelectrical attraction are identical; produced potassium and sodium by the\r\nelectric current; proved the transformation of energy into heat; formulated\r\na theory of the properties of particles of matter (or atoms); and made\r\nremarkable experiments which led to the theory of the binary composition of\r\nchemical compounds. Young was born in 1773. At Cambridge they called him\r\n\"Phenomenon Young,\" because he was said to know everything. In truth, Young\r\ndeveloped into the most profound English scientist of the century. When\r\nonly twenty he was asked to read papers before the Royal Society. In 1801\r\nhe delivered the Bakerian lecture, his subject being \"The Theory of Light\r\nand Colors.\" That lecture marks an epoch in physical science; for it\r\nbrought forward for the first time convincing proof of the correctness of\r\nthe undulatory theory of light. The intangible substance which pulsates\r\nand undulates to produce light, Young christened the \"luminiferous ether.\"\r\nAnd the term is still to be found in our scientific vocabulary.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AMERICAN INVENTORS\r\n    Painted by C.

The winter\r\nmonths had been spent in bringing up reserves. The Czar withdrew from\r\ninterference at headquarters, and Wittgenstein was superseded by General\r\nDiebitsch, a trained Prussian soldier. This general made preparations to\r\ncross the Balkans as soon as Silistria should have fallen, without waiting\r\nfor the fall of Shumla. On the other side of the Balkans the Russian fleet\r\nmade a diversion so as to prepare the way for joining forces on the banks\r\nof the Black Sea. In accordance with these plans Diebitsch sent a strong\r\nforce against Silistria. Before anything had been effected in front of\r\nSilistria, Reshid Pasha, the Turkish Grand Vizier, moved eastward from\r\nShumla and took the field against the weak Russian forces at Varna. He lost\r\ntime, however, and suffered himself to be held at bay by the Russians.\r\nDiebitsch hurried across Bulgaria in forced marches. Coming up in Reshid's\r\nrear he could either fall upon Shumla or force the Turks to open battle. He\r\nchose the latter course. The Turks, harried in their rear, attempted to\r\nregain the roads to Shumla. On June 10, the two forces met in a pitched\r\nbattle at Kulevtcha. Reshid was badly defeated, losing 5,000 men and\r\nforty-three guns, but made good his retreat to Shumla. Diebitsch had to lay\r\nsiege to Shumla. Soon after this, Silistria fell into the hands of the\r\nRussians. Turning Varna over to the Bulgarians, and leaving a blockading\r\nforce before Shumla, Diebitsch boldly crossed the Balkans. The resistance\r\nof the Turks was weak. On August 19, the Russians appeared before\r\nAdrianople. In the Black Sea the Russian frigate \"Mercury\" defeated two\r\nTurkish men-of-war. The Turks were seized with terror. Adrianople\r\nsurrendered without a blow. In the Morea the Turks evacuated Tripolitza and\r\nMissolonghi and acknowledged the independence of Greece. The ports of the\r\nBlack Sea, almost as far south as the Bosphorus, fell into Russian hands.\r\nFlying columns of the Russian army penetrated down to the Ægean coast and\r\nas far as the Euxine. Yet the Russians were so weak in numbers that\r\nanything like determined resistance could easily have checked them. As it\r\nwas, all Turkish resistance collapsed before the Russian onward march\r\ntoward Constantinople. The Sultan appealed to the Powers for help. England\r\nand Austria intervened, and peace was forced upon Russia. The treaty of\r\nAdrianople, signed on September 14, confirmed to Russia its protectorate\r\nover the Danubian principalities. No Mussulman was to be permitted to stay\r\nwithin the principalities, and all Turkish lands were to be sold within\r\neighteen months. No fortified point on the left bank of the Danube was left\r\nto Turkey. Territory in Asia was ceded to Russia, as well as the ports of\r\nPoti and Anapa on the Black Sea. The waters of this sea were thrown open to\r\ninternational navigation; and the straits of Constantinople and the\r\nDardanelles were declared open to the merchant ships of all powers at\r\npeace with the Porte. The payment of a money indemnity of 2,000,000 roubles\r\nto Russia was deferred, thus leaving to Russia the means for exerting\r\npressure on the Yildiz Kiosk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French ambitions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polignac Prime Minister]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liberal opposition]\r\n\r\nRussia's acceptance of foreign mediation at Adrianople brought\r\ndisappointment to France. Reverting to Napoleonic ambitions, King Charles's\r\nMinisters had proposed a partition of the Ottoman Empire on the basis of a\r\ngeneral rearrangement of Europe. Russia was to have the Danubian provinces\r\nnear the Austrian empire, Bosnia and Servia; Prussia was to have Saxony and\r\nHolland; Belgium and the Rhine provinces were to fall to France, and the\r\nKing of Holland was to be installed in the Sultan's divan at\r\nConstantinople. It was a chimerical project which it was hoped might avert\r\nthe impending troubles at home by dazzling acquisitions abroad. A\r\nformidable majority had been raised up against the government by its\r\npersistent encroachments upon the freedom of speech and of the press.\r\nMartignac's Ministry resigned and Prince Polignac, a crony of the King, was\r\nput in his place. In August, the \"Journal des Débats\" thundered against\r\nhim: \"Now again is broken that bond of love and confidence which joined the\r\npeople to the monarch. The people pay a million of taxes to the law; they\r\nwill not pay two millions on the orders of the Minister. What will he do\r\nthen? Will he bring to his assistance the force of the bayonet? Bayonets in\r\nthese days have become intelligent. They know how to defend the law.\r\nUnhappy France, unhappy King!\" The Bertins were prosecuted for that\r\narticle and condemned. It only made matters worse. Societies were formed\r\nthroughout France to refuse the payment of taxes should the government\r\nattempt to raise them without the consent of the Chambers. In the face of\r\nthis growing popular opposition, the King and his Minister resolved to\r\nprepare an expedition against Algiers. As Guizot put it, \"They hope to get\r\nrid of their difficulties through conquest abroad and a resulting majority\r\nat home.\" The death of Paul Barras about this time served to revive\r\nrevolutionary memories in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Schlegels]\r\n\r\nThe memory of Madame de Staël and her struggle for freedom of speech and of\r\nliterary opinion against Napoleon were recalled by the death of her\r\nlong-time friend and biographer, Karl Friedrich Wilhelm von Schlegel,\r\nbrother of August Wilhelm, the German poet. Karl studied at Göttingen and\r\nLeipzig, devoting most of his time to the classics. It was his ideal to\r\nbecome the \"Winckelmann of Greek Literature.\" Schlegel's first publication\r\nwas \"Greeks and Romans.\" In 1798 he wrote \"Lucinda,\" an unfinished romance,\r\nand \"Alarcos,\" a tragedy. In 1803 he joined the Roman Church, and several\r\nyears later was appointed an imperial secretary at Vienna. He served as\r\nConsul of Legation for Austria in the German Diet at Frankfort. Besides his\r\npublished lectures, Schlegel's chief works are: \"History of the Old and New\r\nLiterature\" (1815), \"Philosophies of Life\" (1828), \"Philosophy of History\"\r\n(1829), and the posthumous work \"Philosophy of Language.\" His wife, a\r\ndaughter of Moses Mendelssohn, was the author of several works published\r\nunder Schlegel's name. During the same year Pope Leo XII. died at Rome and\r\nwas succeeded by Pius VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Andrew Jackson inaugurated]\r\n\r\nIn the United States of North America, John Quincy Adams was succeeded by\r\nAndrew Jackson. Calhoun was re-elected Vice-President. A motley crowd of\r\nbackwoodsmen and mountaineers, who had supported Jackson, crushed into the\r\nWhite House shouting for \"Old Hickory.\" For the first time the outgoing\r\nPresident absented himself from the inauguration of his successor. He had\r\nremained at his desk until midnight of the previous day signing\r\nappointments which would deprive Jackson of so much more patronage. Jackson\r\ntook his revenge by the instant removal of 167 political opponents. His\r\nremark, \"To the victor belong the spoils,\" became a byword of American\r\npolitics. The system of rotation in office dates from his administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Kitchen Cabinet\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Pocket Vetoes\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peggy O'Neill]\r\n\r\nJackson's first Cabinet was headed by Van Buren, with Samuel D. Ingham for\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. The President also encouraged a set of\r\nconfidential advisers, among whom Kendall, Lewis and Hill were the most\r\ninfluential. They came to be known as the \"Kitchen Cabinet.\" The regular\r\nmembers of the Cabinet were treated as mere head clerks. In one week\r\nJackson vetoed more bills than any of his predecessors had done in four\r\nyears. Other bills he held back until after the adjournment of Congress,\r\nand then failed to sign them. The bills remained, as it were, in the\r\nPresident's pocket. This new method of vetoing became notorious as the\r\n\"Pocket Veto.\" In other respects Jackson's first administration was stormy.\r\nInternational relations were repeatedly threatened by the long-standing\r\ncontroversy over the indemnity for French spoliations. An adjustment of the\r\nindemnity claims with Denmark was likewise forced to an issue. At home,\r\nJackson's abandonment of the principle of extreme protection and his\r\nhostility to the United States Bank lost him the support of the loose\r\nconstructionists. As a Freemason, the President was likewise opposed by the\r\nnew anti-Masonic party in politics. In a quarrel over the character of the\r\nwife of Secretary Eaton, the beautiful Peggy O'Neill, all Washington was\r\ninvolved. It was commonly believed that the subsequent break-up of\r\nJackson's Cabinet was caused by the social bickerings among the wives of\r\nthe members. Van Buren was the first to resign. Soon he was appointed\r\nMinister to England, but the Senate rejected him through the vote of\r\nVice-President Calhoun. Jackson afterward took his revenge by defeating\r\nCalhoun's aspirations to the Presidency through Van Buren. The new Cabinet\r\nconsisted of Livingston, McLean, Cass, Woodbury, Tracy and Berry. By reason\r\nof the new protective tariff, the States of Georgia and South Carolina,\r\ntoward the close of 1829, returning to the Kentucky Resolutions of 1799,\r\naffirmed the right of any State to declare null and void any act of\r\nCongress which the State Legislature deemed unconstitutional. This was the\r\ndoctrine of nullification which grew to secession in 1860.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American development]\r\n\r\nThe industrial progress of the United States was little affected by the\r\npolitical dissensions during Jackson's first Presidential year. On July 4,\r\nthe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was opened. The first trip of an American\r\nlocomotive was made on the Carbondale and Honesdale road. Throughout the\r\ncountry many canals were opened; to wit, the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal,\r\nthe Delaware and Hudson, and the Oswego in New York; the Farmington in\r\nConnecticut, and the Cumberland and Oxford Canal in Maine. Among the\r\nliterary productions of the year were a collection of minor poems by Edgar\r\nAllan Poe, Parkman's earlier essays, Cooper's \"Wept of the Wish-ton-Wish,\"\r\nSparks's \"John Ledyard,\" and Washington Irving's \"Granada.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early automobile vehicles]\r\n\r\nIn England the first successful experiments with steam-propelled stage\r\ncoaches were made by Sir Goldsworth Gurney. These machines were the\r\nprecursors of the latter-day automobile vehicle. This account of a ride in\r\nthe Gurney stage coach was published by the \"United Service Journal\":\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A contemporary description]\r\n\r\n\"We numbered four in a coach attached to the steam carriage, and we had\r\ntravelled without difficulty or mishap as far as Longford, where they were\r\nrepairing the bridge over the Cambria. On this was a large pile of bricks,\r\nso high as to conceal what was happening on the other side. Precisely at\r\nthe moment we began to cross the bridge the mail-coach from Bath arrived on\r\nthe other end. As soon as we perceived it we shouted to the driver to take\r\ncare; but, as he was not aware of the extraordinary vehicle he was going\r\nto meet, he did not slacken speed. To avoid a collision, Mr. Gurney guided\r\nour steam carriage into the pile of bricks. Some damage to our apparatus\r\nresulted, but was repaired in less than a quarter of an hour. As to the\r\nhorses of the coach, they had taken the bit between their teeth and had to\r\nbe cut loose.\r\n\r\n\"Upon our arrival at Melksham, we found that there was a fair in progress,\r\nand the streets were full of people. Mr. Gurney made the carriages travel\r\nas slowly as possible, in order to injure no one. Unfortunately, in that\r\ntown the lower classes are strongly opposed to the new method of\r\ntransportation. Excited by the postilions, who imagined that the adoption\r\nof Mr. Gurney's steam carriage would compromise their means of livelihood,\r\nthe multitude that encumbered the streets arose against us, heaped us with\r\ninsults, and attacked us with stones. The chief engineer and another man\r\nwere seriously injured. Mr. Gurney feared we could not pursue our journey,\r\nas two of his best mechanics had need of surgical aid. He turned the\r\ncarriage into the court of a brewer named Ales, and during the night it was\r\nguarded by constables.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jobard]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jobard's impressions]\r\n\r\nTo have assisted at the experiment of Gurney's steam carriage was, in those\r\ndays, almost a title to glory. These carriages became speedily one of the\r\ncuriosities of London. Foreign travellers who printed accounts of their\r\njourneys, did not fail to devote a chapter to the new means of locomotion.\r\nJobard, the Belgian savant and economist, was of the number, and so were\r\nCuchette, St. Germain Leduc and C.G. Simon, three prominent scientific\r\nwriters of that time. Jobard's impressions noted down at the time are\r\nworthy of record: \"My first visit in England was to the starting station of\r\nSir Goldsworth Gurney's steam omnibus, running between London and Bath.\r\nThis carriage does not differ materially from other stage-coaches, nor has\r\nit had any serious mishap as yet. For my benefit it manoeuvred back and\r\nforth over the street pavement and later on the smooth macadam of the\r\nhighway, without any apparent difficulties of guiding. The drivers of other\r\nstage-coaches are agreed that the thing is a success, and that before long\r\nit will do them much harm.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lamarck]\r\n\r\nJean Baptiste de Lamarck, a forerunner of Charles Darwin died in this year.\r\nAs early as 1801 Lamarck had outlined his ideas of the transmutation of\r\nspecies and attempted to explain the manner in which that transmutation had\r\nbeen brought about. There is no such thing as a \"species,\" he held; there\r\nare only individuals descended from a common stock and modified in\r\nstructure to suit their environment. Lamarck was scoffed at in his own\r\ntime; he was respected as a naturalist, but unrecognized as a prophet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1830\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First sewing machine]\r\n\r\nEarly in the year, Bartholemy Thimonnier, a French tailor, took out a\r\npatent for his invention of a sewing machine. It was an invention destined\r\nto revolutionize the manufacture of clothing and the matter of dress in all\r\ncivilized countries. Thimonnier's device was a chain stitch sewing machine\r\nworked with a treadle. It had taken the inventor, ignorant as he was of\r\nmechanics, four years of painful application to perfect it. The first to\r\nrecognize the real value of the invention was M. Beunier, supervisor of\r\nmines at Paris. He took Thimonnier to Paris and installed him as a partner\r\nand manager of a large clothing firm that manufactured army uniforms. They\r\nset up eighty machines and did so well with them that the workmen of Paris,\r\nprofiting by the revolutionary disturbances of the times, wreaked their\r\nvengeance on the new labor-saving device by wrecking the establishment. The\r\ninventor was compelled to flee for life. During the same year, another\r\nFrenchman, Charles Barbier, invented the system of raised printing for the\r\nblind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Thomas Lawrence]\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Lawrence, the celebrated English portrait painter, died at the\r\noutset of the year. In his early youth at Bristol and Oxford, this artist\r\nshowed marked talent for portraiture, and became a pupil of Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds at the Royal Academy. His delicate pastel portraits obtained great\r\nvogue in the most aristocratic circles of London. On the death of his\r\nmaster, Lawrence was appointed painter to the King. He became the\r\nfashionable portrait painter of the age. As such, Lawrence was summoned to\r\nAix-la-Chapelle during the International Congress of 1818 to paint the\r\nvarious dignitaries of the Holy Alliance. While at Vienna he painted the\r\nfamous pastel of Napoleon's son, the little King of Rome--by all odds the\r\nmost charming of all the many likenesses of that unfortunate eaglet.\r\nLawrence returned to England a few days after the death of Benjamin West,\r\nand was immediately elected to succeed him as President of the Royal\r\nAcademy. He held this office for ten years, until his death. Among the most\r\nnoted works of Lawrence, executed during this time, were the portraits of\r\nMaster Lambton and of the Duke of Wellington. Lawrence's ambitious essays\r\nbeyond the limits of portrait painting, such as his once celebrated\r\n\"Satan,\" obtained no lasting success. After the artist's death a number of\r\nhis best known canvases were collected for permanent exhibition in the\r\nWaterloo Gallery of Windsor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lister's microscope]\r\n\r\nIn this year Joseph Jackson Lister, an English amateur optician,\r\ncontributed to the Royal Society the famous paper detailing his recent\r\nexperiments with the compound microscope. Aided by Tully, a celebrated\r\noptician, Lister succeeded in making of the microscope a practical\r\nscientific implement rather than a toy. With the help of his own\r\ninstrument Lister was able to settle the long mooted question as to the\r\ntrue form of the red corpuscles of the human blood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conquest of Algiers]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: England's vain protest]\r\n\r\nIn the face of the menacing attitude of the liberal elements of France,\r\nwhich had been rendered more acute by the King's increase of the Chamber of\r\nPeers to the detriment of the Deputies, the French Government launched\r\nforth upon the conquest of Algiers. It was believed to be an auspicious\r\nmoment. The Sultan's reluctant acknowledgment of the independence of\r\nGreece, April 25, showed how powerless he was. The Dey of Algiers had\r\ninsulted France by his discourteous treatment of a French consul. He\r\nrefused the satisfaction demanded by France. On the failure of a blockade\r\nto reduce the city of Algiers, an expedition commanded by Bourmont set out\r\nfor Africa in spring. A landing was successfully effected by the middle of\r\nJune. Early in July, Algiers was taken. Immense spoils, valued at\r\n48,000,000 francs, were seized by the French. England grew apprehensive.\r\nGeorge IV. had just died (June 26), and the Duke of Wellington, who was\r\nretained in power by the new king, William IV., demanded from the French\r\nGovernment an engagement to retain none of its new conquests. \"Never,\" said\r\nLord Alverdon to Lavel, the French Ambassador, \"never did France, under the\r\nRepublic or under the Empire, give England such serious ground of complaint\r\nas she has been giving us for the last year.\" It was in vain. The seething\r\nspirit of the people in France seemed to demand an outlet. The victories\r\nof French arms in Africa were cast before the French people as a sop. The\r\npermanent annexation of Algiers was announced. It was too late.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Hernani\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Théophile Gautier]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Honoré de Balzac]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Government outvoted]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles Xth's Coup d'État]\r\n\r\nThe heated spirit of the rising generation had already been revealed in the\r\nhysterical demonstrations that occurred on the occasion of the first\r\nperformance of Victor Hugo's \"Hernani\" on February 25. Conspicuous among\r\nthe leaders of the literary tumult was Théophile Gautier, then a youth of\r\neighteen, but already an author and an _Hugolâtre intransigeant_, who led\r\nthe claque on this first night resplendent in a rose-colored doublet and\r\nstreaming long hair. With him was young Balzac, who had just won renown and\r\nnotoriety by his \"Physiologie du Mariage,\" and the first of his \"Contes\r\nDrôlatiques.\" In March, the Liberals in the Chambers declared their want of\r\nconfidence in the government by a majority of forty votes. Charles X.,\r\nstaking all on the success of his Algerian campaign, dissolved the\r\nChambers. \"No compromise, no surrender,\" was the motto of the Royalists as\r\nthey appealed to the people. The result was an overwhelming majority\r\nagainst the government. No less than 202 deputies pledged to opposition\r\nwere elected. The whole of France was now waiting for the _coup d'état_,\r\nand Europe waited with France. \"Your two weakest points are the electoral\r\nlaw and the liberty of the press,\" said Metternich to the French Ambassador\r\nin Vienna, \"but you cannot touch them except through the Chambers. A _coup\r\nd'état_ would ruin the dynasty.\" The Czar, in St. Petersburg, spoke in a\r\nlike strain to the Duc de Mortemart. Charles X. could not be restrained.\r\n\"There are only Lafayette and I who have not changed since 1789,\" said the\r\nKing. On July 24, a Sunday, after attending mass, Charles X. signed the\r\norders that were to rid him of his Chambers. All his Ministers signed with\r\nhim. \"For life and for death, gentlemen,\" said the King. \"Count upon me as\r\nI count upon you.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thiers]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marmont]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The July revolution]\r\n\r\nThe Orders in Council appeared in the \"Moniteur\" the next day. It was said\r\nthat Sauvo, the editor of the \"Moniteur,\" as he gave the order to go to\r\npress, exclaimed: \"God protect the King.\" The publication of the edict\r\ncaused an instant extraordinary fall in stocks. Thiers thundered against it\r\nin the \"Journal des Débats.\" Government troops seized the printing presses\r\nof the leading journals. Murmuring crowds gathered on the streets. The King\r\nappointed Marshal Marmont commandant of Paris. It was the last stroke, for\r\nMarmont was popularly execrated as the betrayer of Napoleon. The National\r\nGuards brought forth their old tricolor cockades of the Revolution and the\r\nEmpire. Though military patrols tramped the streets, the night passed\r\nquietly. Next morning all work stopped, and the people fell to building\r\nbarricades. Whole streets were torn up. The pupils of the Polytechnic\r\nSchool broke open the gates and the tricolor flag floated on the towers of\r\nNotre Dame. Marshal Marmont reported to the King: \"Sire, it is no longer a\r\nriot, but a revolution. There is urgent need for your Majesty to take means\r\nof pacification. Thus the honor of the Crown may yet be saved. To-morrow\r\nit will be too late.\" The King's answer was to declare Paris under a state\r\nof siege. The so-called \"Great Week,\" or \"three days' revolution,\" had\r\nbegun. The bourgeoisie or middle class and all the students joined the\r\nrevolt. Before nightfall 600 barricades blocked the streets of Paris. Every\r\nhouse became a fortress. \"Where do the rebels get their powder?\" asked the\r\nKing in astonishment. \"From the soldiers,\" was the curt reply of the\r\nProcureur-General.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles X. obstinate]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An interim republic]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duke of Orleans summoned]\r\n\r\nIn the evening the Hôtel de Ville was captured. That evening the Ministers\r\ntried to enlighten the King, but he only replied: \"Let the insurgents lay\r\ndown their arms.\" While the discharges of artillery shook the windows of\r\nthe palace the King played whist. Next day two line regiments openly joined\r\nthe revolt. The Louvre was stormed. Still the King at St. Cloud would not\r\nyield. \"They exaggerate the danger,\" said he. \"I know what concessions\r\nwould lead to. I have no wish to ride like my brother on a cart.\" Instead\r\nof concessions he vested the command in the Dauphin, having grown\r\nsuspicious of Marmont. The mob sacked the Tuileries and hoisted the\r\ntricolor flag on the clock tower. At the Hôtel de Ville a municipal\r\ncommission was installed, composed of Lafayette, Casimir Périer, General\r\nLobau and Audry de Puyraveau. At last, when it was too late, the King\r\ncountermanded his obnoxious orders and dismissed Polignac with his\r\nMinistry. The people no longer paid attention to the King's acts. He was\r\ndeclared deposed. A republic was proclaimed and its presidency offered to\r\nLafayette. But the old hero declined the honor. With Thiers he threw his\r\ninfluence in favor of the Duke of Orleans. The Duke of Orleans, the son of\r\nPhilip Egalité, of Revolutionary fame, was invited to Paris to exercise the\r\nfunctions of lieutenant-general of the kingdom. The deposed King at St.\r\nCloud hastened to confirm the appointment. The Duke of Orleans respectfully\r\ndeclined the royal appointment. \"You cannot receive things from everybody,\"\r\nsaid Dupont. General Lafayette soon came to pay his respects. \"You know,\"\r\nsaid he, \"that I am a republican, and consider the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States as the most perfect that has been devised.\" \"So do I,\"\r\nreplied the Duke; \"but do you think that in the present condition of France\r\nit would be advisable for us to adopt it?\" \"No,\" answered Lafayette; \"what\r\nthe French people must now have is a popular throne, surrounded by\r\nrepublican institutions.\" \"That is just my opinion,\" said Prince Louis\r\nPhilippe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles X. abdicates]\r\n\r\nLafayette's conversation with the prince led to the so-called programme of\r\nthe Hôtel de Ville. \"I shall not take the crown,\" said the Duke of Orleans,\r\n\"I shall receive it from the people on the conditions it suits them to\r\nimpose. A charter will henceforth be a reality.\" At last Charles X.\r\nabdicated in favor of his grandson, the Duke of Bordeaux. The Duke of\r\nOrleans refused to recognize the claims of Henri V., and France and Europe\r\nwere with him. Charles X. relinquished further hopes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Philippe, King of France]\r\n\r\nThe Dauphin, formerly Duke of Angoulême, in like manner resigned his rights\r\nto his nephew. The act was signed on the 2d of August. Charles X. now set\r\nout for Normandy with his guards, commanded by Marmont, and, on August 16,\r\nembarked at Cherbourg in two American vessels, with the Dauphin and\r\nDauphiness, the Duchess of Berry, the Duke of Bordeaux, and a numerous\r\nsuite of attendants. The ships sailed for England, and, anchoring at\r\nSpithead, the royal fugitives took up their residence at Lulworth Castle,\r\nin Dorsetshire, but eventually removed to Holyrood Castle at Edinburgh,\r\nwhich was placed at their disposal by the British Government. On August 9,\r\nLouis Philippe, on the formal request of the two Chambers, accepted the\r\ncrown of France with a solemn oath to uphold the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Philippe's previous career]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sojourn in America]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Le Roi Citoyen\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A new power in France]\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the Bourbons was not a revolution in the sense of the\r\ngreat French Revolution of the previous century. It resulted chiefly in the\r\ntransfer of government from one political faction to another. Louis\r\nPhilippe, raised to the throne by reason of his supposed democratic\r\nprinciples, rather than for his royal lineage, was a Republican only in\r\nname. His early education, together with that of his brothers, was directed\r\nby the Countess of Genlis. On the outbreak of the Revolutionary war, the\r\nyoung Prince, then Duke of Chartres, fought with distinction by the side of\r\nKellermann and Dumouriez at Valmy and Jemmapes. He accompanied the latter\r\nwhen he took refuge in the camp of the imperialists in April, 1793. After\r\nthe death of his father, Philippe Egalité, refusing to bear arms against\r\nFrance, he joined his sister and Madame de Genlis in Switzerland, where\r\nthey lived for some time under an assumed name. In 1795 he travelled into\r\nthe north of Germany, Sweden and Norway, and in the following year sailed\r\nfrom Hamburg for the United States of America. Here he was joined by his\r\ntwo brothers, and after some years in America, during which they were often\r\nin distress, the three princes went to England in 1800. The Duke of Orleans\r\nnow obtained a reconciliation with the heads of his family, Louis XVIII.\r\nand the Count of Artois. Subsequently he became a guest at the court of\r\nFerdinand IV., the dispossessed King of Naples, at Palermo; and here was\r\ncelebrated, in November, 1809, his marriage with the Princess Marie Amelie,\r\ndaughter of that monarch. Upon the restoration of Louis XVIII. he\r\nre-entered France, and took his seat in the Chamber of Peers; but having\r\nfallen under suspicion of disaffection, he once more retired to England and\r\ndid not reappear in France till 1817. During the remainder of the reign of\r\nLouis he took no part in public affairs and lived in tranquillity at his\r\nfavorite villa of Neuilly. He was a \"citizen king,\" only in so far as he\r\nsent his children to the public schools and walked about the streets of\r\nParis with an umbrella under his arm. The most lasting effect in France of\r\nthe July revolution was the obliteration of clerical influences in the\r\nadministration and public education. The Royalist nobility likewise lost\r\nwhat political ascendency they had regained during the Restoration.\r\nHenceforth the party in power was that of the bourgeoisie or great middle\r\nclass of France, of which Louis Philippe himself was the self-constituted\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Belgium]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bombardment of Antwerp]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Talleyrand's last mission]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Belgian Independence recognized]\r\n\r\nOutside of France, on the contrary, the effects of the short revolution\r\nwere far-reaching. In the Netherlands ever increasing friction between the\r\nDutch-speaking Protestants of Holland and the French Catholics of Belgium\r\nhad excited the country to the point of revolution. Recent repressive\r\nmeasures on the part of the Dutch Government made matters worse. On August\r\n25, the performance, at the Brussels Opera House, of Auber's \"La Muette di\r\nPortici,\" with its representation of a revolutionary rising in Naples, gave\r\nthe signal for revolt. From the capital the insurrection spread throughout\r\nBelgium. The King summoned the States-General to The Hague and agreed to an\r\nadministrative separation of Belgium and Holland; but the storm was not\r\nquelled. On the appearance of Dutch troops in Brussels, barricades were\r\nerected and the insurgents drove the soldiers out of the city. For several\r\ndays fighting continued in the outskirts. A provisional government declared\r\nthe independence of Belgium. Mediation by a conference in Holland was\r\nfrustrated by the bombardment of Antwerp by its Dutch garrison. The French\r\nLiberals were burning to give assistance. Austria and Russia stood ready to\r\nprevent their intervention by force of arms. Louis Philippe, while holding\r\nthe French war party in check, felt constrained to look about him for an\r\nally. In this extremity Prince Talleyrand, the old-time diplomat of the\r\nBourbons, the Republic, the Empire and the Restoration, now in his\r\neightieth year, was sent to London. He approached Wellington and the new\r\nKing with such consummate address that an understanding was soon reached\r\nwith England, which set at naught all projects of European armed\r\nintervention on behalf of the Prince of Orange. Such intervention could not\r\nhave failed to drag the French into war. Now it was agreed that the\r\nregulation of Belgian affairs should be submitted to a conference at\r\nLondon. In the interim Belgian independence was accepted in effect and\r\nhostilities ended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leopold of Coburg declines Greek crown]\r\n\r\nIn Greece, the government of Capodistrias was beset with such difficulties\r\nthat it was decided to invite some European prince to set up a\r\nconstitutional monarchy. The throne was offered to Prince Leopold of\r\nCoburg, the husband of the late Princess Charlotte of England. Leopold\r\naccepted, but when he learned that the Powers would not grant complete\r\nindependence to Greece, without restoring Ætolia, Thessaly and the fertile\r\nislands of Samos and Candia to the Sultan, he withdrew his acceptance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Poland]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War declared on Russia]\r\n\r\nPeace had scarcely been restored in the Netherlands when the spirit of\r\nrevolt, travelling northward, seized the ardent people of Poland.\r\nAlexander's recognition of home rule in Poland had given the Poles a\r\nparliament and army of their own. After the Polish conspiracies at the\r\noutset of Nicholas's reign, Alexander's successor would no longer invoke\r\nthe Polish Diet, and Russian troops and officers were sent into Poland. Of\r\ncourse this was bitterly resented. Plans for an uprising had already been\r\nmade in 1828 during the Turkish war. The example of the successful risings\r\nin Paris and Brussels now brought matters to a head. On November 29, the\r\nrevolt broke out in Warsaw. The Polish regiments of the garrison joined the\r\ninsurgents. The Russian troops, finding the odds against them, withdrew.\r\nGrandduke Constantine narrowly escaped with his life. A provisional Polish\r\nDiet was convoked. Prince Czartoryski was elected President. The Poles, in\r\nremembrance of the late Czar's kindly attitude toward them, flattered\r\nthemselves that the fruits of their revolution might be left to them.\r\nLubecki, the former chief of the Imperial Council in Poland, with two\r\nassociates, set out for St. Petersburg to voice the Polish demands for\r\nconstitutional government before the Czar. It was even proposed that\r\nconstitutional government should be conceded to those Russian provinces\r\nthat had formerly belonged to Poland. On the way to St. Petersburg the eyes\r\nof the envoys were opened as they met the formidable columns of Russian\r\ntroops marching to the Polish frontier. Forthwith, Lubecki forsook the\r\ncause of Poland. His colleagues found difficulty in obtaining a hearing\r\nfrom the Czar. When they were finally admitted to the imperial palace,\r\nNicholas gave them clearly to understand that Poland had but two\r\nalternatives, unconditional submission or complete subjugation. When this\r\nanswer reached Warsaw it was too late to swing the outside Polish provinces\r\nand Lithuania into the movement. Yet the Polish Diet, in a spirit of\r\npatriotic frenzy amounting to national suicide, passed a resolution\r\ndeclaring that the House of Romanoff had forfeited the Polish crown.\r\nFeverish preparations were made for a life and death struggle with Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt in Spain]\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Bourbons in France had once more raised the hope of the\r\nSpanish Liberals. On the other hand, King Ferdinand's abolition of the\r\nSalic law of succession in Spain, so as to assure the throne to his new\r\nwife, raised up a party of absolutists against him. His brothers, Don\r\nCarlos and Francisco, became the heads of this movement and rallied their\r\nsupporters around them, in the Basque provinces. In Portugal kindred\r\ndissensions rent the land in twain. Dom Miguel's claims to the crown were\r\ndisputed on behalf of the constitutional government by the Duke of Palermo.\r\nAcross the seas, Dom Pedro of Brazil proclaimed himself the legitimate heir\r\nto the throne of Braganza.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Bolivar]\r\n\r\nLike other South American States, Brazil was itself a prey to internal\r\ndissensions and civil strife. To put an end to the recurrent revolutions of\r\nSouth America, Simon Bolivar conceived a scheme for a Pan-American Congress\r\nto weld together all the quasi-republican governments of the Southern\r\nHemisphere and Central America. Unfortunately for this project, Bolivar's\r\nown aspirations to dictatorial rule told against him. His chief opponents\r\nwere those who were striving for a disruption of the Colombian Union. His\r\nown States, Peru and Bolivia, had already declared against him. The\r\nCongress finally voted to give Bolivar a pension of $3,000 a year on\r\ncondition that he should leave America forever. Bolivar's pride was stung\r\nto the quick. He resigned all public offices and honors, and went to\r\nCaracas to sail for England. He died at Santa Marta, on the sea-shore, on\r\nDecember 17. His last words were: \"The people send me to the tomb, but I\r\nforgive them.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bolivar's career]\r\n\r\nIn Bolivar, South America lost the most fiery of her liberators. Born at\r\nCaracas, in 1783, he was pre-eminently a child of the modern spirit\r\nengendered by the French Revolution of 1792. He saw Spain in the days of\r\nits quasi-medieval darkness, and was in Paris at the close of the great\r\nrevolution. Later he was a witness of Napoleon's coronation as King of\r\nItaly, and saw for himself the benefits of republican institutions in North\r\nAmerica. The turning-point in his career was the loss of his young wife\r\nafter two years of domestic happiness. As he said himself: \"I loved my wife\r\nso much that at her death I made a vow never again to marry. I have kept my\r\noath. Perhaps, had I not lost her, my career would have been different. I\r\nmight not, then, have been General of the Liberators. My second visit to\r\nEurope would never have been made. The ideas which I imbibed during my\r\ntravels would not have come to me, and the experience I have had, the study\r\nof the world that I have made, and of men and things--all this, which has\r\nso well served me, would never have been. Politics would never have\r\nattracted me. But the death of my wife caused the love of my country to\r\nburn in my heart, and I have followed the chariot of Mars rather than\r\nCeres' plow.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Van Diemen's Land]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extermination of natives]\r\n\r\nIn the new English penal colony of Van Diemen's Land in Australia, the\r\nTasmania of latter days, the self-assertive and domineering traits of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race were no less apparent among the convicts than among the\r\nfew free settlers. A few years before this the colonists had proclaimed\r\nthemselves independent of New South Wales and established a separate\r\ngovernment. The Van Diemen's Land Company received a grant of twenty-five\r\nthousand acres; white population increased; religious, educational and\r\ncommercial institutions were founded. The natives were all but\r\nexterminated. During this year Governor Arthur made an extraordinary\r\nattempt to settle the native problem. His idea was to catch all the\r\naborigines of the island and pen them up on the narrow neck of land known\r\nas Tasman's Peninsula. Upward of three thousand five hundred white persons,\r\nincluding three hundred soldiers, turned out for the exciting operation of\r\nclearing Van Diemen's Land by means of a cordon across the island. All\r\nseemed to be going well until the line of beaters contracted, when it was\r\nfound that the natives were in the rear, instead of in the front. The\r\nattempt proved a total failure; only two natives were captured. The total\r\ncost of the expedition amounted to £35,000. The individual measures of the\r\nsettlers against the despised natives proved more efficacious. Within a few\r\nyears, when the last of the Tasmanian aborigines were transferred from the\r\nmainland to Flinder's Island, by the instrumentality of George Augustus\r\nRobinson, it was found that but three hundred were left. The white\r\npopulation--largely of convict antecedents--by this time numbered more than\r\n15,000 persons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: North American dissensions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nullification debate]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Webster's declaration]\r\n\r\nIn North America the doctrine of nullification, newly put forth, emphasized\r\nthe growing differences between the Northern and Southern States. The great\r\ndebate between Hayne and Webster came about casually in the course of a\r\ndiscussion of the sale of public lands. The topic of nullification was\r\ndragged in by Southern speakers. Webster felt called upon to uphold the\r\ncause of the Northern States. Smarting under some of his animadversions of\r\nSouthern sloth, Hayne made a two-day speech in which he inveighed against\r\nthe spirit of the New Englanders. His own State, South Carolina, and her\r\nsister States in the South, he declared, would defend their sovereign\r\nrights, or \"perish in the last ditch.\" Webster's reply to those prophetic\r\nwords was the grandest oratorical effort of his life. He declared for the\r\ncontinued union of all the States in all their strength: \"Liberty and\r\nUnion, now and forever, one and inseparable.\" Jackson's progressive foreign\r\npolicy poured oil on the troubled waters. His repeal of the shipping acts\r\nof 1818 and 1823 brought about a resumption of direct trade with the West\r\nIndies. On October 5, Jackson was able to issue a proclamation announcing\r\nthe opening of permanent trade with all ports of the West Indies, Bermudas,\r\nBahamas, the Gulf of Mexico and South America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anglo-American treaty]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: O'Connell's State trial]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anti-reform utterances]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington unpopular]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earl Grey, Prime Minister]\r\n\r\nThis friendly treaty with America was the last satisfactory measure passed\r\nby Wellington's Ministry in England. As elsewhere in Europe the success of\r\nthe sudden revolution in Paris created a great stir, and was brought home\r\nto Englishmen all the more forcibly by the deposed king's flight to English\r\nshores. In Ireland, matters were stirred up by Daniel O'Connell, who now\r\ncommenced an agitation for the repeal of the union with England. His\r\nprosecution for treason became a State trial. O'Connell's ultimate\r\nconviction once more alienated the powerful Catholic Association of\r\nIreland. The Duke of Wellington became so prejudiced against reform that he\r\ndeclared in Parliament: \"I am not only averse to bringing forward any\r\nmeasure of this nature, but I will at once declare, so far as I am\r\nconcerned, so long as I hold any station in the government of the country,\r\nI shall always feel it my duty to resist such a measure when proposed by\r\nothers.\" After this declaration the fall of the Ministry was assured.\r\nStocks fell in London from 84 to 77 points. Abuse and obloquy were heaped\r\nupon the Ministers from every quarter. Caricatures of them were stamped\r\neven on handkerchiefs and calico aprons. The Duke was mostly represented in\r\nthe livery of an old hackney coachman, while Sir Robert Peel figured as a\r\nrat catcher. The King no longer concealed his dislike of Wellington, who in\r\nformer days had mortally offended him by his support of Admiral Cockburn,\r\nresulting in the resignation of the Prince as Lord High Admiral of England.\r\nAs soon as Parliament was reopened late in the year, a significant rebuff\r\nwas administered to the Ministry by the Crown. The King preferred to\r\ndeliver his speech in person. In the face of the Prime Minister's\r\ndeclaration against reform, Sir Harry Parnell, even before the delivery of\r\nthe King's speech, announced a bill for the revision of the civil list.\r\nParnell's motion was carried. Brougham followed this up with a motion for a\r\nreform of the rotten borough system. Rather than submit to another\r\ninevitable defeat Wellington's Ministry resigned. Earl Grey, leader of the\r\nWhig opposition, was made Prime Minister. Brougham was raised to the\r\npeerage, and accepted the post of Lord Chancellor. Palmerston was\r\nreappointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Lord Grey's appointment of six or\r\nseven of his relatives to administrative posts weakened his Ministry from\r\nthe outset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1831\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Belgian conference]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leopold, King of Belgium]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Luxemburg question]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dutch invasion of Belgium]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French counter-invasion]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign intervention]\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of Lord Palmerston, the Belgian Conference in London\r\nwas conducted to a successful issue. Early in January the representatives\r\nof the Powers signed a protocol defining the limits of Belgium and Holland\r\nand apportioning to each country its share in the national debt. The\r\nproblem of providing an acceptable government for Belgium still remained.\r\nThe Belgians themselves would have welcomed incorporation into France. With\r\nthis object in view they elected for their sovereign the Duc de Nemours,\r\nsecond son of Louis Philippe. When a proclamation to this effect was made\r\non February 3, Louis Philippe, acting under Talleyrand's advice, withheld\r\nofficial sanction. Privately he had encouraged his son's candidacy, the\r\nmore so as a Bonapartist rival, the son of Eugene Beauharnais, was in the\r\nfield. The conference at London determined not to permit Belgium thus to\r\nbecome a dependency of France. The British Government decided that it would\r\nno longer discountenance armed intervention in Belgium against French\r\nschemes of aggrandizement. Talleyrand obtained the best terms open to his\r\nsovereign by insisting on the withdrawal of the Bonapartist pretender. The\r\nselection of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, who had just been disappointed\r\nin his aspirations for the empty throne of Greece, was encouraged by France\r\non the understanding that Leopold, if elected King of Belgium, should marry\r\na daughter of Louis Philippe. Leopold was elected on June 4, and accepted\r\nthe crown only on the condition that the London Conference should modify\r\nits territorial arrangements of January. This brought up the Luxemburg\r\nquestion. Since the Paris treaty of 1814, the formidable stronghold of\r\nLuxemburg, though under the sovereignty of the King of Holland, was\r\nmaintained as the strongest border fortress of the German Confederation.\r\nNow, the Luxemburgers had made common cause with the Belgians. Leopold\r\naccordingly insisted that Luxemburg should be treated as an integral part\r\nof Belgium. The powers at London yielded to this demand sufficiently to\r\nannul the declarations of January, with the promise of a future settlement\r\nof the status of Luxemburg. On this repudiation of the recent international\r\ndeclaration in favor of the Netherlands, the King of Holland took up arms.\r\nA Dutch army of 50,000 advanced into Belgium. Leopold at once appealed to\r\nFrance for assistance. A French army marched into Belgium from the other\r\nside. The powers at London made haste to intervene. A British fleet made a\r\ndemonstration before Antwerp. Under pressure Leopold signed an agreement to\r\nraze the fortifications on the Belgian frontier. Reluctantly the King of\r\nHolland recalled his army. Under the threat of another armed coalition\r\nagainst France, Louis Philippe withdrew his forces. Outward tranquillity\r\nwas once more restored. No immediate settlement, however, was reached in\r\nregard to Luxemburg. The union of the Luxemburgers with the Belgians\r\nremained in effect, while on the other hand strong German garrisons\r\ncontinued to hold the fortifications. For years to come this remained a\r\nvexatious problem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulties in Greece]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Holocaust of Greek fleet]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mavromichalis imprisoned]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assassination of Capodistrias]\r\n\r\nAfter the restriction of the Greek frontiers by the Powers, Capodistrias'\r\ngovernment was appreciably weakened. As difficulties thickened about him,\r\nhe resorted to the restrictive measures he had become accustomed to while\r\nPrime Minister of Russia. He felt that the cause of Greece would be\r\njeopardized unless order was maintained at any cost. When the old\r\nrevolutionary leaders became turbulent, Capodistrias only put his\r\ngovernment on a firmer basis. Mavrocordato, Konduriottes and Miaulis at\r\nthis juncture waited upon the President as a committee from the opposition\r\nand demanded the withdrawal of the obnoxious measures. Capodistrias would\r\nnot yield, and the popular leaders betook themselves to Hydra. Preparations\r\nfor civil war were begun. The President sent out an expedition to suppress\r\nthem. To prevent the fleet from falling into his hands at Paros, Miaulis\r\nset fire to the \"Hellas,\" the American-built frigate, and that ship and\r\ntwenty-eight others were burned to the water's edge. Among those that were\r\nimprisoned by Capodistrias was Petro Mavromichalis, the hero of the Morea.\r\nThe Russian admiral sailed to Nauplia to intercede in his behalf, but in\r\nvain. Mavromichalis' brother and son, Constantine and George, appealed to\r\nthe President in person, but were put under arrest themselves. On October\r\n9, Constantine and George Mavromichalis fell upon Capodistrias as he was\r\ngoing to church and shot him dead. One of the assassins was killed on the\r\nspot while the other was executed later. Capodistrias' brother, Augustine,\r\nassumed charge. His government was short-lived. After a few months he\r\nsailed away with his brother's body to Corfu.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt in Bologna]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Menotti]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mazzini]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Papal legate repudiated]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime another blow for national unity was struck in Italy. On the\r\ndeath of Pius VIII., late in 1830, Gregory XVI. was elected. He had\r\nscarcely been installed in the chair of St. Peter, when a report reached\r\nhim that Bologna had revolted against papal rule. On February 3, Menotti\r\nraised the signal of revolt at Modena. He was lured into the power of the\r\nGrandduke of Modena, but the insurrection spread so rapidly throughout the\r\nnorth of Italy that the Grandduke had to fly to Austria. Menotti was\r\ncarried to Austria and there put to death. It was about this time that\r\nMazzini made his first public appearance as a revolutionist and was\r\nimprisoned. Pope Gregory sent Cardinal Benvenuti to Bologna as a legate to\r\ntreat with the rebels, but the legate was made a captive and the revolt\r\nspread southward to the papal dominions. In his extremity the Pope called\r\nupon Austria for help.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austrian intervention invoked]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude of France]\r\n\r\nAustria, whose own dominions in Italy were threatened, had every reason to\r\ngrant this request. The only obstacle was the threatening attitude of\r\nFrance. Before sending out his troops, Metternich took pains to ascertain\r\nthe immediate intentions of France. The official answer given to the\r\ninquiries of the Austrian Ambassador in Paris, was that Austrian\r\nintervention in favor of the sovereigns of Parma and Modena, who were\r\nrelated to the House of Hapsburg, might be tolerated. An extension of such\r\nintervention to the Papal States or to Piedmont would certainly constitute\r\na _casus belli_. In token of this declaration, the French Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople was instructed to make overtures for an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance to the Sultan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Metternich diplomacy]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Papal dominions invaded]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Casimir Périer's French policy]\r\n\r\nIn this crisis Metternich put forth all the powers of statesmanship at his\r\ncommand. He declared that it was better for Austria, if necessary, to\r\nperish by war than by revolution. On the instant he assured to Russia the\r\nsupport of Austria against the Poles, while he worked upon the fears of\r\nLouis Philippe by pointing to the presence of young Louis Bonaparte and his\r\nbrother with the Italian insurgents. As a last resort he could always let\r\nloose upon France Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt, now growing to\r\nmanhood at Vienna. In defiance of the French declaration, Austria advanced\r\na strong army through northern Italy into the papal dominion. The\r\ninsurrection was ruthlessly stamped out. Louis Philippe did nothing.\r\nLafayette resigned his Ministry in chagrin. He was succeeded by Casimir\r\nPérier, a constitutional statesman of modern mold. On behalf of France he\r\nput forward a double-edged demand that the Austrians should evacuate the\r\npapal dominions as soon as the papal government should reform its abuses.\r\nFor the first time in their history, Austria and the Papacy were made to\r\ndeclare for constitutional reforms. A conference at Rome agreed upon the\r\nschemes of reforms to be instituted by the Pope. Further pretext for\r\nrevolution was thus removed. In July, the last Austrian forces were\r\nwithdrawn from the Papal States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War in Poland]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early successes]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polish disasters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ostrolenka]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ravages of cholera]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Diebitsch]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil war in Poland]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paskievitch, Russian commander]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Warsaw]\r\n\r\nThe Polish struggle, during the earlier part of this year, had assumed the\r\nproportions of a national war. In February, the Russians took the\r\noffensive. General Diebitsch at the head of a column of 120,000 men marched\r\ninto Poland. In the first encounters against the Polish forces, who were\r\nled by officers who had served under Napoleon, the Russians sustained such\r\nlosses at Stoczek, Grochov and Bialolenska that Diebitsch had to call for\r\nreinforcements. The main body of the Russian army had to abandon the bank\r\nof the Vistula. Three detached corps remained stationed there. The Polish\r\ngeneral, Skrzynecki, who had succeeded Prince Radzivil in the command, then\r\ntook the offensive. He defeated the Russians under Geismas at Waver, and\r\nGeneral Rosen at Dembevilkie and Igknie, but then stopped short. In the\r\nmeanwhile a Polish expedition into Volhynia failed completely. Dvernicki\r\nwas driven back into Gallicia. Another Polish expedition sent into\r\nLithuania under Vilna likewise ended in disaster. The main body of the\r\nPoles had to cross the Prussian frontier. Only one division under Dembinski\r\nrecovered the road to Warsaw. In the interval, the Polish army under\r\nSkrzynecki fought a pitched battle on May 26 with the right wing of the\r\nRussian main army at Ostrolenka. After a severe fight the Poles had to fall\r\nback over the Narev. Cholera now broke out in both camps. General Diebitsch\r\nand Grandduke Constantine on the Russian side succumbed to the disease.\r\nDuring this breathing space for the Poles, a revolution against the\r\nprovisional government broke out in Warsaw. The streets ran with blood.\r\nCzartoryski fled in disguise. General Krukoviecki was made dictator. He\r\nshot a number of the mutineers and replaced Skrzynecki by Dembinski.\r\nPrussia and Austria turned against the Poles. The Prussian arsenals and\r\nmilitary stores at Dantzig and Koenigsberg were placed at the disposal of\r\nDiebitsch's successor, General Paskievitch. He crossed the Vistula at\r\nWarsaw and marched on the capital along the left bank. On September 6, the\r\nRussians attacked Warsaw from the side of Vola and Czyste. On the Polish\r\nside Wysocki, who had begun the revolution, and General Suvenski, who had\r\nlost a leg at Borodino, were killed. Krukoviecki offered to capitulate. The\r\nRussians demanded unconditional surrender. The Polish Diet deposed\r\nKrukoviecki and put Niemoievski in command. Paskievitch ordered a general\r\nattack on the city. The Russians stormed the ramparts and Warsaw\r\ncapitulated. \"Sire, Poland lies at your feet,\" wrote Paskievitch to the\r\nCzar. It was the truth. At Plock 20,000 Poles laid down their arms.\r\nRamarino took 15,000 into Gallicia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poland's aspirations crushed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polish patriots scatter]\r\n\r\nEmperor Nicholas made an example of Poland. All those who had borne a\r\nprominent part in the insurrection were banished to Siberia. The\r\nconstitution granted by Alexander was annulled. No more Polish Diets were\r\ntolerated. Poles in public office were superseded by Russians. The Polish\r\nsoldiers and officers were mustered into Russian ranks and distributed over\r\nwidely different points of the empire. The country was divided into Russian\r\nprovinces, and Russian systems of taxation, coinage and of administration\r\nof justice were imposed upon Poland. In Lithuania, the Polish language was\r\nbanished from the schools. The University of Vilna was suppressed.\r\nHenceforth the ancient spirit of Poland lived only in those foreign exiles\r\nwho fomented revolutionary risings in Italy, France, Austria and Germany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spirit of revolt in Germany]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liberal leaders lost]\r\n\r\nUntil the subjugation of Poland, the German governments, apprehensive of\r\nthe course that events might take, had shown moderation in meeting the\r\nliberal movements incited by the French and Polish revolution. Trouble\r\nfirst broke out in Brunswick and Hesse, the two worst-governed States of\r\nGermany. The despotic princes of Brunswick and Hesse had to resign, and\r\nreforms were instituted by their successors. In Hanover and Saxony, too,\r\nthe people had to be appeased by parliamentary concessions and an extension\r\nof the liberty of the press. In the Bavarian Palatinate, where French\r\ninstitutions and ideas prevailed, the tricolor of France and the flag of\r\nPoland were saluted side by side with the red, black and gold banner of\r\nancient Germany. After the fall of Warsaw the governments of Prussia and\r\nAustria insisted on new reactionary measures. The Diet of the German\r\nConfederation began a campaign against all liberal tendencies. German\r\nliberalism during this dark period lost some of its foremost leaders by the\r\ndeaths of Stein the statesman, Arnim the poet, Niebuhr the historian, and\r\nHegel the philosopher.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Hegel]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German emigration to America]\r\n\r\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was born in 1770 at Stuttgart. He held chairs\r\nsuccessively at the Universities of Jena, Heidelberg and Berlin. His works\r\nreached an aggregate of eighteen volumes. As a philosopher he was one of\r\nthe most brilliant exponents of modern rationalism. He reached this\r\nstandpoint by pushing to their extreme logical conclusions the\r\nphilosophical doctrines enunciated by Kant. Hegel's most lasting works\r\nproved to be his \"Phenomenology of the Mind,\" \"History of Philosophy,\" and\r\n\"Philosophy of Religion.\" At the time of Hegel's death there was a general\r\nexodus of German liberals to Switzerland, France and America.\r\n\r\nDespite a small but influential class of Americans who copied foreign\r\nmanners, the United States of America had gained something of a national\r\ncharacter in European estimation. In the New World alone, labor was deemed\r\ncompatible with gentility. The increasing facilities of traffic and\r\nmanufacture gave a tremendous impulse to the development of the country.\r\nThus a surprising number of railroads were opened in the States of New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Improvements connecting Philadelphia and\r\nPittsburg were completed at a cost of twelve million dollars. Several\r\nthousand miles were covered by canals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of the United States]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chicago founded]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Black Hawk war]\r\n\r\nThe American census of 1831 showed nearly 13,000,000 inhabitants, a\r\ndoubling of the population since the beginning of the century. An area of\r\n725,406 square miles of territory was contained in thirty-four States and\r\nthree Territories. The population spread westward, no longer in large\r\ngroups, but in small bodies of pioneers, travelling along the chief rivers.\r\nWest of the Missouri River all was still virgin soil. During this year\r\nSchoolcraft discovered the source of the Mississippi. The settlement of\r\nChicago was laid out and the first sale of lots there was held. A boundary\r\nand commercial treaty was concluded with Mexico in the spring. Later in the\r\nyear President Jackson obtained from the French Government a promise of\r\n25,000,000 francs indemnity for the spoliations on American commerce made\r\nunder Napoleon. On April 21, the so-called Black Hawk war broke out with\r\nthe Indian tribes of the Sacs and Foxes. Some 6,500 soldiers were\r\ndespatched to subdue them. In this war it so happened that Abraham Lincoln\r\nand Jefferson Davis served as captain and lieutenant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abolitionist movement]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Garrison]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nat Turner's revolt]\r\n\r\nThe issue of slavery was brought to the front early in the year. On the\r\nfirst day of January, Garrison's \"Liberator\" appeared in Boston. Garrison\r\nadvocated immediate and unconditional emancipation of the black slaves. In\r\nhis first issue he said: \"I will not retreat a single inch, and I will be\r\nheard.\" It was not long before Garrison made himself heard, and gathered\r\nabout him a few men and women as determined as himself. Among them was the\r\nyoung poet Whittier, Louis Tappan, and Lucretia Mott, the Quaker. A storm\r\nof obloquy and persecution was raised against Garrison. Social and public\r\nostracism was visited upon him and his fellow abolitionists. Garrison's\r\nefforts to free the negroes were made especially unwelcome in the South by\r\nan insurrection of blacks led by Nat Turner of South Hampton. The revolt\r\nwas speedily suppressed, and Turner with seventeen of his followers\r\nsuffered death by hanging. Turner's attempt called forth a debate of\r\nseveral weeks in the Virginia Legislature, remarkable throughout for its\r\nexposure of the evils of slavery and their bad effect on national\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Monroe]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monroe's career]\r\n\r\nOne of the foremost statesman of the day was lost to America by the death\r\nof James Monroe. He expired on July 4, the third President to die on\r\nIndependence Day. Monroe was born in Virginia in 1758. He was educated at\r\nWilliam and Mary College, studied law under Jefferson, and became a member\r\nof the Continental Congress at twenty-five. He saw his first military\r\nservice in the War of the Revolution. Appointed Minister to France in 1794\r\nhe was recalled in 1796, and was Governor of Virginia from 1799 to 1802. He\r\nthen returned to France as envoy extraordinary and helped to accomplish the\r\npurchase of Louisiana. In 1811 he was again made Governor of Virginia. He\r\nserved as Secretary of State under Madison from 1811 to 1817 and also as\r\nSecretary of War from 1814 to 1815. When the War of 1812 emptied the\r\nnational treasury he pledged his personal credit for the defence of New\r\nOrleans. In 1816 he was elected President of the United States. While\r\nserving his second term as President, Monroe sent to Congress the famous\r\nmessage against European intervention in South America, which has\r\npermanently linked his name with the doctrine of \"America for the\r\nAmericans.\" His name has been preserved likewise in Monrovia, the capital\r\nof Liberia, the negro free state in Africa, which was founded under his\r\nauspices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Reform Bill]\r\n\r\nThroughout this year in England raged the great debate over the\r\ngovernment's proposed reform of the rotten borough system. A bill to this\r\neffect was introduced by Lord Russell on March 1, immediately after the\r\nopening of Parliament. In the seven days' debate that followed the best\r\nspeakers of England took part, among them Lord Palmerston, Sir Robert Peel,\r\nDaniel O'Connell, and young Macaulay, who had only just entered Parliament.\r\nBy the opponents of the bill reform was denounced as revolution. The\r\ngovernment of the United States of North America was cited as a deterrent\r\nexample. Thus Sir Robert Peel said:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Robert Peel's speech]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: America a \"Deterrent Example\"]\r\n\r\n\"Many experiments have been tried to engraft democratical on monarchical\r\ninstitutions, but how have they succeeded? In France, in Spain, in\r\nPortugal, in the Netherlands, in every country on the face of the earth,\r\nwith the exception of the United States, has the experiment of forming a\r\npopular government, and of uniting it with monarchy, been tried; and how,\r\nI will again ask, has it succeeded? In America, the House has been told\r\nthat the most beneficent effects of a representative form of government are\r\nplainly visible. But I beg to remind the House that there is a wide\r\ndifference indeed between the circumstances of this country and of America.\r\nIn the United States the Constitution has not been in existence more than\r\nforty years. I will not say it has been deteriorating, for I wish to avoid\r\nall invidious phrases; but it has been rapidly undergoing a change from a\r\nrepublic to a mere democracy. The influence of the executive--the influence\r\nof the government--has been daily becoming less, and more power has\r\nconsequently been vested in the hands of the people. And yet, in that\r\ncountry, there is land uncultivated to an extent almost incalculable--there\r\nis no established church, no privileged orders--property exists on a very\r\ndifferent tenure from that on which it is held in this country; therefore\r\nlet not the people of England be deceived, let them not imagine, from the\r\nexample of the United States, that because democracy has succeeded and\r\ntriumphed there, it will also succeed and triumph here.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reform Bill debate]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exciting elections]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tories defeated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cobbett's state trial]\r\n\r\nAltogether seventy-one speakers joined in the debate. In the end the\r\ngovernment obtained a second reading of the bill by a bare majority of one.\r\nThe opposition had made a motion to withdraw the bill. After another\r\nprolonged debate this was carried against the government by a majority of\r\neight. Parliament was dissolved as both Houses were on the point of\r\ncarrying a motion asking the King not to consent to a dissolution. The\r\nelections which followed were turbulent in the extreme. Throughout England\r\nthe reformers raised the cry: \"The bill, the whole bill, and nothing but\r\nthe bill.\" It was then that the custom of electioneering by means of\r\nprocessions and bands of music came into vogue. When the results of the\r\nelections were announced it was found that the Tories had lost more than a\r\nhundred seats. On the other hand a few of the most prominent supporters of\r\nthe government suffered signal defeat, notably Lord Palmerston and\r\nCavendish. On the Tory side, young Gladstone, then still a student at\r\nOxford, came into notice by his warm speech against the proposed reform.\r\nParliament was reopened with another hot debate on the all-engrossing bill.\r\nIt was passed to a second reading by a strong majority of 135 votes.\r\nScarcely had this been accomplished when the government was embarrassed by\r\nWilliam Cobbett's state trial for sedition. Throughout the trial the\r\nAttorney-General treated Cobbett with marked courtesy, speaking of him as\r\n\"one of the greatest masters of the English language who had ever composed\r\nin it.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Macaulay]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commons pass Reform Bill]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rejected by the Lords]\r\n\r\nIn truth Cobbett's pure, virile, racy, Saxon style, while it delighted men\r\nof taste, was also intelligible to the humblest commoner, and accounted in\r\nsome measure for the tremendous popularity of his journal, the \"Political\r\nRegister.\" The government was unable to secure Cobbett's conviction and he\r\nwas suffered to escape punishment by a disagreement of the jury. After this\r\ninterlude the debate on the Reform Bill went on. On the second night of\r\nthe debate Thomas Babington Macaulay delivered his first reform speech.\r\nWhen he sat down he had taken rank among the best Parliamentary orators.\r\n\"Portions of the speech,\" said Sir Robert Peel, \"were as beautiful as\r\nanything I have ever heard or read. It reminded me of old times. The names\r\nof Burke, Fox and Canning during the evening were linked with that of Mr.\r\nMacaulay.\" The \"Spectator\" computed the number of speeches which were\r\ndelivered in committee between the middle and end of July at more than two\r\nhundred. Sir Robert Peel alone spoke forty-eight times, while Wetherell,\r\nthe Tory wag of the House, spoke fifty-eight times. Finally the Opposition\r\nwas caught unawares late one night on September 19, when they could muster\r\nbut fifty-eight votes before the doors closed for division, and the bill\r\nwas thus passed to its third reading. The Tories took pains to be present\r\nin force a few days afterward, when the final passage of the bill was\r\nmoved. After a last passionate debate lasting through three days and nights\r\nthe Commons passed the bill by a majority of 106 votes. That same night\r\nEarl Grey proposed the bill before the Lords. Addressing himself to the\r\nbishops he said significantly: \"I specially beg the spiritual portion of\r\nyour lordships to pause and reflect. If this bill shall be thrown out by a\r\nnarrow majority and the scale should be turned by the votes of the\r\nprelates, what would be their situation? Let them set their houses in\r\norder!\" These menacing words gave great offence to the clergy. The Duke of\r\nWellington spoke strongly against the measure. The bill was thrown out by\r\nthe Lords after an all-night debate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Riots in England]\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect was a sharp decline in stocks. A few hours after the\r\nHouse of Peers adjourned at six o'clock in the morning, a run for gold\r\nbegan on the Bank of England. The simultaneous effort of the French to\r\nabolish their hereditary peerage was hailed as an omen of what was coming\r\nin England. Riots broke out all over England. The return to Bristol of Sir\r\nC. Wetherell, one of the chief opponents of the bill, was made the occasion\r\nof ominous demonstrations. A riotous mob burned the mansion house over his\r\nhead. Next, the Bishop of Bristol was driven from his episcopal seat. The\r\nmob fired the mansion house, the bishop's palace, the excise office, the\r\ncustom house, three prisons, four toll houses, and forty-two private houses\r\nof prominent Tories.\r\n\r\nNo one was injured until the troops were called in to disperse the mob.\r\nThen a number of rioters were sabred and shot. About the same time riots\r\nbroke out at Bath, Worcester, Coventry, Warwick, Lichfield, Nottingham and\r\nCanterbury. With difficulty Archbishop Howley of Canterbury was rescued\r\nfrom the hands of an infuriated mob. The Bishops of Winchester and Exeter\r\nwere burned in effigy before their very palaces. The Bishop of London did\r\nnot dare to hold services at Westminster. The news from France served to\r\nincrease the alarm. Disturbances of a far more serious character were\r\nreported from Lyons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reform Bill up again]\r\n\r\nLate in the year, after another rejection of the Reform Bill by the Lords,\r\nthe bill was triumphantly reintroduced in the Commons. The question now was\r\nno longer, \"What will the Lords do?\" but, \"What will be done with the\r\nLords?\" Rather than risk the threatening downfall of the House of Peers,\r\nthe Ministers reluctantly determined to pack the Upper House by the\r\ncreation of a sufficient number of new peers pledged to vote for the Reform\r\nBill. A verse attributed to Macaulay ran:\r\n\r\n  What though now opposed I be,\r\n  Twenty peers shall carry me,\r\n  If twenty won't, thirty will,\r\n  For I'm his Majesty's bouncing Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" as Molesworth, the historian of the Reform Bill, has put it, \"amid\r\nthe anxieties of the reformers on one hand, and the dread of revolution on\r\nthe other, amid incendiary fires and Asiatic cholera spreading throughout\r\nthe country, amid distress of trade and dread of coming bankruptcy, the\r\nyear 1831 went gloomily out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1832\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English sedition trials]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Grey's Cabinet]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington impotent]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King humiliated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of Reform Bill]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes effected]\r\n\r\nThe new year opened in England with a series of trials arising out of the\r\ndisturbances which followed the rejection of the Reform Bill in the House\r\nof Lords. A great number of rioters were convicted. Altogether, seven men\r\nwere put to death at Bristol and Nottingham. The officers who commanded the\r\ntroops during the riots were court-martialed. When Parliament reassembled,\r\nthe Commons once more passed the Reform Bill and carried it up to the\r\nLords. In the course of the renewed debate on the Reform Bill in the House\r\nof Peers the Duke of Wellington announced that he had reason to believe\r\nthat the King did not approve of the bill. The statement was confirmed by\r\nthe King's refusal to create new peers wherewith to pass the bill through\r\nthe Upper House. Thereupon Lord Grey and his colleagues resigned from the\r\nMinistry. The King accepted their resignation. Monster petitions were\r\nimmediately sent in to the Commons from Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and\r\nother great centres of population, urging the Commons to refuse the\r\nsupplies until reform should have been secured. Once more stocks fell\r\nsharply. For the express purpose of embarrassing the King's chosen\r\nsuccessors for the Cabinet, runs were made on the Bank of England, and on\r\nthe savings banks at Birmingham and Manchester. The streets of London were\r\ncovered with placards: \"Go for gold and stop the Duke!\" In the face of this\r\nagitation the Duke of Wellington declined the King's offer to form a\r\nMinistry. Sir Robert Peel likewise declined. As a last resort Wellington\r\nconsented to form a Ministry, but could not get together a Cabinet strong\r\nenough to stem the storm. The Iron Duke's popularity as well as the King's\r\nwas at an end. When the King came up to London, accompanied by his sons,\r\nthey were received with hoots and insults. Missiles were thrown at the\r\nroyal carriage, and the Life Guards had to fight a way through the mob with\r\ntheir swords. The King was driven to the humiliating expedient of recalling\r\nhis dismissed Ministers. William IV. now consented to create the required\r\nnumber of new peers. Lord Brougham gave mortal offence to the King by a\r\nrequest that he should put his promise in writing. With the King's written\r\npledge in their hands the Ministers obtained an agreement from their\r\nopponents to pass the bill without further coercion. Early in June, at\r\nlength, the Reform Bill passed through the House of Lords after a third\r\nreading. One hundred and six peers voted for it and only twenty-two against\r\nit. On this occasion Sir Robert Peel made a remark to which his subsequent\r\nchange of front gave peculiar significance: \"Whenever the government comes\r\nto deal with the corn laws, the precedent formed by the present occasion\r\nwill be appealed to.\" The reform measure, as at last adopted, swept away\r\n142 seats in the Commons. It gave to the counties sixty-five additional\r\nrepresentatives and conferred the right of sending members to Parliament on\r\nManchester, Birmingham, Leeds and thirty-nine other large towns hitherto\r\nunrepresented. The King showed his disapproval of the reform by\r\nperemptorily declining to give his assent to the bill in person. The\r\nCrown's sanction was given by commission. This ended all agitation for the\r\ntime being.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Otto, King of Greece]\r\n\r\nIt was in May that the great Powers, in response to another appeal from\r\nGreece, suggested Prince Otto of Wittelsbach, the second son of the\r\nPhilhellene King of Bavaria, for the vacant throne. This choice was\r\nratified in October amid general rejoicings by the population of Greece.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign intervention in Italy]\r\n\r\nIn Italy, early in the year, the Pope's failure to carry out his promise of\r\nreform created new troubles. An amnesty, which had been granted by the\r\nlegate Benvenuti, was disregarded and the papal soldiery practiced all\r\nmanner of repression. Another revolt broke out and once more the Austrians,\r\nat the Pope's request, crossed the frontier. They restored order so well\r\nthat they were actually welcomed as protectors against the ruthless\r\ncondottieri of the papal troops. Austria's intervention was resented by\r\nFrance as a breach of the peace. Casimir Périer, now on his deathbed,\r\ndespatched a French force to Ancona. The town was seized before the\r\nAustrians could approach it. Austria accepted the situation, and both\r\npowers in Italy remained face to face jealously watching each other. Had\r\nCasimir Périer lived he might have made Ancona a lever for effecting the\r\ndesired reforms at Rome. As it was, the French garrison at Ancona remained\r\nmerely as a balancing point between the contending parties in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Cuvier]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cuvier's Works]\r\n\r\nFrance in the same year lost one of its distinguished men of science, by\r\nthe death of Baron Cuvier, the great naturalist. Georges Leopold Cuvier was\r\nborn in 1769 at Montbeliard. After studying at Stuttgart he became private\r\ntutor in the family of Count D'Hericy in Normandy, where he was at liberty\r\nto devote his leisure to natural science and in particular to zoology. A\r\nnatural classification of the _Vermæ_ or worms was his first achievement.\r\nThe ability and knowledge shown in this work procured him the friendship of\r\nthe greatest naturalists of France. He was invited to Paris, took a chair\r\nat the Ecole Centrale, and was received by the Institute as a member of the\r\nfirst class. His lectures on natural history, distinguished not less for\r\nthe elegance of their style than for profound knowledge and daring\r\nspeculation, were attended by some of the most accomplished persons of\r\nParis. In January, 1800, Cuvier was appointed to the Collège de France.\r\nUnder Napoleon, who fully recognized his merits, Cuvier held important\r\noffices in the department of public instruction. Under the Restoration he\r\nwas made one of the forty members of the French Academy. In 1831, a year\r\nprior to his death, he was appointed a Peer of France. Among the numerous\r\nworks by which Cuvier greatly expanded the study of natural history may be\r\nmentioned as foremost \"Researches into Fossil Bones,\" \"Discourse of the\r\nRevolutions on the Surface of the Globe,\" \"A Course of Comparative\r\nAnatomy,\" \"Natural History of Fishes,\" and his great work, \"The Animal\r\nKingdom,\" with its subdivisions into the four great classes--vertebrates,\r\nmollusks, articulates and radiates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Goethe]\r\n\r\nOn March 22, Wolfgang von Goethe, Germany's foremost man of letters,\r\nexpired at Weimar. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was born in 1749, at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main, the son of a councillor under the old German empire.\r\nHis best traits were inherited from his mother. As he himself sang in later\r\nyears:\r\n\r\n  Vom Vater hab ich die Statur,\r\n  Des Lebens ernstes Fuhren,\r\n  Vom Mutterchen die Frohnatur\r\n  Und Lust zum Fabuliren.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A:\r\n  From my father I have my stature\r\n  And serious view of life;\r\n  From dear little mother my glad heart\r\n  And fondness for telling stories.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goethe's career]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Goetz von Berlichingen\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Sorrows of Werther\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goethe at Weimar]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Hermann und Dorothea\"]\r\n\r\nHis father had him educated for the study of law. In his sixteenth year he\r\nwas sent to the University at Leipzig. Later he went to Strasburg, where he\r\nbecame acquainted with the poet Herder, and had his first love affair with\r\nFriederike Brion of Sesenheim, whose charm has been kept alive in Goethe's\r\nautobiography, \"Dichtung und Wahrheit.\" In 1772 he returned to Frankfort\r\nand practiced law. While thus engaged he wrote his first\r\nromantic-historical play, \"Goetz von Berlichingen.\" In the following year\r\nhe published his sentimental romance, \"The Sorrows of Werther,\" based in a\r\nmeasure on one of his own unfortunate love affairs at Wetzlar. Both of\r\nthese early works achieved instant success. \"The Sorrows of Werther\"\r\ninaugurated in German literature what is known as the period of storm and\r\nstress. Disenchantment of life, or \"Weltschmerz,\" became a fashionable\r\nmalady. The romantic suicide of Goethe's sentimental hero Werther was aped\r\nby a number of over-susceptible young persons. Wieland drew the attention\r\nof the Duke of Weimar to Goethe, and the young poet was invited to Weimar.\r\nHe remained under the patronage of this enlightened prince until the end of\r\nhis days. At Weimar, Goethe was the centre of a court comprising some of\r\nthe foremost spirits of Germany. The little capital became a Mecca for\r\npoets, scholars, artists and musicians from all over the world. Goethe's\r\nonly rival poet in Germany, Schiller, was drawn into the circle and the two\r\nbecame life-long friends. Most of Goethe's lyric poems were written during\r\nthe first ten years at Weimar. At the outbreak of the French Revolution he\r\naccompanied the Duke of Weimar in one of the campaigns against France. The\r\nthrilling atmosphere of the Revolution furnished him with a literary\r\nbackground for his epic idyl, \"Hermann und Dorothea.\" Goethe's subsequent\r\njourney to Italy, which was a turning-point in the poet's career, was\r\ncommemorated in his \"Letters from Italy\"--a classic among German books of\r\ntravel. Another eminently successful creation was the epic of \"Reynard, the\r\nFox,\" modelled after the famous bestiary poems of early Flemish and\r\nFrench literature.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE KING OF ROME\r\n    Painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goethe's dramas]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Wilhelm Meister\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Dichtung und Wahrheit\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Faust\"]\r\n\r\nDuring the same period Goethe wrote four of his greatest dramas, \"Iphigenie\r\nin Tauris,\" \"Torquato Tasso,\" \"Egmont,\" and the first part of \"Faust.\"\r\nLater he wrote his great prose work, \"Die Wahlverwandtschaften,\" a\r\nquasi-physiological romance; \"Wilhelm Meister's Lehr und Wander Jahre,\" a\r\nnarrative interspersed with some of Goethe's finest lyrics, such as the\r\nsongs of Mignon and of the old harper, as well as the famous critique of\r\nHamlet. The height of Goethe's superb prose style was reached in \"Dichtung\r\nund Wahrheit,\" which stands as one of the most charming autobiographies of\r\nall times. Goethe's versatility as a writer and man was shown not only by\r\nhis free use of all literary forms, but also by his essays on such abstruse\r\nsubjects as astrology, optics, the theory of color, comparative anatomy and\r\nbotany. Shortly before his death, the poet finished the greatest of his\r\nworks, the tragedy \"Faust.\" He died in the eighty-third year of his life,\r\nuttering the words \"More Light.\" Goethe was entombed in the ducal vault at\r\nWeimar, by the side of his friends, Friedrich Schiller and Carl August of\r\nWeimar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goethe's genius]\r\n\r\nLike Heine, Goethe offended his fellow Germans by his apparent lack of\r\npurely national and patriotic sentiments. To the present day his outspoken\r\nadmiration of Napoleon and his cold abstention from the ardent enthusiasm\r\nof the Prussian war of Liberation have not been forgiven by certain\r\nGermans. As a man, Goethe has been denounced as an egotist, for the\r\napparently selfish character of his relations with women, ending with his\r\nmarriage to a woman far below him. On the other hand, Goethe must be\r\nregarded as the most universal literary genius produced by Germany. He\r\nstands in line with those master spirits of all ages, Homer, Virgil, Dante,\r\nCervantes, Shakespeare and Molière.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Scott]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Walter Scott's poems]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Waverley Novels\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scott a bankrupt]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Literary drudgery]\r\n\r\nA few months after the death of Goethe, in September, Sir Walter Scott died\r\nin England. Goethe was accustomed to speak of Scott as \"the greatest writer\r\nof his time.\" Shortly before his death Goethe said: \"All is great in\r\nScott's 'Waverley Novels'--material, effect, characters and execution.\"\r\nScott himself derived much of his inspiration from Goethe's writings. One\r\nof his earliest works was a translation of \"Goetz von Berlichingen.\" The\r\ncreation of Mignon, in \"Wilhelm Meister,\" furnished Scott with the\r\ncharacter of Fenella in his \"Peveril of the Peak.\" Scott began his career\r\nas a writer with a translation of Buerger's \"Ballads.\" His most successful\r\nmetrical pieces, \"The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,\" \"The Lay of the\r\nLast Minstrel,\" \"Marmion,\" and \"The Lady of the Lake,\" for the most part\r\nappeared during the opening years of the Nineteenth Century. Then came the\r\ngreat series of the \"Waverley Novels,\" named after the romance of\r\n\"Waverley,\" published anonymously in 1814. The series comprised such\r\nclassics as \"Guy Mannering,\" \"The Heart of Midlothian,\" \"Kenilworth,\"\r\n\"Quentin Durward,\" and \"Ivanhoe.\" Scott's historical romances, based as\r\nthey were on painstaking researches into old chronicles, revived in\r\nEnglishmen an interest in their own past. The romance of the Middle Ages\r\nwas recognized for the first time, if in an exaggerated degree, throughout\r\nthe civilized world. The romantic movement in French literature, now in\r\nfull swing, was directly inspired by Scott. Notwithstanding his great\r\nsuccess as a writer, Scott's later career was clouded by difficulties and\r\ndebt. Through his friendship with Canning early in his career he obtained\r\nthe post of court clerk in Edinburgh. This left him leisure to edit a\r\nnumber of literary works, such as the editions of Swift, Dryden and Sir\r\nTristan. The great popular success of his novels soon made him rich. His\r\nhospitality at Abbotsford grew so lavish that in order to defray his\r\nexpenses he joined in a financial partnership with his publishers. The\r\nfailure of the Bank of Constable, in 1826, and the consequent failure of\r\nthe house of Ballantyne, ruined Scott. His debts amounted to £117,000. In\r\nhis efforts to earn enough money wherewith to pay this enormous sum, Scott\r\nbecame a literary drudge. It was at this time that he wrote his\r\nseven-volume history of the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, \"Tales of a\r\nGrandfather,\" and a two-volume \"History of Scotland.\" His work as a\r\nhistorian was by no means equal to that of his purely literary creations.\r\nIn 1830, as the result of overwork, Sir Walter Scott suffered from a stroke\r\nof paralysis. A journey to Italy brought no relief. Two years later he\r\ndied. He was buried at Dryburgh Abbey. For several generations after his\r\ndeath Scott remained one of the most popular authors of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advances in Medicine]\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of good resulting from evil was afforded this year by\r\nthe revolting murders committed by Burke and Hare in Edinburgh. These two\r\nmen deliberately killed a number of persons to sell their bodies to medical\r\ndissecters. The discovery of their crimes led to a Parliamentary\r\ninvestigation in the course of which Sir Astley Cooper boldly stated that\r\nany man's body could be obtained in the United Kingdom if enough money were\r\noffered. The scandal resulted in the passage of an Anatomy Act licensing\r\nthe traffic in human bodies within strict limitations. Before this reform\r\nsurgeons experimenting in human anatomy had to rely on body-snatchers for\r\ntheir material. The repeal of the old laws on this subject removed much of\r\nthe odium hitherto attached to the science of dissection, while the\r\nincrease of experimental material gave a fresh impetus to the study of\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Napoleon II.]\r\n\r\nA menace to the royal crown of France was removed by the death of\r\nNapoleon's son, the young Duke of Reichstadt, erstwhile King of Rome. He\r\nexpired at Schoenbrunn, after an empty life spent under Metternich's\r\ntutelage in Vienna, and was buried there. His death at the time was\r\ncommemorated in the famous German ballad, beginning with the lines:\r\n\r\n  In the gardens of Schoenbrunn\r\n  Lies buried the King of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe French playwright Rostand made the life and death of this unfortunate\r\nPrince the subject of a romantic tragedy \"The Eaglet,\" in which Sarah\r\nBernhardt achieved so striking a success at the close of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempted revolts in France]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repressive measures]\r\n\r\nThe removal of another menace to Louis Philippe's throne was accompanied by\r\ncircumstances less tragic. In April, the Duchesse de Berry, wearying of her\r\nexile, crossed over to Marseilles and travelled thence in disguise to\r\nChâteau Plassac, in the Vendée, where she summoned the Royalists to arms.\r\nShe was betrayed into the hands of constables sent to arrest her, and was\r\nplaced in safe keeping at Château Blaye on an island in the Gironde. The\r\naffair took an awkward turn for the cause of the Orleanists in France, when\r\nthe Duchess gave birth to an infant daughter, whose parentage she found it\r\ndifficult to explain. Next, the death of General Lamarque, a popular\r\nsoldier of France, started an insurrection at Paris in the summer. An\r\nattempt was made to build barricades, and conflicts occurred in the\r\nstreets, but the National Guard remained true to the army and the King, and\r\nthe revolt was soon put down. The government of Louis Philippe resorted to\r\nsevere repressive measures, and trials for sedition were common. In Germany\r\na revolutionary appeal to arms, made at a popular festival at the Castle of\r\nHomburg, near Zweibrücken, resulted in renewed reactionary measures. The\r\nGerman Diet, at the instance of Metternich, declared that the refusal of\r\ntaxes by any legislature would be treated as an act of rebellion. All\r\npolitical meetings and associations were forbidden and the public press was\r\ngagged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naval demonstration at Lisbon]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil war in Portugal]\r\n\r\nThe excesses of Dom Miguel's followers in Portugal were followed by more\r\nserious international results. A series of wanton attacks upon foreign\r\nsubjects in Lisbon called for outside intervention. English and French\r\nsquadrons appeared in the Tagus. Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign\r\nSecretary, declared himself satisfied after Portugal had apologized and\r\npaid an indemnity to the British sufferers. The French admiral, unable to\r\nobtain quick redress, carried off the best ships of the Portuguese navy.\r\nThe worst result for Dom Miguel was the foreign encouragement given to his\r\nbrother, Emperor Pedro of Brazil, who was preparing an expedition against\r\nhim in the Azores. Some of the best British naval officers and veterans of\r\nthe Peninsular War were permitted to enlist under Dom Pedro's banner.\r\nCaptain Charles Napier took charge of Dom Pedro's navy. In July a landing\r\nwas made near Oporto, and that important city was captured by Dom Pedro's\r\nforces. Dom Miguel was constrained to lay siege to Oporto. Thus the civil\r\nwar in Portugal dragged on.\r\n\r\nThe most formidable revolt of the year was that of Mehemet Ali, the Viceroy\r\nof Egypt, against his suzerain, Sultan Mahmoud of Turkey. The disappointing\r\nresults of Egypt's participation in Turkey's war in Greece left Mehemet Ali\r\ndissatisfied. He considered the acquisition of Crete by Egypt but a poor\r\nrecompense for the loss of his fleet at Navarino.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mehemet Ali's revolt]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Acre]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish reverses]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian intervention]\r\n\r\nA quarrel with the Pasha of Acre, Abdallah, gave Mehemet Ali a chance for\r\nEgyptian aggrandizement in that direction. Egyptian forces under the\r\ncommand of Mehemet Ali's adopted son Ibrahim marched into Palestine and\r\nlaid siege to Acre. That stronghold resisted with the same stubbornness\r\nthat Bonaparte had encountered years before. The protracted struggle there\r\ngave the Sultan time to prepare an expedition wherewith to intervene\r\nbetween his warring vassals. He took the part of the Pasha of Acre. A\r\nproclamation was issued declaring Mehemet Ali and his son rebels. A Turkish\r\narmy under Hussain Pasha entered Syria. The fall of Acre, while the\r\nrelieving army was still near Antioch, enabled Ibrahim to throw his full\r\nforce against the Turks. In the valley of the Orontes the two forces met.\r\nThe Turkish vanguard was routed and the Turkish main column fell back on\r\nAleppo, leaving Antioch and all the surrounding country to the Egyptians.\r\nThe Pasha of Aleppo, won over by Mehemet Ali, closed the gates of his city\r\nagainst Hussain's disordered forces. The Turks retreated into the mountains\r\nbetween Syria and Cilicia. The Egyptians pursued. At the pass of Beilan a\r\nstand was made by Hussain. The fierce mountain tribes turned against him,\r\nand with their help Ibrahim won a signal victory over the Turks, on July\r\n29. The retreat continued through Cilicia far into Asia Minor. After\r\nseveral months a new Turkish army under Reshid Pasha, Ibrahim's colleague\r\nin the siege of Missolonghi, advanced from the north. A pitched battle was\r\nfought at Konieh on the 21st of December. The Turks were utterly routed.\r\nThe army was dispersed and Reshid himself was made a prisoner. The road to\r\nConstantinople now lay open to Mehemet Ali. Sultan Mahmoud was so alarmed\r\nthat he turned to his old adversary, Russia, for help. General Muravieff\r\nwas summoned to Constantinople and was empowered to make terms for Turkey\r\nwith Mehemet Ali.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Affair of Quallah Buteau]\r\n\r\nIn America, likewise, President Jackson had found it necessary to assert\r\nthe rights of the United States by means of a punitive expedition. This\r\ngrew out of the affair of Quallah Buteau on the Island of Sumatra in the\r\nDutch East Indies. The American ship \"Friendship\" had put in there during\r\nthe previous year to load with pepper. The captain, whose men were on\r\nshore, permitted the crew of a Malay boat to come on board. There was not a\r\nsign of danger, when suddenly the Malays attacked the Americans, killing\r\nthe first officer and two sailors and plundering the vessel. They then\r\ntried to beach the vessel, but two other American ships compelled the\r\nMalays to flee. The Rajah of Quallah Buteau appropriated the plunder and\r\nrefused to return it. Commodore Downs, with the frigate \"Potomac,\" was\r\nordered to Sumatra. He reached there early in February. Finding that\r\nnothing could be accomplished by peaceful means he landed two hundred and\r\nfifty of his sailors under command of Lieutenant Shubrick. The Malays\r\nrefused to give or receive quarter. Their palisades were torn down and\r\nturned into a bridge, and the fort was stormed. The Stars and Stripes were\r\nhoisted. Another fort with its magazines was blown up. The town was\r\noccupied. In all one hundred and fifty Malays were killed and wounded,\r\namong them the Rajah. The total loss of the Americans was two men. The\r\noffending town was razed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Struggle over United States Bank]\r\n\r\nJackson's domestic policy during this year brought him into conflict with\r\ntwo powerful factors. One was the United States Bank at Philadelphia.\r\nJackson disapproved of the Bank on the ground that it failed to establish a\r\nsound and new form of currency. A financial panic had been caused by\r\nworthless paper currency issued by so-called \"wildcat\" banking\r\ninstitutions. A petition for the renewal of the National Bank's charter,\r\nwhich was to expire in 1836, was laid before the Senate. Both Houses passed\r\na bill to that effect. Jackson vetoed it, and a two-thirds vote wherewith\r\nto override his veto could not be obtained for the measure. Jackson then\r\nordered the Bank's deposits removed. He read to the Cabinet a long paper,\r\nin which he accused the officers of the Bank of mismanagement and\r\ncorruption, and stated that he would assume the entire responsibility for\r\nthe removal of the deposits. The Bank made a stubborn fight and spent over\r\n$50,000 in defending itself. In the Senate, Benton was the chief opponent\r\nof the Bank, and Webster was its principal defender. In December, the\r\nPresident sent a message to Congress recommending the removal of the public\r\nfunds from the National Bank to certain State banks. Congress refused to\r\nremove the funds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American tariff legislation]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South Carolina nullification]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's vigorous measures]\r\n\r\nThe passage of a new tariff law, on July 14, which was considered harmful\r\nto Southern interests, brought the Federal Government into armed conflict\r\nwith the South. On November 19, a State Convention met at Columbus, South\r\nCarolina, in response to a call of the Legislature, and on the 24th a\r\nnullification ordinance was adopted. The tariff laws were declared\r\nunconstitutional, and therefore \"null and void and no law, nor binding upon\r\nthe State.\" On December 10, President Jackson issued a proclamation against\r\nnullifiers, threatening them with trial for treason. Governor Hamilton of\r\nSouth Carolina in reply warned citizens not to be diverted from their\r\nallegiance to their State by this Federal proclamation. Jackson summoned\r\nGeneral Scott to Washington and sent a part of the army to Charleston with\r\na ship of war to collect the revenues. On December 28, J.C. Calhoun\r\nresigned the office of Vice-President on account of Jackson's proclamation.\r\nHe was forthwith elected Senator from South Carolina.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Payne's Landing]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troubles with Indians]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Black Hawk War]\r\n\r\nIt was during this year that renewed troubles with the Seminoles in Florida\r\nresulted in one of the most serious Indian wars of the century. By the\r\ntreaty of Fort Muller, in 1823, the Indians were to be confined to a\r\nreservation on the eastern peninsula, but the Territorial Legislature\r\npetitioned Congress for their removal. Finally, in 1832, the treaty of\r\nPayne's Landing stipulated that seven Seminole chiefs should examine the\r\ncountry assigned to the Creeks west of the Mississippi, and that if they\r\ncould live amiably with the Creeks, the Seminoles were to be removed within\r\nthree years, surrendering their lands in Florida, and receiving an annuity\r\nof $15,000 and certain supplies. President Jackson sent a commission to the\r\nWest to convince the seven chiefs that the country was eminently\r\ndesirable, and a supplementary treaty from these seven was obtained without\r\nconsulting the rest of the Seminoles. Many Seminoles were opposed to moving\r\nWest through fear of the Creeks. The Sacs and Foxes and Winnebago Indians\r\nof Wisconsin by treaty, in 1830, had ceded their lands to the United\r\nStates, but they still refused to leave their territory. Governor Reynolds,\r\nof Illinois, called out troops to compel them to go to the lands set apart\r\nfor them, west of the Mississippi. Black Hawk returned, but was again\r\ndriven off. In 1832 he came back with a thousand warriors and Indian\r\nwarfare broke out. Generals Scott and Atkinson were sent with troops to\r\nRock Island. It was the first time that a steamboat was used as a military\r\ntransport. The force was there divided. General Scott could effect nothing,\r\nbut General Atkinson pushed on, and in August defeated the Indians and took\r\nBlack Hawk and his two sons prisoners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cholera reaches America]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Charles Carroll]\r\n\r\nIn many other ways public attention was engrossed in America. On June 21,\r\nthe Asiatic cholera appeared in New York with appalling results. The\r\nepidemic spread to Philadelphia, Albany, Rochester, and westward. A number\r\nof new railroads were opened in New York and Pennsylvania. The first\r\nhorse-drawn street cars began running in New York. On July 2, the\r\nAgricultural Society of New York was founded, and the first public trial\r\nwas held of Obett Hussy's new reaping machine, which Cyrus MacCormick also\r\nclaimed as his invention. The device was destined to give a tremendous\r\nimpetus to agriculture in the development of the western prairies. About\r\nthe same time the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence,\r\nCharles Carroll of Maryland, died at the age of ninety-six. In American\r\nletters, this year is noted for the appearance of Smith's national anthem,\r\n\"My Country, 'tis of Thee.\" Among the books that attracted attention were\r\nWhittier's \"Moll Pitcher,\" Sparks's \"Gouverneur Morris,\" and Irving's\r\n\"Alhambra.\" James Gordon Bennett began the publication of the \"New York\r\nGlobe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1833\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American abolition movement]\r\n\r\nAt the very outset of this year in America the slavery question burst into\r\nflame. The abolition movement inaugurated by Garrison and Whittier in the\r\nNorth was in full sway. In the slave-holding States large rewards were\r\noffered for the apprehension of Garrison, Whittier and others connected\r\nwith the publication of the Boston \"Liberator,\" Philadelphia \"Freeman\" and\r\nNew York \"Emancipator.\" The legislatures of Northern States were called\r\nupon to suppress anti-slavery societies by penal enactments. Governor\r\nEdward Everett of Massachusetts and Governor Marcy of New York commended\r\nsuch legislation. Prominent Northern citizens travelling in the South were\r\narrested, imprisoned and flogged for flimsy reasons. At New York,\r\nMontpelier, Utica, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati and Alton, meetings\r\nwere broken up, houses sacked, newspapers destroyed and public halls\r\nburned. Berry's \"Philanthropist\" at Cincinnati and Lovejoy's \"Observer\" at\r\nAlton were destroyed and Pennsylvania Hall at Philadelphia, a costly\r\nbuilding intended for anti-slavery discussion, was burned on the day after\r\nits dedication, at which a poem by Whittier had been read. The firemen\r\nrefused to extinguish the flames. In Boston, Garrison was dragged through\r\nthe streets with a rope around his neck. Whittier and Thompson tried to\r\nlecture against slavery in Boston, but their meeting could not be held in\r\nthe face of the following placard posted in all parts of Boston:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A typical manifesto]\r\n\r\n\"That infamous foreign scoundrel, Thompson, will hold forth this afternoon\r\nat 46 Washington Street. The present is a fair opportunity for the friends\r\nof the Union to snake Thompson out. It will be a contest between the\r\nAbolitionists and the friends of the Union. A purse of _one hundred\r\ndollars_ has been raised by a number of patriotic citizens to reward the\r\nindividual who shall first lay violent hands on Thompson, so that he may be\r\nbrought to the tar-kettle before dark. Friends of the Union, be vigilant!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wendell Phillips]\r\n\r\nThese events inspired Wendell Phillips, who was present at a meeting in\r\nFaneuil Hall, Boston, called to approve these outrages, to take an open\r\nstand in favor of the rights of the people, which were threatened, and gave\r\nto the cause for thirty years his active brain and eloquent tongue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compromise tariff]\r\n\r\nAs a counterpart to the popular excesses in behalf of slavery, the\r\nCatholics of New England had to suffer persecution. At Charlestown, in\r\nMassachusetts, a mob burned the Ursuline Convent. Another indignation\r\nmeeting was held at Faneuil Hall in Boston to denounce this outrage. As a\r\nconcession to the Southern agitators, the American Congress, on February\r\n26, adopted a so-called \"Compromise tariff.\" The new bill cut down all\r\nduties of over twenty per cent by one-tenth of the surplus of each year,\r\nso as to bring about a uniform rate of twenty per cent within a decade. On\r\nthe other hand, Congress passed a \"force bill,\" which empowered the\r\nPresident to execute the revenue laws in South Carolina by force of arms. A\r\nState Convention in South Carolina for its part repealed the ordinance of\r\nnullification, but proceeded to declare the new Federal force bill null and\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Randolph]\r\n\r\nOn May 24, John Randolph of Roanoke, Virginia, a descendant of Pocahontas,\r\ndied at the age of sixty. He commenced public life in 1799, and served\r\nthirty years in Congress. There he became distinguished for his eccentric\r\nconduct, his sharpness of wit, and his galling sarcasm, which made him\r\nfeared by all parties. He had to resign from the Cabinet under odious\r\ncharges. In 1830, Jackson appointed him Minister to Russia. Randolph's\r\nspeeches are still widely read.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texas filibusters]\r\n\r\nIn the extreme South the American settlers of Texas, aided by Davy\r\nCrockett's filibusters from the United States, began a war for independence\r\nagainst Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English abolition movement]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gladstone's first speech in Parliament]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Misgovernment in Ireland]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irish resentment]\r\n\r\nThe abolition of slavery was likewise the most absorbing topic that came up\r\nduring this year in the Parliament of England. Young Gladstone, the newly\r\nelected member from Newark, taunted with his father's slave-holding methods\r\nat Demerara, made his maiden speech in Parliament on this subject. One who\r\nheard the rising orator recorded: \"Burke himself could not be more\r\nsympathetic, more earnest, and more strong.\" Another engrossing topic was\r\nthat of Ireland. The state of Ireland at this period, as conceded by a\r\nTory historian of modern England, was a disgrace to the history of the\r\nNineteenth Century. So wretched was the government of this unhappy\r\ndependency that during the year 1832 alone nearly 1,500 people were\r\nmurdered and robbed in Ireland. Instead of giving to Ireland a better\r\nadministration, Parliament passed another coercion bill. Tithes for the\r\nProtestant clergy were collected at the point of the bayonet. The cause of\r\nIreland, as heretofore, was pleaded most eloquently by Daniel O'Connell. He\r\ndenounced the Irish Church bill as \"the basest act which a national\r\nassembly could sanction.\" The people became so enraged that when an\r\nEnglishman was killed in a riot the coroner's jury returned a verdict of\r\njustifiable homicide. The Court of King's Bench quashed the verdict and\r\ntried the murderer before a jury. He was acquitted in the face of the\r\nclearest proofs against him and in direct contravention of the instructions\r\nof the judge. The spirit of the English aristocracy was indicated by the\r\nfact that a bill for relieving Jews from their civil disabilities was\r\nthrown out by the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Wilberforce]\r\n\r\nOn July 26, William Wilberforce died in his seventy-fourth year. He lived\r\nlong enough to hear that the bill for the abolition of slavery in the\r\nBritish colonies, to which he had devoted the greater part of his life, had\r\npassed its second reading, and that success was assured. Of all English\r\nadvocates of human freedom he was the most persevering and faithful. After\r\na distinguished Parliamentary career of forty-five years, he gave up all\r\npolitical ambitions to devote himself to the cause of humanity and\r\nreligion. He had been the intimate friend and associate of Pitt, Fox, G.\r\nMilner, Brougham and Macaulay. His wish that he be buried simply and\r\nprivately was not granted by England. He was buried in Westminster Abbey,\r\nclose to the tombs of Pitt, Fox and Canning. Around his open grave stood\r\nthe royal dukes of Sussex and Gloucester, the Duke of Wellington, Lord\r\nChancellor Brougham, the venerable Archbishop Howley, with other\r\nrepresentatives from the House of Lords and Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tractarian Movement]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Newman]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Arnold]\r\n\r\nIt was at this period of the ecclesiastical history of England that the\r\nTractarian Movement began at Oxford. It is a significant fact that the\r\n\"Tracts for the Times\" appeared at Oxford within less than a year after the\r\npassage of the Reform Bill. The connection of the two movements has been\r\nrevealed in Newman's \"Apologia Pro Vita Sua.\" In January, Dr. Arnold, the\r\ncelebrated headmaster at Rugby, published his \"Principles of Church\r\nReform.\" He aimed at a reunion of all Christians within the pale of a great\r\nnational church. In the discussion that followed, the foremost spirits were\r\nNewman, Froude, Dr. Pusey, and Keble, the sweet singer of the Church of\r\nEngland, whose \"Christian Year\" will live as long as that Church endures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Browning]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Keane]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Steel pens]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Electro-magnetism]\r\n\r\nEnlightened Englishmen were further stirred at this time by the publication\r\nof Robert Browning's \"Pauline,\" a narrative in unusually virile verse, and\r\nby Edmund Keane's original creation of the character of \"Othello.\" The new\r\ninvention of steel pens first came into general use during this same year,\r\nas did Hansom's \"safety cab,\" and Lord Brougham's favorite style of\r\ncarriage. Robert Brown, an English scientist, in the course of his\r\nmicroscopic studies of orchids happened to make the important discovery of\r\nthe nucleus of cells. Joseph Saxton, an American, constructed the first\r\nelectro-magnetic machine in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bismarck]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt at Frankfort]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Caspar Hauser]\r\n\r\nThe invention of the electro-magnetic telegraph was claimed by Gauss and\r\nWeber in Germany. The first telegraph actually constructed and used was set\r\nup at Göttingen. Among those who witnessed it was young Bismarck, who had\r\nalready achieved a reputation as a duellist among the students of\r\nGöttingen. An impulse toward his political ambitions of the future may\r\npossibly have been given by the sensational events at Frankfort during this\r\nyear. A band of misguided enthusiasts attempted to establish German unity\r\nby a _coup de main_. They overpowered a small detachment of guards and\r\nhoisted the black-red-gold banner of Germany. The expected rising of the\r\npopulation did not follow. The little band of revolutionists was dispersed\r\nat the first appearance of a strong military force. It is characteristic of\r\nthe premature nature of this movement that it excited less serious\r\nattention in Germany than the death of Caspar Hauser, a freak foundling,\r\nwhose unexplained origin has remained one of the mysteries of the\r\nNineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Teplitz conference]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zollverein]\r\n\r\nThe affair at Frankfort received the usual serious consideration by\r\nMetternich, who arranged for meetings of the allied monarchs at\r\nMünchengrätz, and of their ministers and authorized representatives at\r\nTeplitz. The most beneficial measure agreed on at these meetings was the\r\ncomprehension of all German States in a tariff union known as the\r\nZollverein.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Otto's reign in Greece]\r\n\r\nFull recognition was given to Prince Otto of Wittelsbach as King of Greece.\r\nThe young prince, then in his eighteenth year, had already landed at\r\nNauplia. He commenced his reign with a regency consisting of Bavaria's\r\nablest ministers, Count Armandsberg, Von Maurer, and Heideck. King Louis of\r\nBavaria commemorated the accession of his son to the throne of Greece by\r\nerecting a number of monumental buildings at Munich in imitation of the\r\narchitecture of ancient Greece, and by mural paintings in the arcades of\r\nhis palace garden depicting all the most famous places and incidents of the\r\nGreek struggle for independence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French painters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Legendre]\r\n\r\nIn France, a new impetus was likewise given to art. Jean Baptiste Leloir\r\nbegan his career as a painter of religious and historical subjects;\r\nLecquereux, the great historical painter, stood already at the zenith of\r\nhis power, and Corot's exquisite landscapes were receiving their full\r\nmeasure of appreciation. In French letters, this year is noted for the\r\nfirst appearance of Balzac's \"Eugénie Grandet\" and Prosper Mérimée's\r\n\"Double Erreur.\" Legendre, the great French mathematician, died during this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Keteya]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compact of Unkiarskelessi]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moltke]\r\n\r\nIt was the foreign policy of France to supplant Russia as mediator between\r\nTurkey and Egypt. Admiral Roussin had made it plain to the Sultan that if\r\nSyria could not be reconquered from the rebellious Mehemet Ali except by\r\nRussian forces the province was more than lost to Turkey. Accordingly, a\r\nFrench envoy was sent to Mehemet's victorious son, Ibrahim, with powers to\r\nconclude peace on any terms. The French suggestions were adopted on April\r\n10, in the treaty of Keteya. The Sultan made over to his viceroy all of\r\nSyria and a part of Adana. The Egyptians consented to leave Anatolia. The\r\nSultan took the spoliation so much to heart that he turned from France.\r\nOnce more he entered into negotiations with Russia. Russian warships were\r\npermitted to enter the Dardanelles, and Russian troops camped side by side\r\nwith the Turks on the east bank of the Bosphorus. A secret treaty for\r\ndefence and offence was concluded between Russia and Turkey at the palace\r\nof Unkiarskelessi: The Porte undertook to close the Dardanelles to the\r\nwarships of all other nations whenever Russia should be at war. Thus the\r\nentrance to the Black Sea was made practically a Russian stronghold. As\r\nsoon as the purport of this treaty was apprehended it had the effect of\r\nuniting the rest of Europe against Russia--notably, France and England.\r\nHenceforth Russia's ascendency in the East was watched by the chancelleries\r\nof Europe with growing suspicion. Sultan Mahmoud set himself seriously to\r\nreorganize his army after Western models. Following the example of Mehemet\r\nAli, he summoned foreign officers to his general staff. It was then that\r\nMoltke, the subsequent strategist of Germany, entered Turkish service.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portuguese civil war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil war in Spain]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt in Cuba]\r\n\r\nLord Napier's namesake, Captain Charles Napier, had won fresh laurels in\r\nthe Portuguese war for the succession to the throne. In command of the\r\nfleet fitted out by Dom Pedro of Brazil he attacked and annihilated Dom\r\nMiguel's navy off St. Vincent. Napier's colleague, Villa Flor, landed his\r\nforces and marched on Lisbon. The resistance of Dom Miguel's forces was\r\novercome. On July 28, Dom Pedro was able to enter Lisbon as a victor. Still\r\nthe struggle went on. Among those who linked themselves with Dom Miguel was\r\nDon Carlos, the rebellious pretender to the throne of Spain. Upon the death\r\nof King Ferdinand VII., in September, and the coronation of the Infanta\r\nIsabella as Queen of Spain under a regency, Don Carlos was proclaimed king\r\nby his followers. The Basque provinces declared in his favor. Civil war\r\nbegan. Had Don Carlos crossed the border at once he might have captured his\r\ncrown. Unfortunately for his cause, he lingered in Portugal until the end\r\nof the year. The regency of Spain, in the face of this embarrassment at\r\nhome, was called upon to proceed energetically against a revolutionary\r\nrising in Cuba under the leadership of Manuel Quesada. Henceforth the Pearl\r\nof the Antilles was no longer the \"ever faithful Isle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1834\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Pedro IV.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quadruple alliance]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign intervention in Portugal]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pretenders withdraw]\r\n\r\nThe death of Pedro IV., the Emperor of Brazil and claimant king of\r\nPortugal, made matters worse in Portugal. Diego Antonio Fergio set himself\r\nup as Regent. Monasteries were suppressed and the Society of Jesus was\r\nexpelled from the kingdom. Dom Miguel continued his fight for the throne.\r\nDon Carlos, the Spanish pretender, remained with him. The situation grew so\r\nthreatening for the established governments in Portugal and Spain that\r\nthey, too, combined for mutual defence. Queen-Regent Christina of Spain\r\nfound that she would have to rely for support upon the Spanish Liberals.\r\nMartinez de la Rosa was made Prime Minister. His first measure was to give\r\nhis country a constitution, which was ratified, on April 10, by royal\r\nstatute. He then entered into negotiations with Portugal as well as with\r\nEngland and France to crush the two rebellious pretenders by a combined\r\neffort. On April 22, a fourfold treaty was signed at London by the terms of\r\nwhich the Spanish and Portuguese Governments undertook to proceed\r\nconjointly against Miguel and Carlos. England promised to co-operate with\r\nher fleet. France agreed to send an army into the Peninsula if called upon.\r\nBefore the treaty had been ratified even by the English Parliament and\r\nFrench Chambers, General Rodil marched a Spanish division into Portugal.\r\nDom Miguel's forces were driven before him. The threatening demonstrations\r\nof British cruisers and the simultaneous publication of the terms of the\r\nquadruple alliance in Lisbon and Madrid cowed the revolutionists. On May\r\n22, Dom Miguel yielded. On the promise of a handsome pension, he renounced\r\nhis rights to the crown of Braganza and agreed to leave Portugal forever.\r\nDon Carlos, while declining thus to sell his rights, took refuge with the\r\nBritish admiral on his flagship and was taken to London.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return of Don Carlos]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zumalacarregui]\r\n\r\nFor a while it seemed as if order had been restored in the Peninsula. The\r\nproblem of Portugal was settled. Don Carlos' shrewd move, however, left\r\nmatters open in Spain. The pretender had not been made a prisoner of war,\r\nnor was he placed under any constraint or obligations. After a short\r\nresidence in England he crossed the Channel, and, travelling through France\r\nin disguise, reappeared on July 10 in Navarre, where Zumalacarregui, a\r\nbrigand chief of considerable military ability, was conducting brilliant\r\noperations against the Spanish government forces. Of the detachments sent\r\nagainst him one after another was defeated in the mountains of Navarre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish reverses]\r\n\r\nAll manner of help from the peasants was obtained by a system of ruthless\r\nintimidation. The personal presence of Don Carlos strengthened the cause.\r\nIt was in vain that old General Mina, who had won renown in these parts ten\r\nyears ago, was sent against the Carlists. Unable to cope with them, the\r\nold soldier resigned from his command. The Spanish Minister, Valdes,\r\nthereupon took the field himself. His attempt to operate in Navarre with a\r\nlarge army resulted in the worst defeat that had yet befallen the\r\ngovernment forces. He had to retreat before the victorious Carlists.\r\nZumalacarregui prepared to cross the Ebro to march upon Madrid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delacey's expedition to Spain]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French intervention refused]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of La Rosa's Ministry]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Ministry in alarm turned to its allies for aid. The English\r\nGovernment would render no further aid beyond that already given by the\r\nBritish squadron in Spanish waters. Permission, however, was granted to\r\nenroll volunteers for the Spanish cause in England and in Ireland. Colonel\r\nDelacey Ebbons raised a corps of needy adventurers, and, having been\r\nsupplied with arms and funds, crossed over to Spain. The first appeal for\r\nFrench intervention resulted in like failure. France had cause to hesitate\r\nbefore embarking in another Peninsular War. Lord Palmerston's refusal on\r\nbehalf of the British Government to co-operate with France in any such\r\nundertaking gave Louis Philippe reason to reflect. A large party in France,\r\nmoreover, was in sympathy with Don Carlos. The Spanish Government was\r\ninformed that French military assistance, under the circumstances, was\r\nimpossible. The first result of this refusal was the downfall of La Rosa's\r\nMinistry in Spain. The civil war continued.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolts in France]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Broglie's Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thiers, Prime Minister]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Lafayette]\r\n\r\nIn France, domestic troubles rather than international questions were the\r\nproblems of the day. On April 5, a violent outbreak had been precipitated\r\nby Mazzini among the workingmen of Lyons, which arose from a labor strike\r\ninvolving thousands. Soon the whole city was in uproar. Barricades were\r\nthrown up. Blood was shed in hand-to-hand fights with the troops. Similar\r\noutbreaks had been prepared at St. Etienne, Vienne, Grenoble, Châlons,\r\nAuxerre, Arbois, Marseilles, and Luneville. The insurrection spread to\r\nParis. On April 13, a conflict of some workmen with the troops was followed\r\nby the building of barricades all over the city. The revolt was ruthlessly\r\nsuppressed by General Bugeaud, the commandant of Paris, who was henceforth\r\ndenounced as a butcher. After it was all over the Ministry of Duc de\r\nBroglie fell in consequence of an adverse vote of the Chambers on the\r\nsubject of the indemnities due to America. The succeeding Ministry lasted\r\njust three days. Then came the recall of Thiers, Guizot, Duchatel, Humann,\r\nand Rigny. Marshal Mortier became President of the Council. The Chamber of\r\nDeputies was dissolved. The aged Prince Talleyrand quitted the embassy at\r\nLondon. A proposal to form a Ministry headed by Marquis de la Fayette for\r\nthe last time brought the name of that venerable hero into the public\r\naffairs of France. Shortly afterward he died in peace at La Grange,\r\nsurrounded by his children and calling for his dead wife. His burial in the\r\ngraveyard of Picpus, consecrated to the memory of the victims of the\r\nTerror, was left undisturbed by political demonstrations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lafayette's career]\r\n\r\nThe name of Lafayette is indissolubly linked with the cause of the American\r\nRevolution and struggle for independence. To join the revolutionists'\r\ncause, Lafayette not only had to sacrifice his private fortune and\r\nbrilliant prospects at home, but also to leave a young, dearly-loved wife\r\nwith an unborn babe. Throughout the weary struggle of America against the\r\noverwhelming power of England, Lafayette, together with Kosciusko and De\r\nKalb, stood by Washington and the cause for which he had drawn his sword.\r\nLafayette's presence in the American army, and the example of his constant\r\nfinancial sacrifices for the American cause, were instrumental in winning\r\nFrance over to that offensive alliance against England which helped to turn\r\nthe tide of war against that country. Throughout his subsequent career,\r\nLafayette sustained the reputation he had won in early manhood. He was one\r\nof the few prominent figures of the French Revolution who emerged from that\r\nordeal with untainted reputation. From then until his closing days he was\r\nthe foremost champion of liberal thought and political freedom in France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delaroche]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Blackwood]\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished Frenchman who died during this year was Jacquard, the\r\ninventor of the loom which bears his name. In the French Salon in spring,\r\n\"The Execution of Lady Jane Grey in the Tower,\" by Paul Hippolyte\r\nDelaroche, took the highest prize. The picture was a happy medium between\r\nthe ultra-romantic method of Delacroix and the classicism of David. Three\r\nyears previous to this, Delaroche sent to the Salon his famous paintings\r\n\"Cromwell at the Bier of Charles I.,\" and \"The Children of Edward IV. in\r\nthe Tower.\" At this same time he was engaged on the greatest of his works,\r\n\"The Hemicycle,\" now in the Hall of the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris.\r\nEngland lost three men prominent in letters, Blackwood, Lamb, and\r\nColeridge. Blackwood's contribution to English letters was the \"Edinburgh\r\nMagazine,\" founded and maintained by him from 1817 until his death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles Lamb]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Essays of Elia\"]\r\n\r\nCharles Lamb appeared in the world of letters as \"Elia,\" a fancifully\r\nadopted name of an Italian fellow clerk at the South Sea House, where Lamb\r\nserved his literary apprenticeship. While serving as a clerk for the South\r\nSea Company he published his first poems at the age of twenty-two, followed\r\nshortly by \"Rosamond Gray\" and \"John Woodville,\" at the beginning of the\r\ncentury. With his sister Mary he shared in the publication of the two\r\nchildren's books, \"Tales from Shakespeare\" (1806), and \"Poetry for\r\nChildren\" (1809). During this same period he compiled and edited the famous\r\n\"Specimens of Dramatic Poets Contemporary with Shakespeare.\" The \"Essays of\r\nElia,\" which made Lamb's reputation, did not appear until 1823. The charm\r\nof these essays is a frank note of autobiography tempered by a kindly humor\r\nand whimsicality peculiar to Lamb. His fond appreciation of the poetry of\r\nElizabethan days, as revealed in these essays, was instrumental in bringing\r\nabout that revival of Shakespeare and old English poetry which set in early\r\nin the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Coleridge]\r\n\r\nThus it happened that Lamb and Coleridge were intimately associated. Lamb's\r\nfirst poems appeared in a volume of Coleridge's. Lamb repaid the debt by\r\nhis tribute to Coleridge in his letters. There he has aptly described him\r\nas a \"logician, metaphysician and bard.\" It so happened that both friends,\r\nwho were almost of the same age, died in the same year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Lake School\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Swinburne on Coleridge]\r\n\r\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge was born in 1772 at Ottery St. Mary, in Devonshire,\r\nthe son of a clergyman. He studied at Cambridge and then went to London,\r\nwhere he enlisted as a trooper in a regiment of dragoons. Finding military\r\nservice uncongenial, he obtained a discharge and devoted himself to\r\nliterature. Together with Southey and Lovell he undertook to found a\r\ncommunistic colony on the banks of the Susquehanna in America. The project\r\nfailed from lack of money. The three friends married the three sisters\r\nFireckes of Bristol and settled in Stowey. There Coleridge, Southey and\r\nWordsworth founded their so-called \"Lake School of Poetry.\" Coleridge has\r\ntold in his \"Biographia Literaria,\" how the \"Lyrical Ballads,\" issued at\r\nthat time, derived their inspiration from two sources; to wit, supernatural\r\nthemes, which appealed to Coleridge, and homely every-day subjects, which\r\nWordsworth loved to beautify. Occasionally Coleridge tried himself in the\r\nother field, as in his \"Lines to a Young Ass.\" In the same year Coleridge\r\nbrought out the famous \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" his \"Odes,\" and wrote\r\nhis first version of \"Christabel.\" The period at Nether Stowey, from 1797\r\nto 1798, was Coleridge's most fruitful year as a poet. All his best poetic\r\nworks had their origin at that time. Swinburne has said of Coleridge: \"For\r\nheight and perfection of imaginative quality he is the greatest of lyric\r\npoets, this was his special power and is his special praise.\" Much of the\r\ncharm and magnetic suggestion of his famous poem \"Christabel\" rests on its\r\nexquisite vowel-music. The same is true of his wonderful \"Rime of the\r\nAncient Mariner.\" There the running prose glossary accompanying the poem\r\ndisplays the same delicate, fanciful tone as his most musical verse. By\r\nthese two poems alone Coleridge proved himself the most successful of the\r\nEnglish poets who have tried to imbue their verse with an eerie sense of\r\nthe invisible and the unreal:\r\n\r\n  Like one that on a lonesome road,\r\n  Doth walk in fear and dread,\r\n  And, having once turned round, walks on,\r\n  And turns no more his head;\r\n  Because he knows a frightful fiend,\r\n  Doth close behind him tread.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Aids to Reflection\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Sartor Resartus\"]\r\n\r\nAfter his twenty-fifth year, Coleridge's poetic qualities declined. As a\r\nresult of his travels in Germany he published, in 1800, a translation of\r\nSchiller's \"Wallenstein,\" after which he reluctantly undertook to edit the\r\n\"Morning Post,\" a government organ. In 1804 he went to Malta as secretary\r\nof Governor Ball. His last works were \"Biographia Literaria\" (1817),\r\n\"Zapolya\" (1818), \"Aids to Reflection\" (1825), \"Constitution of the Church\r\nand State\" (1826), as well as his posthumous \"Literary Remains,\"\r\n\"Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit,\" and the \"Theory of Life.\" In English\r\nliterary annals this year is noted likewise for the appearance of Carlyle's\r\n\"Sartor Resartus.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Church of Ireland]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal interference]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earl Grey resigns]\r\n\r\nA Parliamentary bill admitting dissenters to university honors in England\r\nwas thrown out by the House of Lords. Another bill for the removal of the\r\ncivil disabilities of the Jews was again carried in the Lower House only to\r\nbe rejected by the Lords. Next, another coercion bill against Ireland was\r\nintroduced by the Ministry early in July. In the Commons much fault was\r\nfound with the Government's manner of dealing with Irish questions. In\r\nspite of the concessions to O'Connell, that formidable leader had not been\r\nwon over. The Tories held that the Ministry had gone altogether too far. At\r\nthis critical moment, on the King's birthday, the Irish prelates, with the\r\nPrimate at their head, presented an address signed by fourteen Irish\r\nclergymen in which they deprecated the proposed changes in the discipline\r\nof the Church in Ireland. Instead of leaving the reply to his Ministers,\r\nthe King answered it in person: \"I had been by the circumstances of my life\r\nled to support toleration to the utmost extent of which it is justly\r\ncapable, but toleration must not be suffered to go into licentiousness....\r\nI have spoken more strongly than usual, because of unhappy circumstances\r\nthat have forced themselves on the observation of all. The words which you\r\nhear from me have not been learned by heart, but do indeed flow from my\r\nheart.\" This speech was received with transports of joy by the opposition.\r\nEarl Grey and his colleagues, on July 9, handed in their resignation.\r\nViscount Melbourne was called in with a heterogeneous Cabinet. During this\r\ninterregnum, on October 16, the two Houses of Parliament burned down.\r\nWestminster Hall, the Abbey and the Speaker's residence were saved, but all\r\nthe rest, including the interior of the tower and the library of\r\nParliament, was destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troubles in China]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opium trade resented]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Napier's defiance]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British ships fired on]\r\n\r\nThe most serious of the many embarrassments inherited from the\r\nAdministration of Grey was the trouble with China, that had arisen out of\r\nthe East India Company's opium trade in the Far East. When the charter of\r\nthe East India Company was renewed in 1834, it was shorn of its monopoly of\r\nthis trade. The consequent extension of the trade in opium, so strenuously\r\nopposed by the Chinese Government, incensed Emperor Taouk-Wang. Lord\r\nNapier, the new British Commissioner, reached the Canton River in July. His\r\ninstructions from Lord Palmerston were to foster the English opium trade\r\nnot only at Canton, but to demand an extension of the trade to other parts\r\nof the Chinese empire. The Chinese mandarins, under instructions from the\r\nViceroy of Canton, refused to have anything to do with Napier. He was\r\nlampooned in Chinese prints as \"the foreign eye.\" The Viceroy issued an\r\nedict forbidding the British Commissioner to proceed up the river. At the\r\nsame time all trade with English merchants was suspended. In defiance of\r\nthe Chinese orders Lord Napier left Macao, and sailing up the river made\r\nhis way to the English factory at Canton. There he found himself isolated.\r\nAn Imperial proclamation declared that the national dignity was at stake,\r\nand ordered all Chinese subjects to keep away from the Englishmen. The\r\nCanton factory was deserted by all of its coolies and domestic servants.\r\nLord Napier, ailing in health as he was, found his position untenable. He\r\nsent a final defiance to the Viceroy of Canton: \"The merchants of Great\r\nBritain wish to trade with all China on principles of mutual benefit. They\r\nwill never relax in their exertions until they gain this. The Viceroy will\r\nfind it as easy to stop the current of the Canton River, as to carry into\r\neffect his insane determination.\" After this the Viceroy sent his troops\r\ninto the foreign settlements, and ordered the Bogue forts to fire on any\r\nEnglish ship that attempted to pass. On September 5, two British ships in\r\nthe river were fired upon by the Chinese. The English merchants petitioned\r\nLord Napier to retire to Macao. This he did with a futile protest against\r\nChina's acts \"of unprecedented tyranny and injustice.\" Lord Napier died,\r\nleaving to others the settlement of the difficulties which his presence had\r\nintensified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Melbourne dismissed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peel dissolves Parliament]\r\n\r\nThe death of Earl Spencer, which raised Lord Althorp, his son, to the Upper\r\nHouse, gave the King a chance to get rid of his new advisers. When Lord\r\nMelbourne, on November 14, submitted to the King the changes he proposed to\r\nmake in the Ministry in consequence of the vacancies in the Exchequer,\r\nWilliam IV. expressed his disapproval and called in the Duke of Wellington\r\nin his stead. The Duke advised that the task of forming a new Cabinet be\r\nintrusted to Sir Robert Peel, then in Rome. Sir Robert arrived in London\r\non December 9, and at once accepted the task imposed on him. The opposition\r\nagainst his new-formed Ministry was so strong that it was decided to appeal\r\nto the country. On December 30, Parliament was dissolved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American slavery agitation]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Atherton Gag\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American events]\r\n\r\nIn North America, the contest between the Northern and Southern States in\r\nregard to slavery steadily gathered force. President Jackson, in his annual\r\nmessage, called attention to \"the fearful excitement produced in the South\r\nby attempts to circulate through the mails inflammatory appeals addressed\r\nto the slaves.\" The Federal postmasters of the South and in several cities\r\nof the North were encouraged in the practice of rifling the mails of\r\npossibly offensive matter. John Quincy Adams was threatened with public\r\ncensure at the bar of the House for proposing to print a petition for\r\nfreedmen. All attempts to get such petitions before Congress were defeated\r\nby a standing rule known as the Atherton Gag. During this year the national\r\ndebt was almost liquidated by Jackson's payment of $4,760,082. A measure\r\nwas passed through Congress establishing the value of gold and silver. Gold\r\nflowed into the Treasury through all channels of commerce. The mint was\r\nkept busy, and specie payments, which had been suspended for thirty years,\r\nwere resumed. Gold and silver became the recognized currency of the land.\r\nThe President's measures against the National Bank were less successful. On\r\nMarch 28, the Senate debated Clay's resolution censuring the President for\r\nhis removal of the government deposits. A joint resolution by both Houses\r\nof Congress was passed, in the Senate, June 3, by a vote of 29 to 10. Other\r\nevents of the year of interest to Americans were the popular riots that\r\nthrew New York into a turmoil on the occasion of the first mayoralty\r\nelection in that city, the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Legislature\r\nof Illinois, the establishment of the Indian Territory; and the first\r\nappearance of Bancroft's \"History of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Friction matches]\r\n\r\nOf world-wide interest was the emancipation of all black slaves in the\r\nBritish West Indies, South Africa, and other colonies; the establishment of\r\nthe German tariff union, including all German States except Austria; the\r\ntransfer of the capital of Greece from Nauplia to the site of Athens; the\r\nfoundation of the free university of Brussels, and the death of the great\r\nGerman theologian Schleiermacher. An innovation that was destined to add to\r\nthe convenience and comfort of domestic life throughout the world was the\r\nintroduction of lucifer matches during this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1835\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irish balance of power]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gladstone's anti-Irish speech]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: O'Connell's reply]\r\n\r\nOn February 19, Parliament reassembled. It was found that a working\r\nmajority of Tories had been returned, but the first vote on the King's\r\nspeech revealed a junction of the Whigs with O'Connell's Irish party, which\r\nforeboded disaster to the government. For the first time in Parliamentary\r\nhistory the Irish members held the balance of power. In vain did Sir Robert\r\nPeel attempt to stave off his downfall by the introduction of welcome\r\nmeasures of reform. Once more it was on a question affecting Ireland that\r\nthe government was defeated. This was Peel's high commutation bill. Lord\r\nRussell in reply moved that the surplus revenues of the Irish Church be\r\nused for non-ecclesiastical purposes. In the debate that followed,\r\nGladstone spoke strongly against the measure. For this early speech,\r\nembodying as it did views so radically different from those of his later\r\nlife, he was constantly reproached during his career. It ended with the\r\nwords, \"I hope I shall never live to see the day when such a system shall\r\nbe adopted in this country; for the consequences of it to public men will\r\nbe lamentable beyond all description.\" O'Connell said in reply: \"I shall\r\ncontent myself with laying down the broad principle that the emoluments of\r\na church ought not to be raised from a people who do not belong to it....\r\nAll that the Catholics of Ireland require is justice--equal and even-handed\r\njustice.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Peel's Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melbourne's second Administration]\r\n\r\nWhen the matter came to a vote the government was defeated by a majority of\r\nthirty-three. On April 8, the resignation of the Ministry was announced to\r\nParliament. The King sent for Earl Grey, and, on his refusal to form a\r\nMinistry, was driven to the humiliating expedient of recalling Lord\r\nMelbourne. On April 18, a new Cabinet was formed, composed largely of the\r\nmen who had been so summarily dismissed by the King a few months before.\r\nLord Melbourne's second Administration was marked by the elevation of the\r\nsettlements of South Australia to a Crown colony. The city of Melbourne,\r\nwhich was founded that year, was named in his honor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of William Cobbett]\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary career was ended, on June 18, by the death of William\r\nCobbett, from overwork in Parliament. With but little school education,\r\nthis remarkable man succeeded in becoming not only one of the foremost\r\nprose writers of English, but the leader of a great popular party.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Orange Lodges]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duke of Cumberland implicated]\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of Lord Melbourne's Administration, the discontent\r\nand irritation prevailing in Ireland were heightened by the agitation\r\nagainst the Orange lodges. The original purpose of these lodges had been to\r\ndefend, against the Stuarts and their supporters, the Protestant ascendancy\r\nwhich had begun with the reign of William of Orange. The lodges had grown\r\nin strength until, in 1835, it was estimated that they numbered 140,000\r\nmembers in Ireland, and as many as 40,000 in London alone. The Grand Master\r\nof all the Orange Lodges was no less a personage than the Duke of\r\nCumberland, the King's brother. It was believed in Ireland that a\r\nconspiracy existed on the part of the Orangemen to set aside the Princess\r\nVictoria, the next heir to the throne, in favor of the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nThe subject was brought to the notice of Parliament by Hume and O'Connell,\r\nwho drew special attention to the illegal introduction of Orangemen into\r\nthe British army, under warrants signed by the Duke of Cumberland. The\r\nscandal grew to such an extent that the Duke of Cumberland hastened to\r\ndissolve the order before a resolution condemning his conduct could pass\r\nthrough the Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Urban in South Africa]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginning of Boer trek]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, another war over boundary questions broke out between the\r\nDutch and English settlers and the Kaffirs. Sir Benjamin d'Urban advanced\r\nthe frontier of Cape Colony to the Keir River. The Zulu chief, Dingaan, on\r\nthe assassination of King Chaka, who had welded together a confederation of\r\nwarlike tribes, succeeded to his powers. In the midst of these difficulties\r\nan advance guard of Boers, exasperated by Great Britain's abolition of the\r\nold Dutch moot courts or \"Heemraden,\" and of slavery in Cape Colony,\r\ntrekked across the Orange River and founded a colony of their own.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South American disorders]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution of Texas]\r\n\r\nIn South America, political changes rapidly followed one upon the other.\r\nRocafuerte seized the reins of power in Ecuador. About the same time\r\nGeneral Rosas had himself re-elected for fifteen years as dictator of the\r\nArgentine Republic. President Santa Cruz of Bolivia made a raid into Peru,\r\nand in his absence the State of Bolivia promptly fell a prey to internal\r\ndisorders. In Mexico, General Santa Anna established his rule as dictator.\r\nThe affairs of Texas soon demanded his attention. On December 20, Texas\r\ndeclared itself independent of Mexico. Support came from the United States.\r\nThe revolution began with the battle of Gonzales, in which 500 Americans\r\ntook part. The Mexicans were defeated. Soon afterward Goliad and the strong\r\ncitadel of Bexar, known as the Alamo, were taken and the Mexican forces\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Osceola in Florida]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Payne's Landing disputed]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Seminole war in Florida had assumed a serious aspect.\r\nThe chief Indian leader who opposed the removal of the Seminoles west of\r\nthe Mississippi was Osceola, son of a half breed squaw and an Englishman.\r\nHis wife, the daughter of a slave, had been seized and returned to her\r\nmother's master. Thenceforth Osceola became an uncompromising enemy of the\r\nwhites. The Indian controversy with the American Government turned on the\r\ninterpretation of a pronoun in the treaty of Payne's Landing. President\r\nJackson held that the word \"they\" in the most important clause of the\r\ntreaty relating to the compensation of the despoiled Indians referred only\r\nto the deputies who executed the document, whereas Osceola contended that\r\nit was meant to stand for all the Indians. The continued quibbling so\r\nenraged Osceola that he drove his knife into the table exclaiming: \"The\r\nnext treaty I will execute is with this.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American progress]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New York conflagration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Justice Marshall]\r\n\r\nAmong the intellectual and scientific achievements of this year in America\r\nmust be reckoned Colt's invention of a revolver and the manufacture of\r\npins. Longfellow brought out his \"Outre-Mer,\" and Audubon published his\r\n\"Birds of America.\" On December 16, a disastrous fire destroyed most of the\r\ncommercial houses of New York City. In all 530 houses burned down and\r\n$18,000,000 worth of property was consumed. Chief Justice Marshall of the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court died during this year, eighty years of age. As\r\na member of Congress, a Cabinet officer, and the foremost jurist of the\r\nUnited States, Marshall won lasting distinction. His ability as a writer\r\nwas conspicuously displayed in his popular \"Life of Washington.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ferdinand, Emperor of Austria]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wilhelm von Humboldt]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Andersen's Fairy Tales]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, in the meanwhile, there had been some significant changes. On\r\nMarch 2, Emperor Francis of Austria died at the age of sixty-seven. The\r\nsuccession of Archduke Ferdinand to the throne produced no change in the\r\nnational policy. Metternich was retained at the head of affairs. Almost of\r\nmore moment to Germany was the death of Karl Wilhelm von Humboldt, the\r\ndiplomat, and brother to Alexander, the great German explorer and\r\nphilosophic writer. Besides his services as a statesman at the time of the\r\ninternational conferences at Paris and Vienna, he is distinguished for his\r\nphilological researches in the Basque and Kauri languages. About the same\r\ntime Hans Christian Andersen, the Danish author, published his first\r\ncollection of fairy tales. The book had an immediate success, and after its\r\ntranslation into German achieved a world-wide reputation. Various\r\ntranslations from the German version and from the original had large sales\r\nin England and America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Artistic activity in France]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: May riots of Paris]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fieschi's infernal machine]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second campaign in Algiers]\r\n\r\nIn France, too, notwithstanding political disturbances, fine arts and\r\nletters flourished. New creations appeared from the pens of Lamartine,\r\nVictor Hugo, Balzac, De Vigny and Alfred De Musset. Théophile Gautier\r\nbrought out his masterpiece \"Mademoiselle de Maupin.\" Among the musicians\r\nat Paris, Meyerbeer, Auber, Berlioz, Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Spontini,\r\nand Schapa were at the height of their activity. Politically it was a year\r\nof disturbances for France. The opening of the State trial of last year's\r\nconspirators before the Chamber of Peers was followed by diatribes in the\r\npress. The liberties of the press were further restricted. Riots again\r\nbroke out in May. After all, but one man was condemned to death. Most of\r\nthose who were implicated were sentenced to transportation. New laws for\r\nthe repression of sedition were proposed by the Cabinet. Then it was that\r\nthe first serious attempt was made on the life of Louis Philippe. Already\r\nseven projects of assassination had been discovered and frustrated, when a\r\ngrand review of the National Guards, on July 28, gave an opportunity for a\r\ntelling stroke. At the moment when the royal procession arrived on the\r\nBoulevard Temple, an infernal machine was set off by a Corsican named\r\nFieschi. The King was saved only by the fact that he had bent down from\r\nhis horse to receive a petition when the machine was discharged. Among\r\nthose that were struck down were the Dukes of Orleans and Broglie, Marshal\r\nMortier, General Verigny, and Captain Vilate. The perpetrators of the crime\r\nwere put to death. In French foreign affairs a renewed uprising of Arab\r\ntribes under Abd-el-Kader necessitated another military campaign in\r\nAlgeria.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, King Otto, having come of age on June 1, dissolved the Bavarian\r\nregency and assumed his full royal powers at Athens. His reign, lacking\r\nthough it was in national spirit or sympathies, assured to Greece an era of\r\nundisturbed peace and tranquillity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seminole War]\r\n\r\nToward the close of the year, the American Government's attempt to remove\r\nthe Seminole Indians from their hunting grounds in Florida resulted in a\r\nsanguinary Indian war. Micanopy the Seminole Sachem and Osceola were the\r\nIndian leaders. Osceola opened hostilities with a master stroke. On\r\nDecember 28, he surprised General Wiley Thompson at Fort King. Thompson had\r\nwantonly laid Osceola in chains some time before. Now Osceola scalped his\r\nenemy with his own hands. On the same day, Major Dade, leading a relief\r\nexpedition from Tampa Bay, was ambushed and overwhelmed near Wahoo Swamp.\r\nOnly four of his men escaped death. Within forty-eight hours, on the last\r\nday of the year, General Clinch, commanding the troops in Florida, won a\r\nbloody fight on the banks of the Big Withlacoochee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1836\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Withlacoochee]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Creek Indians subdued]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fight in Wahoo's swamp]\r\n\r\nThroughout this year the Seminole War in Florida dragged on. Gaines's\r\ncommand was assailed by the Indians near the old battleground of the\r\nWithlacoochee on February 27. In May, the Creeks aided the Seminoles in\r\nFlorida, by attacking the white settlers within their domain. Success made\r\nthem bold, and they attacked mail carriers, stages, river barges and\r\noutlying settlements in Georgia and Alabama, until thousands of white\r\npeople were fleeing for their lives from the savages. General Scott was now\r\nin chief command in the South, and he prosecuted the war with vigor. The\r\nCreeks were finally subdued, and during the summer several thousand of them\r\nwere forcibly removed to their designated homes beyond the Mississippi.\r\nGovernor Call of Georgia marched against the Seminoles with some two\r\nthousand men in October. A detachment of five hundred of these had a severe\r\ncontest (November 21) with the Indians at Wahoo swamp, near the scene of\r\nDade's massacre. As in so many other engagements with the Seminoles in\r\ntheir swampy fastnesses, both sides claimed the victory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diet of Pressburg]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magyar demands]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kossuth]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scechenyi]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transylvanian Diet]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vesselenyi]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, early during 1836, the conclusions reached by the long-sitting\r\nDiet of Hungary opened the eyes of the new Emperor of Austria and of\r\nMetternich to the changed spirit within their own dominions. For many years\r\nduring the long period when the government did not dare to convoke the\r\nDiet, the Hungarians in their county assemblies had opposed a steady\r\nresistance to the usurpations of the crown. These county assemblies,\r\nrejoicing as they did in the right of free discussion, and the appointment\r\nof local officials, were one of the hardiest relics of home rule existing\r\nanywhere in Europe, comparable only to the democratic government of the\r\nSwiss cantons and to the old English town meetings reconstituted in New\r\nEngland. By banishing political discussion from the Diet to the county\r\nsessions, Metternich only intensified the provincial spirit of opposition\r\nwhich he thought to quell. When the Hungarian Diet reassembled at Pressburg\r\nat last, the new spirit showed itself in the demand of the Magyars for the\r\nsubstitution of their own language, in all public debates, for the older\r\ncustomary Latin. The government speakers, who attempted to address the\r\ndeputies in Latin, were howled down by the Magyars. When the government\r\nforbade the publication of all Magyar speeches, Kossuth, one of the\r\nyoungest of the deputies, circulated them in manuscript. After the\r\ndissolution of the Diet, in summer, he was punished for this act of\r\ndefiance by a three years' imprisonment. The foremost leader of the\r\nHungarian Liberals at this time was Count Scechenyi, a Magyar magnate of\r\nnote. He it was that opened the Danube to steam navigation by the\r\ndestruction of the rocks at Orsova, known as the Iron Grates, and to him,\r\ntoo, Hungary owes the bridge over the Danube that unites its double capital\r\nof Budapesth and Ofen. Of the Hungarian noblemen he was one of the few who\r\nrecognized the injustice of the anomalous institution which restricted\r\nParliamentary representation to the noblemen, and absolved them at the same\r\ntime from taxation. The new liberal spirit thus manifested was turned into\r\nrevolutionary channels by Metternich himself. The dissolution of the\r\nHungarian Diet and the subsequent imprisonment of deputies whose persons\r\nshould have been inviolable aroused bad blood among the Magyars. This was\r\nmade worse by the peremptory dissolution of the Transylvanian Diet, where\r\nthe Magyar element likewise predominated. The leader of the Transylvanian\r\nopposition, Count Vesselenyi, a magnate in Hungary, betook himself to his\r\nown county session and there inveighed against the government. He was\r\narrested and brought to trial before an Austrian court on charges of high\r\ntreason. His plea of privilege was supported by the Hungarian county\r\nsessions as involving one of their oldest established rights. In the face\r\nof this agitation Count Vesselenyi was convicted and sentenced to exile.\r\nHenceforth opposition to the government and hostility to all things\r\nAustrian were synonymous with patriotism in Hungary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poland restive]\r\n\r\nThe discontent in Hungary and the Slav provinces of Austria was fomented by\r\na keen sympathy with the misfortunes of Poland groaning under the yoke of\r\nRussia. Notwithstanding Austria's official conference with Russia, Polish\r\nrefugees were received with open arms in Galicia, Bohemia and Hungary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The great Boer trek]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piet Retief]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zulu treachery]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Weenen]\r\n\r\nIn various other parts of the world the spirit of revolution would not be\r\nquelled. More Dutch settlers in South Africa sought relief from British\r\ninterference with their customs and the institution of slavery by\r\nemigrating into the virgin veldt lying to the north of their former\r\nsettlements. It was in vain that the British authorities of Cape Colony\r\ntried to stop this \"great trek.\" Rather than submit to British domination,\r\nthe Boers preferred to renew the inevitable struggle with the wild beasts\r\nand the savages of the African wilderness. While one part of the emigrant\r\nbody remained in the Transvaal and Northern Free State, the foretrekkers\r\npassed over the Drakensberg Mountains into Natal, under the leadership of\r\nPiet Retief. The land of Natal was at that time practically unpopulated.\r\nChaka and his warriors had swept the country clean of its native\r\ninhabitants, so Dingaan considered it within his sphere of influence. The\r\nBoers accordingly made overtures to Dingaan, Chaka's successor, who resided\r\nat his kraal on the White Umvolosi, a hundred miles distant in Zululand,\r\nfor the right to trek into this country. This was granted after the Boers\r\nhad undertaken to restore some cattle of the Zulus stolen by the Basutos. A\r\nthousand prairie wagons containing Boer families trekked over the\r\nDrakensberg into Natal, and scattered over the unpeopled country along the\r\nbanks of the Upper Tugela and Mooi Rivers. Piet Retief, with sixty-five\r\nfollowers, went to visit Dingaan in his kraal. They were made welcome. A\r\nsolemn treaty of peace and friendship was drawn up by one Owens, an English\r\nmissionary with the Zulus. During a feast, the Boers, disarmed and wholly\r\nunprepared for an attack, were suddenly seized and massacred to a man. Then\r\nthe Zulus, numbering some ten thousand warriors, swept out into the veldt\r\nto attack the Boer settlements. Near Colenso, at a spot called Weenen\r\n(weeping), in remembrance of the tragedy there enacted, the Zulus\r\noverwhelmed the largest of the Boer laagers, and slaughtered all its\r\ninmates--41 men, 56 women, 185 children and 250 Kaffir slaves. In spite of\r\nthis and other battles the Boers held their ground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South Australia settled]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British seize Aden]\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen likewise extended their colonial conquests. The unsettled\r\nBushland of South Australia was colonized by Captain Hindmarsh and his\r\nfollowers. They founded the city of Adelaide, named after the consort of\r\nWilliam IV. A wrecked British ship having been plundered by Arabs, the\r\nSultan of Aden, under a threat of British retaliation, was made to cede\r\nAden to Great Britain. New claims for territory were preferred by Great\r\nBritain against the Republic of Honduras, in Central America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mexican independence acknowledged]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defence of the Alamo]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joaquin Miller's lines]\r\n\r\nThe neighboring republic of Mexico, under the dictatorship of Santa Anna,\r\nat last succeeded in having its independence formally acknowledged by\r\nSpain. On March 6, Santa Anna, having raised a new force of 8,000 men,\r\nmarched on Fort Alamo, which had been left in charge of a small garrison of\r\nAmericans under Colonel Jim Bowie. All night they fought. Every man fell\r\nat his post but seven, and these were killed while asking quarter. Here\r\ndied David Crockett, the famous American frontiersman, whose exploits had\r\nmade him so popular in Tennessee, that, though unable to read, he was\r\nthrice elected to Congress. Joaquin Miller, the American poet, based on\r\nthis encounter his stirring ballad on \"The Defence of the Alamo\":\r\n\r\n  Santa Anna came storming, as a storm might come;\r\n  There was rumble of cannon; there was rattle of blade;\r\n  There was cavalry, infantry, bugle and drum,--\r\n  Full seven thousand, in pomp and parade,\r\n  The chivalry, flower of Mexico;\r\n  And a gaunt two hundred in the Alamo!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of San Jacinto]\r\n\r\nOn April 21 was fought the decisive battle of San Jacinto, in which Santa\r\nAnna with 1500 men was defeated by 800 Texans under Sam Houston. On the\r\nnext day General Santa Anna was captured. He was compelled to acknowledge\r\nthe independence of Texas, but the people of Mexico refused to ratify his\r\nact. Nonetheless serious hostilities against the Texans were abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peru and Bolivia joined]\r\n\r\nThe abolition of slavery in Bolivia gave a new impetus to the government of\r\nthat republic. President Santa Cruz of Bolivia felt encouraged by this to\r\nattempt to carry out his pet project of the amalgamation of Peru with\r\nBolivia. A prolonged guerilla war was the result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish rule in Cuba and Philippines]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil war in the Peninsula]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portuguese slave trade abolished]\r\n\r\nThe example of these movements in Central and South America encouraged the\r\nrevolutionists of Cuba to keep up their struggle against the rule of Spain.\r\nUnfortunately for them, the apparent weakness of the Spanish\r\nconstitutional government at Madrid did not extend to the more distant\r\npossessions of Spain. The only result of the rising of Manuel Quesada was\r\nthat Cuba was deprived of her representation in the Spanish Cortes. In the\r\nPhilippine Islands, Spanish rule was extended to the Island of Sulu. On the\r\nPeninsula, on the other hand, matters went from bad to worse. The Carlist\r\nwar continued unabated. On May 5, General Evans, commanding the\r\nconstitutional troops and foreign volunteers, won a victory over the\r\nCarlists at Vigo, but within a few months he was himself defeated at San\r\nSebastian. On Christmas Day, another crushing defeat was inflicted on the\r\nConstitutionalists by the Carlist leader Espertero at Bilboa. In Portugal\r\nthe marriage of Princess Maria II. to Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\r\nwas followed by fresh disorders. Revolution broke out at Lisbon, on August\r\n9, and could be subdued only by the re-establishment of the Constitution of\r\n1832. On November 8 came another popular rising. It was a sign of the times\r\nand of a more liberal turn of affairs at Lisbon that one of the first\r\nmeasures of the new government was a total abolition of Portuguese slave\r\ntrading.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British reforms]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles Dickens]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Pickwick Papers\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marryat]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Landor]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Mill]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wheatstone]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Balfe]\r\n\r\nReform of all kinds had become popular in England under the dexterous\r\nresistance of O'Connell, who held the balance in Parliament. The government\r\nwas induced to bring in a corporation reform bill for Ireland. An official\r\nregister of births, deaths, and marriages was conceded to the dissenters.\r\nNext came the abolition of one of the most barbarous practices of English\r\nand Irish law courts. Up to this time prisoners accused of felony were not\r\nallowed to be defended by counsel. At the instance of Lord Lyndhurst this\r\nwas now changed. Another gain for humanity was made by the abolition of the\r\nlaw which required that persons convicted of murder should be executed on\r\nthe next day but one. On the other hand a bill for the abolition of\r\nimprisonment for debt miscarried. The most potent plea against the abuses\r\nof this particular relic of barbarism in England was put forth by Charles\r\nDickens in his \"Pickwick Papers.\" These serial papers relating the humorous\r\nadventures of Mr. Pickwick and his body servant Sam Weller, when brought in\r\nconflict with the English laws governing breach of marital promise and\r\ndebt, had an immense success in England and all English-speaking countries.\r\nAlready Dickens had published a series of \"Sketches of London,\" under the\r\npseudonym of Boz, while working as a Parliamentary reporter for the\r\n\"Morning Chronicle.\" The success of the \"Pickwick Papers\" was such that he\r\nfelt encouraged to emerge from his pseudonym and to devote himself entirely\r\nto literature. Other literary events of the year in England were the\r\npublication of the initial volumes of Lockhart's \"Memoirs of the Life of\r\nSir Walter Scott,\" of Captain Marryat's \"Mr. Midshipman Easy,\" and \"The\r\nPirate and the Three Cutters,\" and of Landor's \"Pericles and Aspasia.\" The\r\nfirst Shakespeare jubilee was celebrated at Stratford-on-Avon in the\r\nspring. A loss to English letters was the death of James Mill, the great\r\npolitical economist, in his sixty-third year. About this time Wheatstone\r\nconstructed his electro-magnetic apparatus by which he could send signals\r\nover nearly four miles of wire. The Irish composer Balfe began his\r\nbrilliant career as a composer of English operas with the \"Siege of\r\nRochelle,\" produced at Drury Lane in London. About the same time\r\nMendelssohn brought out his \"St. Paul\" in Düsseldorf.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of La Malibran]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her operatic career]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alfred de Musset's lines]\r\n\r\nMaria Felicitá Malibran, the great contralto singer of the early part of\r\nthe Nineteenth Century, died on September 23, at Manchester, in her\r\ntwenty-eighth year. Taken from Paris to Naples at the age of three, she\r\nmade her first appearance as a public singer in her fifth year. Two years\r\nlater she studied solfeggio with Panseron. At the age of sixteen she made\r\nher début as Rosina in \"Barbiere di Seville\" at London. The success of her\r\nfirst appearance was so great that she was at once engaged for the season.\r\nNext she appeared in New York, where she was a popular favorite for two\r\nyears, singing in Mozart's \"Don Giovanni,\" in \"Tancred,\" \"Romeo and\r\nJuliet,\" and two of her father's operas. Here she married a French\r\nmerchant, Malibran. After her separation from him she returned to Paris,\r\nwhere she was engaged as prima donna at a salary of 50,000 francs.\r\nThereafter she sang at every season in Paris, London, Milan, Rome and\r\nNaples. For one engagement of forty nights in Naples she received 100,000\r\nfrancs. Both as a singer and woman she exercised an extraordinary\r\nfascination over her contemporaries. Only a few months before her death she\r\nmarried the violinist De Beriot. In England she suffered a severe fall\r\nfrom her horse, which shattered her health. After this she literally sang\r\nherself to death. Her loss was mourned most of all in France, where her\r\ndeath has been commemorated by Alfred de Musset's beautiful threnody ending\r\nwith the lines:\r\n\r\n  Die, then. Thy death is sweet, thy goal is won;\r\n  What is called genius by men here below\r\n  Is the great cry for Love; all else is but show;\r\n  And since, soon or late, human love is undone,\r\n  It is for great hearts and great voices like thine\r\n  To die as thou didst--for Love all-divine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meyerbeer's \"Huguenots\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gounod]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chopin]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liszt]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Georges Sand]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Ampère]\r\n\r\nIn France, great strides had been made in music, art and literature.\r\nGiacomo Meyerbeer, whose real name was Jacob Beer, surpassed the success of\r\nhis \"Robert le Diable\" with his greatest opera \"Les Huguenots,\" produced on\r\nFebruary 20, at the Paris Opera House. The success of this masterpiece so\r\ndisheartened Rossini that he resolved to write no more operas, and withdrew\r\nto Bologna. Charles François Gounod, on the other hand, now began his\r\nmusical career by entering the Paris Conservatory. Frederick Chopin, the\r\nPolish composer, at this time was at the height of his vogue as the most\r\n_recherché_ pianist of Paris. He was the favorite of a circle of friends\r\nconsisting of Meyerbeer, Bellini, Berlioz, Liszt, Balzac, and Heine. It was\r\nduring this year that Liszt introduced Chopin to Madame Dudevant, better\r\nknown as Georges Sand, the famous French novelist. Their attachment was the\r\ntalk of Paris. André Marie Ampère, the noted French mathematician and\r\nphysicist, died during this year at sixty-one years of age. He was the\r\ninventor of the electrical unit of measure which bears his name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thiers Prime Minister]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Algerian reverses]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thiers resigns]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fiasco of Strasburg]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon exiled]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amnesty acts]\r\n\r\nPolitically it was a turbulent year for France. On the question of the\r\nbudget the Ministry was defeated in January and had to resign. The new\r\nMinistry called in went to pieces on February 22, when Guizot and De\r\nBroglie retired from the Cabinet. Thiers was placed at the helm. On June\r\n26, another attempt to assassinate the King was made by Louis Alibaud, a\r\nformer soldier of the south who had taken part in the revolution of July.\r\nThe military expedition to Algeria under Marshal Clauzel and the Duke of\r\nOrleans first met with distinguished success. The French army occupied\r\nMascera. But later the unfortunate issue of an expedition against the town\r\nof Constantine caused the retirement of Marshal Clauzel as Governor-General\r\nof Algeria. Commander Changarnier at the head of a French battalion was\r\nbeaten back step by step by an overwhelming body of Achmet Bey's cavalry of\r\nthe desert. The question of French intervention in Spain resulted in the\r\ndownfall of the Ministry of Thiers. King Louis Philippe, ever since Lord\r\nPalmerston's chilling reply to his overtures for joint intervention, was\r\nopposed to such a project. \"Let us aid the Spaniards from a distance,\" said\r\nhe, \"but never let us enter the same boat with them. Once there we should\r\nhave to take the helm, and God knows where that would bring us.\" He\r\ndemanded the retirement of the French corps of observation in the Pyrenees.\r\nThiers was utterly opposed to this: \"Nothing can bring the King to\r\nintervention,\" said he, \"and nothing can make me renounce it.\" On\r\nSeptember 6, the Cabinet resigned, having been in power but six months.\r\nCount Molé was charged with forming a new Ministry. A new cause of\r\ndisquietude was given late in October by Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte at\r\nStrasburg. On the last day of that month, Louis Napoleon, with no other\r\nsupport than that of Persigny and Colonel Vauterey, paraded the streets of\r\nthat town and presented himself at the barracks of the 4th regiment of\r\nartillery. He was received with the cry \"Vive l'Empereur.\" An attempt to\r\nwin over the soldiers of the other barracks failed. The young prince was\r\narrested. Ex-Queen Hortense interceded in his behalf. The attempt to regain\r\nthe Napoleonic crown had been so manifest a fiasco that Louis Philippe\r\nthought he could afford to be generous. Louis Napoleon was permitted to\r\ntake himself off to the United States of America with an annuity of fifteen\r\nthousand francs from the royal purse. His adherents were taken before the\r\ncourt at Colmar and were all acquitted by the jury. A simultaneous military\r\nmutiny at Vendome was treated with like leniency. After the death of\r\nex-King Charles X., Prince Polignac and other of his Ministers who had come\r\nto grief after the revolution of 1830 were sent out of the country. A\r\ngeneral amnesty was announced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American elections]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Gag Law\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Smithson's bequest]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jackson's specie circular]\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Prince Louis Napoleon created little stir in the United\r\nStates. The people there were in the midst of a Presidential election.\r\nPresident Jackson wished Vice-President Van Buren to be his successor. He\r\ntherefore recommended that the Democratic nomination should be by national\r\nconvention. The National Republicans had by this time generally adopted the\r\nname of Whigs. They supported William H. Harrison and John McLaine of Ohio\r\nwith Daniel Webster of Massachusetts. The opposition hoped to throw the\r\nPresidential election into the House, but did not succeed in doing so. A\r\nmajority of Van Buren electors were chosen by 761,549 votes against 736,656\r\ndivided among the other candidates. Congress met on December 5. Arkansas\r\nand Michigan were admitted as new States of the Union. Before this\r\nJackson's Administration had won a complete success over his opponents. The\r\nPresident gave his sanction to a Congressional resolution in favor of the\r\nSouth, that \"all petitions, memorials, and resolutions relating to slavery\r\nshall be laid on the table, and no further action whatever shall be had\r\nthereon.\" A select committee resolved that \"Congress cannot\r\nconstitutionally interfere with slavery in the United States and it ought\r\nnot to do so.\" The so-called \"Gag Law\" was adopted by 117 over 68 votes.\r\nAbout this same time Congress accepted the bequest of James Smithson, an\r\nEnglishman, who left $515,169 to be expended in America \"for the general\r\ndiffusion of knowledge among men.\" After the fall of the United States\r\nBank, a number of State banks were formed, many of which were without\r\nadequate capital. Their notes were used in large quantities for the\r\npurchase of public lands from the United States. Thereupon President\r\nJackson issued the so-called specie circular, ordering federal agents to\r\nreceive no other money but gold and silver. This caused such a demand for\r\nspecie that many of these minor banks fell into difficulties. By the close\r\nof the year bank failures had become so numerous that a financial crisis\r\nwas at hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Madison]\r\n\r\nEx-President James Madison died this year at the ripe age of eighty-five.\r\nHis entire career was such as to make him one of the great line of Southern\r\nPresidents of Virginian stock: Washington, Jefferson and Monroe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seminole War]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American railroad development]\r\n\r\nThe military campaign against the Seminoles was far from satisfactory. Many\r\nof the soldiers sent into Georgia and Florida succumbed to disease. They\r\nhad to abandon Forts King, Dane and Micanopy, giving up a large tract to\r\nthe Indians. The Indians were defeated in battle at New Mannsville, and in\r\nthe fall of the year General Call rallied them on the Withlacoochee, but\r\ncould not drive them into the Wahoo Swamp. A change in commanders was once\r\nmore made, and Jesup succeeded Call. With 8,000 men he entered on a winter\r\ncampaign. The Indians were forced from their positions on the\r\nWithlacoochee, and were pursued toward the Everglades, and at the end of\r\n1836 sued for peace. On December 15, the Federal Post-Office and\r\nPatent-Office burned down. Irreparable loss was caused by the destruction\r\nof 7,000 models and 10,000 designs of new inventions. At the close of\r\nJackson's Administration some three thousand miles of railroad had been\r\nconstructed. Eight years previously, when he came into office, no railway\r\nhad ever been seen in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1837\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American financial crisis]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Government relief measures]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sub-Treasury system]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texas independent]\r\n\r\nThe financial crisis of this year was not only one of the most severe, but\r\nalso the most remarkable in the financial history of the United States. A\r\nCongressional act of the previous year provided that after January 1, 1837,\r\nall surplus revenues of the government should be divided as loans among the\r\nStates. The amount to be distributed this year aggregated $28,000,000. No\r\npart of this large sum was ever recalled. When the government called for\r\nits deposits in order to distribute the surplus an immediate shrinkage of\r\nspecie was the result. As bank after bank suspended, it was found that the\r\npaper issue had increased from $51,000,000 in 1830 to $149,000,000 in 1837.\r\nJackson's attacks on the National Bank had shaken public confidence in this\r\ninstitution, and it likewise suspended specie payments. The mercantile\r\nfailures of a single fortnight in New York City amounted to $100,000,000. A\r\nrepeal of Jackson's order that payments for public lands should be in coin\r\nfilled the National Treasury with paper money. Congress met in special\r\nsession to relieve the financial distress. A law was passed authorizing the\r\nissue of $10,000,000 in Treasury notes. This brought some relief. President\r\nVan Buren's first message recommended the adoption by the government of\r\nthe Sub-Treasury plan. A bill for the establishment of an independent\r\ntreasury passed the Senate, but was defeated in the House by a union of\r\nWhigs and Conservatives. The Sub-Treasury plan, as eventually carried out,\r\nprovided for complete separation of the National Bank and the government,\r\nand established the principle that the government revenues should be\r\nreceived in coin only. President Van Buren in his message specially\r\ndeprecated any interference by Congress in the struggle between Texas and\r\nMexico. Texas, which had been bargained away by Southern votes in 1819, was\r\nnow an eagerly desired prize. It had now become a part of Coahuila, and had\r\ndeclared its independence. Still Congress persisted in its attempt to\r\ninterfere, but a bill to that effect was voted down by the adherents of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distress in Spain]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, Bustamente had again become President. In the neighboring State\r\nof Colombia, President Marquez, likewise, had himself re-elected. The\r\ninfluence of North American progress was shown in Cuba by the opening of\r\nthe first railway there, long before the mother country, Spain, could boast\r\nof such an advance in civilization. There the civil war was still draining\r\nthe resources of the country. On May 17, General Evans took Trun, but\r\nfailed to follow up his success. In Portugal, the restoration of Pedro's\r\nCharta de Ley was proclaimed by the Duke of Terceira.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Guizot]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Fourier]\r\n\r\nIn France, an unfortunate attempt to fix large dowries on the Duc de\r\nNemours and the Queen of the Belgians raised an outcry against the private\r\navarice of the King. As the result of the Ministerial crisis that followed\r\nthe defeat of these measures in the Chambers Guizot had to retire from the\r\nMinistry. Molé remained in charge with the reconstituted Cabinet. The\r\nsuccess of a second expedition against Constantine, in which the Duc de\r\nNemours gained distinction, invested Molé's new Ministry with a certain\r\npopularity. Measures for a general political amnesty and for the closing of\r\ngambling houses were readily voted by the Chambers. The people of Paris\r\nwere kept amused first by the marriage of the Duc d'Orleans to Princess\r\nHélène of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and by the subsequent wedding of Princess\r\nMarie d'Orleans, the amateur sculptress, to Duke Alexander of Wurtemberg, a\r\ndilettante, like herself, in letters. The occasion provoked the German poet\r\nHeine, then lying ill at Paris, to some of his most pungent witticisms.\r\nAiling though he was, Heine was made a member of the new \"Société des Gens\r\nde Lettres,\" founded by Balzac, Lamennais, Dumas and Georges Sand. Further\r\nevents in French letters were the publication of Eugène Sue's\r\n\"Latréaumont,\" and the appearance of the early part of Michelet's \"History\r\nof France.\" François Charles Marie Fourier, the philosophic writer and\r\nfollower of St. Simon, died in his sixty-fifth year. Before his death his\r\nwell-elaborated system of communism, as put forward in his \"Traité de\r\nl'Association Domestique et Agricole,\" had found general acceptance among\r\nthe radical orders of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Leopardi]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ode to Brutus Minor]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A self-apostrophe]\r\n\r\nCount Giacomo Leopardi, the foremost lyric poet of modern Italy, died on\r\nJune 14. Leopardi's genius was tinctured with pessimism. Like Byron, he was\r\npowerfully moved by the painful contrast between the classic grandeur of\r\nancient Italy and the degeneracy of its latter days. The tendency toward\r\npessimism was increased by his own ill health. His first works were the\r\nresult of his eager study of classic antiquities. Thus he brought out a new\r\nedition and translation of Porphyrios' \"De vita Plotini.\" His earliest\r\nverses, such as the fine \"Ode to Italy,\" and his poem on a projected\r\nmonument for Dante, already contained the strain of sadness that ran\r\nthrough all his later poems. On the publication of Leopardi's first\r\ncollection of verses, Niebuhr, the Prussian Ambassador at Rome, offered him\r\na professorship at Berlin, but the poet's failing health prevented\r\nacceptance. Religious dissensions with his father depressed his spirits\r\nstill more. He gave expression to his increasing sadness in the beautiful\r\node on the \"Minor Brutus.\" In 1825 he took part in bringing out the famous\r\n\"Antologia\" at Florence, and also issued an edition of Petrarch and two\r\ncollections of Italian verse. Another collection of his own poems was\r\npublished in 1826, followed by the prose dialogues \"Operette Morali.\" In\r\n1833, declining health led Leopardi to withdraw to Naples. One year before\r\nhis death he brought out a last collection of poems distinguished alike for\r\npoignant pessimism and for their high lyric beauty. Characteristic of\r\nLeopardi's verse is this poem addressed to himself:\r\n\r\n  Now lie forever still,\r\n  My weary heart. Farewell, my last illusion\r\n  The dream that we endure. Farewell! Too surely\r\n  I know my end, and now of self-deception\r\n  The hope long since and dear desire has left me.\r\n  Be still forever! Enough\r\n  Of fluttering such as thine has been. Vain, vain\r\n  Thy palpitation, the wide world is not worth\r\n  Our sighs; for bitter pain\r\n  Life's portion is, naught else, and slime this earth.\r\n  Subside henceforth, despair forever!\r\n  Fate gave this race of ours\r\n  For only guerdon death. Then make a sport\r\n  Of thine own self, of nature, and the dark\r\n  First power that, hidden, rules the world for harm--\r\n  And of the infinite emptiness of all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Pushkin]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lermontov]\r\n\r\nRussia lost her foremost man of letters at this period by the death of\r\nCount Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin, as the result of a duel. His last\r\nwork, the drama \"Boris Goudunov,\" was left uncompleted. After his recall\r\nfrom his exile in Bessarabia, Pushkin had been appointed as imperial\r\nhistorian by Czar Nicholas, in which capacity he wrote a history of Peter\r\nthe Great and an account of the conspiracy of Pugatshev. Of his poetic\r\nworks, the most important was \"Eugene Onegin,\" an epic written after the\r\nmanner of Byron's \"Don Juan.\" \"Eugene Onegin\" has remained one of the\r\nclassics of Russian literature throughout the Nineteenth Century. Pushkin's\r\nbrother poet Lermontov, then an officer of the Guards, wrote a poem\r\ndemanding vengeance for Pushkin's death. He was banished to the Caucasus,\r\nand his writings were suppressed. Under a false name he now wrote his\r\nfamous epic: \"Song of Czar Ivan Vasilyevitch.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first kindergarten]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German clerical struggle]\r\n\r\nA joyful event in German letters was the great festival at Mainz in honor\r\nof Gutenberg and his invention of the art of printing. Froebel opened his\r\nfirst kindergarten at Blankenburg in Thuringia. Auerbach, the popular\r\nnovelist, brought out his \"Spinoza.\" Much was made by Germans of the\r\nopening of the first railway between Dresden and Leipzig, and of the\r\ninvention of coal-tar colors, or aniline dyes, by a process destined to\r\nrevolutionize the arts of coloring and dyeing throughout the world. A great\r\nstir was created by the imprisonment of the Archbishop of Cologne at Minden\r\nafter a quarrel with the Prussian Government concerning marriages between\r\npersons of different creeds. He was forbidden to go to Bonn. Backed by the\r\nHoly See in Rome, he continued to defy the Protestant authorities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of William IV.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victoria's accession]\r\n\r\nA change of rule, fraught with future consequences for Hanover, resulted\r\nfrom the death of William IV., King of England and Hanover, on the 20th of\r\nJune. By the death of the old King, his niece, Victoria Alexandra, then in\r\nher eighteenth year, became Queen of England. Miss Wynn, in her \"Diaries of\r\na Lady of Quality,\" has told how the news was brought to the young Princess\r\nat Kensington by the Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Howley) and the Lord\r\nChamberlain (Marquis Conyngham): \"They did not reach Kensington Palace\r\nuntil five o'clock in the morning. They knocked, they rang, they thumped\r\nfor a considerable time before they could rouse the porter at the gate;\r\nthey were again kept waiting in the courtyard, then turned into one of the\r\nlower rooms, where they seemed forgotten by everybody. They rang the bell,\r\nand desired that the attendant of the Princess Victoria might be sent to\r\ninform Her Royal Highness that they requested an audience on business of\r\nimportance. After another delay, and another ringing to inquire the cause,\r\nthe attendant was summoned, who stated that the Princess was in such a deep\r\nsleep that she could not venture to disturb her. Then they said, 'We are\r\ncome on business of state to the Queen, and even her sleep must give way to\r\nthat.' In a few minutes she came into the room in a loose white nightgown\r\nand shawl, her nightcap thrown off, and her hair falling upon her\r\nshoulders, her feet in slippers, tears in her eyes, but perfectly collected\r\nand dignified.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her first Privy Council]\r\n\r\nLord Melbourne, the Prime Minister, was summoned, and at eleven o'clock\r\nthat same morning a Privy Council was held, which is thus described by\r\nCharles Greville, an eye-witness: \"Never was anything like the first\r\nimpression she produced, or the chorus of praise and admiration which is\r\nraised about her manner and behavior, and certainly not without justice. It\r\nwas very extraordinary, and something far beyond what was looked for. Her\r\nextreme youth and inexperience, and the ignorance of the world concerning\r\nher, naturally excited intense curiosity to see how she would act on this\r\ntrying occasion, and there was a considerable assemblage at the palace,\r\nnotwithstanding the short notice which was given. The first thing to be\r\ndone was to teach her her lesson, which for this purpose Melbourne had\r\nhimself to learn.... She bowed to the Lords, took her seat, and then read\r\nher speech in a clear, distinct, and audible voice, and without any\r\nappearance of fear or embarrassment.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hanover separates from England]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ernest, King of Hanover]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal breach of faith]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt at Göttingen]\r\n\r\nThe first signature to the Act of Allegiance was that of Ernest, Duke of\r\nCumberland, eldest surviving brother of the late King William. To him\r\npassed the crown of Hanover, which for a hundred and twenty-five years had\r\nbeen held by the occupants of the British throne. Under the Salic law,\r\nrestricting succession to the male line, Hanover now became separated from\r\nEngland. On June 28, the new King arrived in Hanover. He refused to receive\r\nthe deputation of the estates that had come to greet him. Dispensing with\r\nthe formality of taking the required oath to the constitution, he dissolved\r\nthe estates. The validity of the Hanoverian Constitution was next called in\r\nquestion, and the restoration of the less liberal constitution of 1819 was\r\nordained. The first to protest against this royal breach of faith were\r\nseven professors of the University of Göttingen. Among them were the two\r\nbrothers Grimm, to whom the German language and literature are so deeply\r\nindebted, and Gervinus, the great historian of modern Europe. The\r\nprofessors were instantly dismissed. This high-handed act provoked an\r\ninsurrection among the students, which had to be quelled by troops, with\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the unpopular Duke of Cumberland and the dissolution of\r\nthe embarrassing connection with Hanover wrought distinct relief to the\r\npeople of England. According to usage on the accession of a new sovereign,\r\nParliament was dissolved, in this instance by the Queen in person. She\r\ndrove to the House of Lords in state, and created a sensation by her youth\r\nand graciousness. What she said of her own good intentions, her confidence\r\nin the wisdom of Parliament and the love of her people and her trust in\r\nGod, was re-echoed throughout the English dominion. Her popularity speedily\r\nbecame unbounded. The change in the person of the sovereign was a great\r\nadvantage for the Melbourne Ministry. They had no longer to fear such a\r\nsummary dismissal or interference by the throne as they had suffered during\r\nthe last reign. The dissolution of Parliament only resulted in their favor.\r\nThe Tories were in despair. The departure of the Duke of Cumberland, their\r\npower behind the throne, had deprived them of a leader. The old Duke of\r\nWellington regarded the accession of a female sovereign a probable bar to\r\nhis return to power. To a friend he said: \"I have no small talk, and Peel\r\nhas no manners.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Victorian era]\r\n\r\nThe Victorian era in England, a period comparable for brilliancy only to\r\nthat of Queen Elizabeth, began indeed under auspicious circumstances. In\r\nthe field of letters there was the galaxy of diverse spirits: Southey,\r\nWordsworth, Tennyson, and Browning. A new start was given to English prose\r\nby such powerful writers as Lord Macaulay, Carlyle, Charles Dickens, and\r\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray, who brought out his \"Yellowplush Papers\" this\r\nvery year. Another newcomer in the field of romance was the Irish\r\nnovelist, Charles Gaines Lever, whose early \"Adventures of Harry Lorrequer\"\r\nfound instant favor. Among the women writers were Maria Edgeworth, Jane\r\nAusten, and Elizabeth Barrett. Great strides were also made in science.\r\nShortly after the appearance of Whewell's \"History of Inductive Sciences,\"\r\nthe Ornithological and Electrical Societies were founded at London. The\r\nprinciple of working clocks by electricity was advanced by Alexander Bain.\r\nWheatstone and Cooke invented the magnetic needle telegraph. Ericsson's new\r\nscrew steamer \"Francis Bogden\" was found to develop a speed of ten miles an\r\nhour. John Upton patented his steam plow, and the first photographic prints\r\non paper were made by Fox Talbot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Macaulay joins Cabinet]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Famine in India]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boers defeat Zulus]\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament was reconvened, Lord Macaulay was added to the Cabinet. In\r\nthe northwestern provinces of East India a widespread famine, which cost\r\nthe lives of 8,000 natives, necessitated relief measures on a large scale.\r\nIn the midst of these troubles the death of the ruling King of Delhi caused\r\na vacancy, which was filled by Mahmoud Bahadour Shah, the last titular\r\nGreat Mogul under the protection of the British colonial government. In\r\nSouth Africa some measure of home rule was accorded to Cape Colony by the\r\ninstitution of a representative legislative council under a governor\r\nappointed by the Crown. To the north of Cape Colony the Boer emigrants\r\ncarried on their war of revenge against the Zulus. In a fierce battle on\r\nDecember 16, at Blood River, the Boers under Maritz and Potgieter utterly\r\ndefeated Dingaan's warriors. Pantah, the brother of Dingaan, became King of\r\nthe Zulus. The anniversary of this battle was ever after celebrated as a\r\nholiday by the Boers. A settlement was founded in the conquered land, and\r\nthe first church was built on the site of Pietermaritzburg, named after the\r\nBoer leaders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canada restive]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Papineau]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"family compact\"]\r\n\r\nOn December 22, the British Parliament received the news of rebellion in\r\nLower Canada. The distress occasioned by the financial panic of this year\r\nin the United States had spread to Canada. It found vent in agitation\r\nagainst English rule on the part of the French Canadians. On the occasion\r\nof the announcement of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne, when Te\r\nDeums were sung in the churches, the French Canadians signified their\r\ndisapproval by walking out of church. Louis Joseph Papineau, Speaker of the\r\nLower House, led the opposition to the government proposals regarding the\r\napplication of the revenues of the province. The home government kept up a\r\nnarrow \"British party\" devoted to the so-called interests of the mother\r\ncountry. The majority in the Legislative Council constantly thwarted the\r\nresolutions of the vast majority of the popular Assembly. In Upper Canada,\r\na British and official class practically held within its control the\r\ngovernment of the province. This class became known as the \"family\r\ncompact.\" The public offices and lands were parcelled out among themselves\r\nand their followers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supplies refused]\r\n\r\nThe immediate points in dispute in 1837 were, that the government retained\r\nin its service certain officials contrary to the wishes of the\r\nRepresentative Assembly, and insisted on paying their salaries out of\r\ncolonial funds. The Representative Assembly declined to furnish the\r\nsupplies, complained of arbitrary infringement of the Constitution, and\r\ndemanded that the Legislative Council, instead of being nominees of the\r\nCrown, should be made elective.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Russell's measures]\r\n\r\nWhen intelligence reached England that the Assembly obstinately refused\r\nsupplies for the payment of public officials, and of the arrears, which up\r\nto that time amounted to nearly one hundred and fifty thousand pounds\r\nsterling, Lord John Russell carried in the English House of Commons a\r\nseries of resolutions rejecting the demand for an elective legislative\r\ncouncil and other changes in the Constitution, and empowering the executive\r\ngovernment to defray the expenses of the public service out of the\r\nterritorial and casual revenues.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fils de la Liberté]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mackenzie]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American filibusters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sinking of \"Carolina\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Major Head's measures]\r\n\r\nOn November 6, the so-called \"Fils de la Liberté\" rose in Montreal under\r\nthe leadership of Papineau. In Upper Canada, a similar rising was headed by\r\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie, a journalist. On December 4, an attempt was made to\r\nsurprise Montreal. With the help of the militia the insurgents were\r\ndefeated, on December 4, at St. Eustace. The leaders of the insurrection at\r\nToronto fled to the United States and persuaded Van Rensselaer with other\r\ncitizens of Buffalo to join them. On December 12, they seized Navy Island\r\nin Niagara River, established a provisional government, and issued paper\r\nmoney. Loyalists of Canada attempted in vain to capture the place. On\r\nDecember 29, they attacked the steamer \"Carolina\" and sent her over the\r\nFalls, resulting in the loss of several lives. This incident caused great\r\nexcitement, both in England and this country. President Van Buren issued a\r\nproclamation of neutrality forbidding all interference in Canada, and sent\r\nGeneral Wool with a military force to compel obedience to the proclamation.\r\nIn Upper Canada, Major Head--afterward Sir Francis Head--undertook to\r\nsuppress the rebellion by throwing the Canadians on their honor. Trusting\r\nto the good will of the people, he sent all the regular soldiers out of the\r\nprovince to the assistance of Governor Gosford in Lower Canada. The plan\r\nworked well. The Canadians, proud of the confidence reposed in them,\r\nenrolled themselves in the militia to the number of ten or twelve thousand,\r\nand when Mackenzie and the rebels assembled to show fight, they were routed\r\nat the first encounter, and the rebellion in Upper Canada was at once\r\nsuppressed. But Major Head's policy was not approved by the British\r\nGovernment, and Head had to make way for Lord Durham, the newly appointed\r\nGovernor of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1838\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Durham in Canada]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napierville]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prescott]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Durham repudiated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canadian interregnum]\r\n\r\nEarly in the year the Canadian insurgents and their sympathizers at Navy\r\nIsland were compelled to surrender. United States troops were posted at the\r\nfrontier. In the meanwhile Lord Durham had taken charge in Canada with\r\ndictatorial powers. He undertook to remodel the Constitution of Canada. His\r\nfirst act was a proclamation of amnesty from the Queen. The beneficent\r\neffect of this was spoiled by a clause of exceptions providing for the\r\nperpetual banishment of a number of men implicated in the recent rising. On\r\nApril 2, Lunt and Matthews, two conspicuous rebels, were hanged. Lord\r\nDurham's confession that his measures were illegal evoked a storm in\r\nParliament. Lord Brougham, who had a personal quarrel with him, led the\r\nopposition there. In Canada, Mackenzie promptly proclaimed a republic. On\r\nJune 5, a fight between the rebels and British troops near Toronto quelled\r\nthe rebellion for a short time. Within a few months it broke out again at\r\nBeauharnais. A pitched battle was fought at Napierville early in November.\r\nAfter their defeat there, the rebels made another stand at Prescott on\r\nNovember 17, but suffered so crushing a defeat that the insurrection was\r\nbelieved to have been ended. In the meanwhile, Lord Brougham had succeeded\r\nin passing a bill through the House disapproving Lord Durham's measures.\r\nDurham, he said, had been authorized to make a general law, but not to hang\r\nmen without the form of law. To save his own Administration Lord Melbourne\r\non the next day announced that the Cabinet had decided to disallow Durham's\r\nexpatriation ordinances. Durham was called upon to proclaim to the\r\nrebellious colonists that the ordinance issued by him had been condemned by\r\nhis own government. Venting his mortification in a last indignant\r\nproclamation, he quitted Canada without waiting for his recall. By the\r\nexpress orders of the government the honors usually paid to a\r\nGovernor-General were withheld from him. Lord Durham returned to England a\r\nbroken-hearted and dying man. He was succeeded by Sir John Colbourne. His\r\nfirst measure was to offer a reward of £1,000 for the apprehension of\r\nPapineau. The storm of indignation that followed was so violent that\r\nColbourne incontinently threw up his post, and hastened back to England.\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Fur Company improved the interval of the interregnum to\r\nmonopolize the functions of government in the vast regions of the extreme\r\nnorth of America. An expedition was sent out to explore the northernmost\r\ncoast. The United States also fitted out an Antarctic exploring expedition,\r\nconsisting of six vessels, under the command of Lieutenant Wilkes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renewed agitation in England]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: People's Charter]\r\n\r\nIn the British Parliament, the question of the adoption of the ballot was\r\nraised by Duncombe, but Lord John Russell spoke against it, stating that\r\nthe majority of the people were against fresh changes, or any renewal of\r\nthe agitating circumstances which preceded the Reform Bill. But twenty\r\nmembers voted with Duncombe, of whom six were asked to meet six members of\r\nthe Workingmen's Association to discuss a programme of action. At that\r\nmeeting a document in the shape of a Parliamentary petition was prepared\r\ncontaining \"six points,\" which were: Universal suffrage, or the right of\r\nvoting by every male of twenty-one years of age; vote by ballot; annual\r\nParliaments; abolition of the property qualification for members of\r\nParliament; members of Parliament to be paid for their services; equal\r\nelectoral districts. At the conclusion of the meeting, Daniel O'Connell\r\nrose and handed the petition to the secretary of the Workingmen's\r\nAssociation, saying, \"There, Lovett, is your Charter. Agitate for it and\r\nnever be content with anything else.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Feargus O'Connor]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chartist leaders]\r\n\r\nThe \"People's Charter\" was submitted to a large public meeting and\r\nenthusiastically approved, and the leaders of the movement began to\r\norganize. They soon fell into two factions; those who were in favor of\r\nforce and those in favor of agitation only. The leader of both parties was\r\nFeargus O'Connor, an Irish barrister, and once a follower of O'Connell,\r\nwith whom he subsequently quarrelled. Associated with him as leaders of the\r\nmovement at various periods were Lovett, Heatherington, Henry Vincent,\r\nErnest Jones, and Thomas Cooper \"the poet of Chartism.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: QUEEN VICTORIA TAKING THE OATH\r\n    Painted by Sir George Hayter]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French expedition to Mexico]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coast towns bombarded]\r\n\r\nIn France, the sympathies of the people with the cause of the French\r\nCanadians were kept under firm control by the government of Louis\r\nPhilippe. A dissolution of the Chambers, which modified the condition of\r\nthe Assembly, served to strengthen the Ministry of Molé. To vent the\r\nfeelings excited in behalf of the Frenchmen of Canada, the French\r\nGovernment picked a quarrel with the Republic of Mexico. Reparation was\r\ndemanded late in March for injuries inflicted on French residents during\r\nthe internal dissensions of Mexico. The demand was refused. A French\r\nsquadron of warships, under Admiral Baudin and Prince de Joinville, was\r\nsent out to blockade the coast of Mexico. On November 27, San Juan de Ulloa\r\nwas bombarded. Vera Cruz likewise suffered bombardment. The Argentine\r\nRepublic became involved and declared war on France. French cruisers\r\nblockaded Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon returns]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexandre Dumas]\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of his mother's death, Prince Louis Napoleon returned to\r\nEurope. His book, \"Idées Napoléoniennes,\" which was widely read throughout\r\nFrance, at once drew attention upon him. At the request of the French\r\nGovernment he was expelled from Switzerland. Louis Philippe's friend,\r\nAlexandre Dumas, at this time achieved a popular success with his book \"Le\r\nCapitaine Paul.\" Dumas's romantic plays and several of his latest comedies,\r\nwritten in the style of Scribe, were at the height of their vogue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daubigny]\r\n\r\nIn the French salon of this year, François Daubigny, the great pupil of\r\nDelaroche, first exhibited his early masterpieces, \"Banks of the River\r\nOulins\" and \"The Seine at Charenton.\" Both paintings were purchased by the\r\nFrench Government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poe]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hawthorne]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emerson]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wendell Phillips]\r\n\r\nIn America, a new writer had arisen in Edgar Allan Poe, who disputed the\r\nfield with Longfellow and Whittier. Poe's \"Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym,\"\r\na story of marine adventures, which had begun in Poe's own journal, \"The\r\nMessenger,\" was published in complete form by Harpers. Before this several\r\nof his works, among them that of \"Ligeia,\" had already brought him into\r\nsome prominence. Nathaniel Hawthorne during this same year wrote his early\r\nstories, which were afterward collected under the title of \"Twice Told\r\nTales.\" Ralph Waldo Emerson at Concord, Massachusetts, had begun to deliver\r\nthose penetrating lectures which, rewritten in the form of essays, later\r\nestablished his rank as the foremost philosophic writer in America. Wendell\r\nPhillips made his appearance as a lecturer against slavery in Boston.\r\nShortly before this a pro-slavery mob at Alton, Illinois, murdered the Rev.\r\nE.P. Lovejoy and destroyed the press and building of his newspaper,\r\npublished in the interests of abolition. Abraham Lincoln, who had been\r\nre-elected to the Legislature of Illinois, voiced a strong protest against\r\nthis and other pro-slavery tendencies in Illinois.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Removal of Cherokees]\r\n\r\nOther acts of persecution during this year brought lasting disgrace upon\r\nAmerica. In direct violation of the Federal treaties with the Indians the\r\nState troops of Georgia forcibly removed 16,000 Cherokees from their lands\r\nin that State. Nothing was done to alleviate the sufferings of the\r\nCherokees, who were driven from their settlements in midwinter. The\r\nresulting death rate was fearful. More than 4,500 Indians, or one-fourth\r\nof the whole number, perished before they reached their destination in the\r\ndistant Indian Territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Persecution of Mormons]\r\n\r\nThe members of the new sect of Mormon, numbering some 12,000 souls, were\r\ndriven from their homes at Nauvoo in western Missouri. They went across the\r\nplains of Iowa, stopping temporarily at Council Bluffs. From there they\r\npassed over the great American prairies, and, crossing the Rocky Mountain\r\nrange, settled near the Great Salt Lake of Utah.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Record transatlantic trip]\r\n\r\nChicago was incorporated with a population of 4,170 residents. Much comment\r\nwas excited by a record trip of the steamboat \"Great Western,\" which\r\nsteamed from Bristol, England, to New York in fifteen days. Among those who\r\nlived to witness this event was John Stevens, one of the pioneers of modern\r\nsteamboat building. Shortly afterward he died in his eighty-ninth year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indian truce broken]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Betrayal of Osceola]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zachary Taylor in Florida]\r\n\r\nWithin a short time after suing for peace, the Southern Indians broke the\r\ntruce and made a determined effort to take Fort Mellon. In this they were\r\nunsuccessful. In March, at Fort Dade, five of the chiefs signed an\r\nagreement, in which they stipulated to cease from war until the government\r\ndecided whether they might remain in Florida. Some seven hundred Indians\r\nand negroes were taken by the government before its decision was announced,\r\nand were sent off to Tampa for shipment. In violation of a flag of truce,\r\nOsceola and several of his principal chiefs were seized and sent to Fort\r\nMoultrie as prisoners. Their treatment there was such that Osceola soon\r\ndied. In May, Colonel Zachary Taylor succeeded Jesup. The remaining forces\r\nof the Indians were now wary. They scattered in the swamps, eluding\r\nattempts of organized troops to capture them. In December, Colonel Taylor\r\nset out with over a thousand men for their almost inaccessible haunts. On\r\nChristmas Day they found the Seminoles prepared to receive them near\r\nOkeechobee Lake. After a hard fought battle, in which Taylor lost 139 men,\r\nthe Indians once more retreated into the swamps of Florida.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boers in Natal]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pretorius]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa during this year, the new community of Dutch settlers, who\r\nhad evaded English jurisdiction, soon revived their peculiar institutions\r\nin the region that is now Natal--from the Drakensberg to the sea at Durban,\r\nand from the Tugela River to the Umzimbolbu. The fight against the African\r\nsavages continued. Early in the spring, a Boer expedition was defeated by\r\nthe Zulus, who followed up their advantage by an attack on the nearest Boer\r\nlaager. Seventy Boers, with their Kaffir servants, were massacred. A large\r\nBoer settlement, numbering some 800 persons, was saved from extermination\r\nonly by a timely relief expedition under Pretorius, in December. On the\r\nother side troubles arose between the Boers and the Bechuanas in\r\nconsequence of King Moroka's prohibition of the importation of spirituous\r\nliquors into Bechuanaland. The growth of a new Dutch State to the north of\r\nCape Colony caused uneasiness among the British authorities at Cape Town. A\r\nmovement was started to extend British rule to Natal, and to secure the\r\nimportant seaport of Durban.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1839\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French hold on Mexico]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ancona evacuated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Status of Belgium]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Molé's Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French provincial government]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parisian revolt suppressed]\r\n\r\nThe French expedition against Mexico was brought to a successful close\r\nafter the capture of the fort of San Juan d'Ulloa and the town of Vera\r\nCruz. General Santa Anna's attempt to relieve Vera Cruz resulted only in\r\nanother upheaval of the government at the capital. President Bustamente had\r\nto call in a new Ministry, with which, through the mediation of England,\r\nnegotiations for peace were undertaken. On March 9, the terms of peace were\r\nconcluded. Mexico had to pay an indemnity of $600,000. Further use for the\r\nFrench squadron in American waters was found in the complicated affairs of\r\nthe small South American republics at the mouth of the Plata and the\r\nalleged injuries suffered by Frenchmen from the disordered state of affairs\r\nin Hayti. On the other hand, France withdrew its troops from the citadel of\r\nAncona in the Papal dominions, simultaneously with the withdrawal of the\r\nAustrian forces of occupation from the Papal States. The long-pending\r\ndifficulties between Belgium and Holland were brought to a settlement at\r\nlast by the King of Holland's acceptance of the conditions of separation\r\nfixed by the international conference. The abandonment of Casimir Périer's\r\nvigorous foreign policy in Europe was viewed with regret by the Liberal\r\nparty in France. Guizot combined with Thiers and Odilon Barrot against the\r\nMinistry, and thus accomplished its downfall, though they retained Marshal\r\nSoult, the most popular member of Molé's Cabinet. \"I must have that gallant\r\nsword,\" remarked Louis Philippe. Their efforts to conduct the government\r\nproved a failure. The King established a provisional government in their\r\nplace, which prolonged the crisis. On May 12, an insurrection broke out in\r\nthe most populous quarters of Paris. Under the leadership of Barbes,\r\nBernard and others, attacks were made on the Hôtel de Ville, the Palace of\r\nJustice and the Préfecture of Police. The revolt had to be put down by\r\nmerciless measures. Marshal Soult was placed at the head of the government\r\nto the exclusion of Guizot and Odilon Barrot, while Thiers was made\r\npresident of the Chambers. Guizot employed his leisure time to write his\r\nfamous \"Life of Washington.\" About the same time Daguerre published his new\r\ninvention of making the sun prints which were called daguerreotypes after\r\nhim. A life pension of 6,000 francs was awarded to him by the government of\r\nLouis Philippe. The interest in the family of Bonaparte and its dreaded\r\npretensions in France was revived by the death of Letizia Buonaparte, the\r\nmother of Napoleon, in her eighty-ninth year. The first problem confronting\r\nthe new administration of France was the fresh trouble that had broken out\r\nin the Orient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish-Egyptian War]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Nissiv]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abdul Medjid, Sultan]\r\n\r\nThe long-brewing war between Sultan Mahmoud of Turkey and his vassal,\r\nMehemet Ali of Egypt, broke out in May. In the face of new assurances of\r\npeace, the Sultan ordered his commander-in-chief of the Euphrates to\r\ncommence hostilities. The Turkish troops crossed the Euphrates on May 23.\r\nIn spite of the good counsels of Moltke and other European officers at the\r\nTurkish headquarters, the Turks were outmanoeuvred by the Egyptian forces\r\nunder Ibrahim. June 24, Ibrahim Pasha inflicted a crushing defeat on the\r\nTurkish army at Nissiv. All the artillery and stores fell into his hands.\r\nThe Turkish army dispersed in another rout. Mahmoud II. did not live to\r\nhear of the disaster. One week after the battle of Nissiv, before news from\r\nthe front had reached him, he died. The throne was left to his son, Abdul\r\nMedjid, a youth of sixteen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish fleet betrayed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anglo-French intervention]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French diplomacy offset]\r\n\r\nScarcely had the new Sultan been proclaimed when the Turkish admiral,\r\nAchmet Fevzi, who had been sent out to attack the coast of Syria, sailed\r\ninto Alexandria and delivered his fleet over to Mehemet Ali. Turkey, now\r\npractically rulerless, was left without defence, on land and on water.\r\nMehemet Ali not only declared Egypt independent of the Porte, but,\r\nencouraged by France, prepared to move on Constantinople. In this extremity\r\nthe foreign Ambassadors at Constantinople addressed a collective note to\r\nthe Divan, announcing European intervention. Shortly afterward a squadron\r\nof British and French warships sailed into the Dardanelles for the\r\nostensible purpose of protecting Constantinople against Mehemet Ali, in\r\nreality to prevent Russia from profiting by the terms of its treaty of\r\nUnkiar Skelessi. In vain did Russia propose to join the coalition. The\r\nrecent acquisition of Aden gave England the upper hand. Russian diplomacy\r\naccordingly directed itself toward effecting a breach between the allies. A\r\ngood opening was afforded by the French intrigues at Cairo, which fell in\r\nwith the ambitions of Mehemet Ali. As a result, France was gradually\r\ncrowded out of the European coalition during the course of 1839.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decamps]\r\n\r\nAt the French Salon of this year Decamps exhibited his celebrated\r\n\"Punishment of the Hooks,\" \"Executioners at the Door of a Prison,\" and\r\n\"Children Playing with Turtles.\" Decamps with Delacroix, the leader of the\r\nFrench school of romanticism, was praised at this time for the exceeding\r\ncharm of his colors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of English Conservatives]\r\n\r\nEngland during this period passed through a Cabinet crisis. The popularity\r\nof Melbourne's Ministry was waning. Lord Melbourne was a typical Whig,\r\nopposed to the policy of the Tories, or, as they were beginning to be\r\ncalled at that time, the Conservatives. The alteration in title is\r\nattributed to John Wilson Croker, who, in the \"Quarterly Review,\" referred\r\nto \"what is called the Tory, but which might with more propriety be called\r\nthe Conservative party.\" This new name was indorsed by Lord John Russell,\r\nwho said, \"If that is the name that pleases them, if they say that the old\r\ndistinction of Whig and Tory should no longer be kept up, I am ready, in\r\nopposition to their name of Conservative, to take the name of Reformer,\r\nand to stand by that opposition.\" Sir Robert Peel defined Conservatism when\r\nhe said, \"My object for some years past has been to lay the foundation of a\r\ngreat party, which, existing in the House of Commons, and deriving its\r\nstrength from the popular will, should diminish the risk and deaden the\r\nshock of collisions between the two branches of the legislature.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Melbourne Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bedchamber question]\r\n\r\nIn May, the government's proposition to suspend the Constitution of Jamaica\r\nbrought about the fall of the Ministry. The measure was sustained by a\r\nmajority of only five. The Queen sent for Sir Robert Peel. Her wish to\r\nretain as ladies of her household the wife and sister of two members of the\r\nlast Cabinet brought forth a respectful remonstrance from Peel. The Queen\r\nreplied in this wise: \"The Queen having considered the proposal made to her\r\nyesterday by Sir Robert Peel, to remove the Ladies of her Bedchamber,\r\ncannot consent to a course which she considers to be contrary to usage, and\r\nis repugnant to her feelings.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Victoria yields]\r\n\r\nThis ended Peel's attempt to form a Ministry and Melbourne was recalled.\r\nThe question created much discussion at the time. Lord Brougham maintained\r\nthat Lord Melbourne \"had sacrificed liberal principles and the interests of\r\nthe country to the private feelings of the sovereign.\" \"I thought,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that we belonged to a country in which the government by the Crown\r\nand the wisdom of Parliament was everything, and the personal feelings of\r\nthe sovereign were absolutely not to be named at the same time.\" In the\r\nend the Queen yielded her point. A statement was put forth that \"the Queen\r\nwould listen to any representation from the incoming Prime Minister as to\r\nthe composition of her household, and would arrange for the retirement, of\r\ntheir own accord, of any ladies who were so closely related to the leaders\r\nof Opposition as to render their presence inconvenient.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chartist agitation]\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the Chartists large public meetings were organized in London\r\nand in all parts of England at which violent speeches were made. On the 1st\r\nof April, at a public meeting in Edinburgh to support the Ministry, the\r\nChartists took possession of the platform, ejected the Lord Provost, and\r\npassed their own resolutions. On the same day at Devizes, in Wiltshire,\r\nVincent entered the town at the head of about a thousand men, carrying\r\nsticks, and attempted to address them in the market-place. In May, the\r\nChartist National Convention removed from London to Birmingham. There they\r\nwere met by a mob of five thousand persons and conducted through the\r\nprincipal streets to the meeting-place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese oppose opium trade]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English opium destroyed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British resentment]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese orders defied]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opening of hostilities]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sea fight off Chuenpee]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British squadron sails for China]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Great Britain was embroiled in another Oriental war. The\r\ndespatch of Admiral Maitland and Captain Elliot to China to deal with the\r\ndifficulties growing out of the English opium trade there only served to\r\nmake the situation more acute. In January, Emperor Taouk-Wang ordered Lin\r\nTsiaseu, Viceroy of Houk Wang, to proceed to Canton to put a definite stop\r\nto the opium traffic. The peremptory instructions given to Commissioner\r\nLin were \"to cut off the fountain of evil, and if necessary to sink the\r\nBritish ships and to break their caldrons, since the hourly thought on the\r\nEmperor's part was to do away with opium forever.\" Within a week of Lin's\r\narrival at Canton he issued an edict wherein he stigmatized the foreigners\r\nas a heartless people who thought only of trade and of making their way by\r\nstealth into the Flowery Land, whereas the laws of England, he asserted,\r\nprohibited the smoking of opium in their own country. A demand was made to\r\nsurrender to him all stores of opium within three days. To enforce this\r\ndemand, Chinese troops were concentrated around the European settlement.\r\nEventually more than 20,000 chests of opium were seized and dumped into the\r\nsea. After this triumph, Lin wrote a letter to Queen Victoria calling upon\r\nher government to interdict the importation of opium. At the same time a\r\nmemorial was sent to England by the British merchants of Canton begging the\r\ngovernment to protect them against \"a capricious and corrupt government\"\r\nand demanding compensation for the opium confiscated by the Chinese. On the\r\npart of the British Government no answer was vouchsafed to the demands of\r\nthe viceroy. In China, matters took their course. Captain Elliot at Canton,\r\non May 22, issued a notice in which he protested against the action of the\r\nChinese Government \"as utterly unjust per se,\" and advised all British\r\nmerchants to withdraw to Hong Kong. The merchants acted on the suggestion,\r\nand the English factory at Canton, which had existed for nearly 200 years,\r\nwas abandoned. The British sailors in Chinese waters threw off all\r\nrestraint. Frequent collisions occurred between them and the natives. In\r\none of them a Chinaman was killed. The Chinese viceroy denounced this act\r\nas \"going to the extreme of disobedience to the laws\" and demanded the\r\nsurrender of the British sailor who perpetrated the murder. This demand was\r\nflatly refused. The Chinese thereupon refused to furnish further supplies\r\nto the ships and prohibited all British sailors from coming ashore on\r\nChinese soil. The official notice said: \"If any of the foreigners be found\r\ncoming on shore to cause trouble, all and every one of the people are\r\npermitted to withstand and drive them back, or to make prisoners of them.\"\r\nThe English naval officers retaliated by sending out their men to seize by\r\nforce whatever they needed. A boat's crew of the British ship \"Black Jack\"\r\nwas massacred. Thus hostilities began. Two British men-of-war exchanged\r\nshots with the forts in the Bogue. On November 3, the two frigates \"Volage\"\r\nand \"Hyacinth\" were attacked by twenty-nine junks-of-war off Chuenpee. A\r\nregular engagement was fought and four of the junks were sunk. On the news\r\nof the fight at Chuenpee, Emperor Taouk-Wang promoted the Chinese admiral.\r\nOn December 6, an imperial edict prohibiting all trade with Great Britain\r\nwas issued. Already a strong British squadron was on its way to China.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with Afghans]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Kandahar]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British enter Kabul]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of Russian counter move]\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with these troubles the British had become embroiled in war\r\nwith the Afghans. The ostensible purpose was to depose Dost Mohammed Khan\r\nfrom his usurpation of the throne of Afghanistan. In reality this chieftain\r\nhad aroused the ire of England by entering into negotiations with Russia,\r\nafter Lord Auckland had declined to call upon Runjit Singh to restore\r\nPeshawar to Afghanistan. When it was learned that a Russian mission had\r\nbeen received at Kabul, the British Government resolved to dethrone Dost\r\nMohammed Khan and to restore Shah Shuja to the throne of Kabul. War was\r\ndeclared at Simla. Columns were sent out from Bombay and Bengal and were\r\nunited at Quetta under the command of Sir John Keene. Kandahar was captured\r\nin April. In July, Ghasni was taken by storm. It was on this occasion that\r\nSir Henry Durand, then a young subaltern, distinguished himself by blowing\r\nup the Ghasni gate. In August, the British entered Kabul. Dost Mohammed\r\nKhan fled over the Oxus into Bokhara. Shah Shuja was restored as ruler of\r\nAfghanistan under the tutelage of a British resident minister. In response\r\nto Dost Mohammed's appeals, the Russian Government sent out an expedition\r\ntoward Khiva, in November; but the winter weather in the mountains was so\r\nsevere that the expedition had to return.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British colonial problems]\r\n\r\nOther problems engaged the attention of the British Colonial Office. A\r\nrebellion in Borneo had to be suppressed by force of arms. In Canada, the\r\nnew Governor-General, Charles Pollot Thompson, later Lord Sydenham, found\r\nit difficult to carry out Durham's scheme of union. In November, martial\r\nlaw had to be declared again at Montreal. The reported discovery of gold\r\nby Count Strzelescki in New South Wales, and the discovery of copper in\r\nSouth Australia, drew great numbers of emigrants thither. New Zealand was\r\nincorporated in New South Wales. The wild financial speculations engendered\r\nby these changes plunged almost all of Australia into bankruptcy. In Cape\r\nColony the public school system was introduced by Sir W. Herschel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Industrial development]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles Darwin]\r\n\r\nIn England, it was a period of material advances in civilization. Postal\r\nreforms were introduced by Sir Roland Hill. In July, a bill for penny\r\npostage was introduced in Parliament, resulting in a new postage law\r\nproviding a uniform rate of fourpence per letter. New speed records were\r\nmade on land and on water. While the steam packet \"Britannia\" crossed from\r\nHalifax to Liverpool in ten days, the locomotive \"North Star\" accomplished\r\na run of thirty-seven miles in one hour. Wheatstone perfected his invention\r\nof a telegraph clock. A patent was obtained for the process of obtaining\r\nwater gas. Charles Darwin, having returned from his scientific travels on\r\nH.M.S. \"Beagle,\" published his \"Journal of Researches.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Schelling]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Agassiz]\r\n\r\nA loss to German philosophic literature was the death of Joseph Schelling,\r\nwhose theories formed the main inspiration of the romantic poet Novalis.\r\nAgassiz, the naturalist, published his original researches on fresh-water\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schwann's cell theory]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liebig's theory of fermentation]\r\n\r\nIt was then that Dr. Theodore Schwann, stimulated in his microscopic\r\nresearches by the previous discoveries of Robert Brown, Johannes Müller\r\nand Schleiden, propounded the famous cell theory in his work, \"Microscopic\r\nResearches Concerning the Unity in the Structure and Growth of Animals and\r\nPlants.\" Schwann's book became a scientific classic almost from the moment\r\nof its publication. It was Schwann, too, who, simultaneously with Cagniard\r\nla Tour, discovered the active principle of gastric juice to be the\r\nsubstance which he named pepsin. The cell theory was for some time combated\r\nby the most eminent German men of science. Thus Liebig, in apparent\r\nagreement with Helmholtz, took a firm stand against the new doctrine with\r\nhis famous \"theory of fermentation\" promulgated this same year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of William Smith]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new geology]\r\n\r\nIn England, William Smith, \"the father of English geology,\" died. Born in\r\n1769, Smith, like many another English scientist, was self-taught and\r\nperhaps all the more independent for that. He discovered that the fossils\r\nin rocks, instead of being scattered haphazard, are arranged in regular\r\nsystems, so that any given stratum of rock is labelled by its fossil\r\npopulation; that the order of succession of such groups of fossils is\r\nalways the same in any vertical series of strata in which they occur, and\r\nthat a fossil, having once disappeared, never reappears in a later stratum.\r\nThe facts which he unearthed were as iconoclastic in their field as the\r\ndiscoveries of Copernicus and Galileo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish civil war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carlist reverses]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of Don Carlos]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of Spain]\r\n\r\nIn Spain, a signal defeat of the Carlists at Pennecerrada during the\r\nprevious year had caused a decisive turn in the civil war. Don Carlos'\r\nattempted march on Madrid had to be abandoned, and was followed by the\r\nretreat of his forces to the Ebro. General Espartero forced back the\r\nCarlist forces step by step, and carried the fight into the Basque\r\nprovinces. There the struggle degenerated into a war of extermination. The\r\nCarlist leaders turned against one another. The priests excommunicated the\r\ngenerals, and the generals in turn shot the priests. At last, by the middle\r\nof September, so many of the insurgents had surrendered to Espartero that\r\nDon Carlos found himself almost without followers. He gave up the struggle\r\nand fled into France. This ended the civil war. It had lasted six weary\r\nyears, and had proved almost as disastrous for Spain as the great\r\nPeninsular War. Robbed of her former colonial resources, excepting only\r\nthose from Cuba and the Philippines, Spain's finances were all but ruined.\r\nOf industrial progress there was next to none. The country relapsed into\r\nsemi-barbarism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American Whig Convention]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry Clay's candidacy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial failures]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Longfellow's poems]\r\n\r\nIn the United States, prominent Northern abolitionists met at Warsaw, New\r\nYork, and resolved to form an independent political party. A Whig\r\nConvention, the first of such gatherings, was held at Harrisburg, fifteen\r\nmonths before the next Presidential election. Harrison was nominated for\r\nPresident and John Tyler for Vice-President. In the West, Henry Clay,\r\npopularly known as \"Harry of the West,\" was the ideal of a strong minority.\r\nHis repeated failures to attain the Presidency led to the remark: \"He is\r\ntoo good a man to be President.\" The first session of the Twenty-sixth\r\nCongress opened in December. An organization of the House was at last\r\neffected by John Quincy Adams, who put a question to vote which the\r\nSpeaker had refused to present. The Representatives indulged for the first\r\ntime in the practice of \"pairing off.\" Adams opposed this, declaring that\r\nit was a violation of the Constitution, of an express rule of the House\r\nwhich the Representatives owed to their constituents. Another event of the\r\nyear in America was the failure of the United States Bank at Philadelphia,\r\nin consequence of speculations in cotton, as the result of which the\r\ngovernment lost $2,000,000 of its deposits. Other bank failures followed.\r\nMississippi repudiated $5,000,000 of its State bonds. The first power loom\r\nfor making carpets was set up at Lowell, Massachusetts. Charles Goodyear\r\nobtained his first patent for making vulcanized rubber. The express\r\nbusiness was organized by Harndon, who sent his first pack from New York to\r\nBoston by the public messenger. Longfellow published his romance\r\n\"Hyperion,\" and \"Voices of the Night,\" a collection of verses embracing\r\nsome of his most widely known poems. In the same year appeared Willis's\r\n\"Letters from Under a Bridge\" and Cooper's \"History of the Navy.\"\r\n\r\nToward the close of the year, Queen Victoria held a Privy Council at\r\nBuckingham Palace, at which she announced her intention to marry her\r\ncousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Victoria's betrothal]\r\n\r\nGreville wrote in his diary that \"about eighty Privy Councillors were\r\npresent, the folding-doors were thrown open, and the Queen came in, attired\r\nin a plain morning gown, but wearing a necklace containing Prince Albert's\r\nportrait. She read the declaration in a clear, sonorous, sweet tone of\r\nvoice, but her hand trembled so excessively that I wonder she was able to\r\nread the paper which she held.\"\r\n\r\nAll this time the agitation for the People's Charter in England went on\r\nunabated. In the autumn, St. Paul's Cathedral in London was temporarily\r\ntaken possession of by a large body of Chartists. Churches were likewise\r\nentered in Manchester.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Popular riots in England]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Charter propaganda]\r\n\r\nAt Newport, in Monmouthshire, an organized attempt was made, under the\r\nleadership of John Frost and Zephaniah Williams, to rescue Henry Vincent\r\nfrom prison. Armed with guns, crowbars and pick-axes the mob poured into\r\nthe town twenty thousand strong. They were met by a small body of soldiery,\r\nand after a sharp conflict were scattered with a loss of ten killed and\r\nfifty wounded. The leaders were arrested and condemned in court. A vast\r\nperiodical literature kept alive the agitation. Among the new Chartist\r\nnewspapers were the \"Northern Star,\" the property and the organ of Feargus\r\nO'Connor; the London \"Despatch\"; the Edinburgh \"New Scotsman\"; the\r\nNewcastle \"Northern Liberator\"; the Birmingham \"Journal,\" and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1840\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: England declares war on China]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese edict prohibiting all trade and intercourse with England was\r\nput in force on January 5. The English missionaries in China fled to Hong\r\nKong, which port was put in readiness for defence against the Chinese.\r\nGreat Britain declared war, and sent out an expedition consisting of 4,000\r\ntroops on board twenty-five transports, with a convoy of fifteen\r\nmen-of-war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Dingaan]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, during January, the Boers inflicted a crushing defeat on\r\nthe Zulus under Dingaan. The Zulu King himself was killed. His brother,\r\nUpanda, succeeded him as ruler.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Union of Upper and Lower Canada]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canadian boundary commission]\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the globe, the legislative union of Upper and Lower\r\nCanada was at last effected, after a separation of forty-nine years. Each\r\nhad equal representation in the common legislature, with practical\r\nconcession on the part of the mother country of responsible government.\r\nKingston was selected as the new seat of government, to be shifted\r\npresently to Montreal. To settle the long pending boundary dispute between\r\nCanada and the United States, a commission was appointed, consisting of\r\nLord Ashburton for England and Daniel Webster for America. Between the line\r\nclaimed by Great Britain and that demanded by the United States lay 12,000\r\nsquare miles of territory. The commission sat all the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American Presidential election]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morse]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Draper]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Florence]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fanny Ellsler]\r\n\r\nThe American Senate early in the year passed the Sub-Treasury bill. By this\r\nmeasure it was required that the national funds should be kept at\r\nWashington, and in federal sub-treasuries in some of the large cities,\r\nsubject to the orders of the Washington office. The first National\r\nConvention against anti-slavery met at Albany. James G. Birney, a\r\nKentuckian, was nominated for President. The Whigs were incensed at the\r\nnomination and Birney withdrew. The Democratic National Convention at\r\nBaltimore unanimously renominated Van Buren. The political campaign that\r\nfollowed began a new era in American elections. The facilities of transit\r\neffected by the railroads now first rendered possible immense gatherings at\r\ncentral points. In May, 20,000 political followers gathered at Baltimore in\r\nHarrison's interest. The contest had just opened, when a leading Democratic\r\npaper stated \"if some one would present Harrison with a barrel of cider he\r\nwould sit down on a log content and happy the rest of his days.\" The log\r\ncabin and hard cider jug forthwith became the emblems of the Whigs. Log\r\ncabin songs were heard, with shouts for \"Tippecanoe, and Tyler too.\" All\r\nthe Middle States gave their majorities to Harrison. Harrison and Tyler\r\nwere elected by a vote of 1,275,017 to 1,128,702 for Van Buren. It was a\r\npolitical revolution, breaking the Democratic success of forty years. It\r\nwas during this year that Samuel F.B. Morse obtained his first American\r\npatent on the telegraph. William Draper of New York turned out the most\r\nsuccessful daguerreotype portraits yet obtained. Florence, the actor, made\r\nhis first appearance at the National Theatre in Philadelphia, while Fanny\r\nEllsler appeared at the Park Theatre in New York City. Ralph Waldo Emerson\r\npublished the \"Dial.\" Other notable publications in American letters were\r\nPoe's \"Tales of the Arabesque and Grotesque,\" Willis's \"Loiterings of\r\nTravel,\" Cooper's \"Pathfinder,\" and Dana's \"Two Years Before the Mast.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New Mexico]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Yucatan]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Mexico]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dom Pedro II. of Brazil]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Lavalle shot]\r\n\r\nIn Central and South America, it was likewise a year of political\r\nupheavals. The Yankee settlers of Texas maintained their independence\r\nagainst Mexico. Their movement was joined by the Northern States along the\r\nRio Grande. The independent State of New Mexico was formed. Yucatan\r\nlikewise became an independent government. On July 25, a revolution broke\r\nout in the City of Mexico. General Urrea captured in person President\r\nBustamente. After two days Bustamente was released on a pledge of general\r\namnesty and administrative reforms. Santander, the first President of\r\nColombia, died in May. The election of Marquez to the Presidency was\r\nfollowed by civil war. The province of Cartagena seceded from Colombia. The\r\nunion of Central American States was dissolved, and Costa Rica became an\r\nindependent republic. In Brazil, another political overturn resulted in\r\nmaterial changes in the Constitution. In July, the Brazilian Legislature\r\ndeclared Dom Pedro II., then still under age, Emperor of Brazil. In the\r\nArgentine Republic, General Lavalle, who had taken the field against his\r\nopponents, was utterly defeated and shot. A new treaty was concluded\r\nbetween Argentina and Montevideo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hawaiian Islands recognized]\r\n\r\nIn the distant South Seas, the Hawaiian Islands were recognized as an\r\nindependent kingdom by the Powers on the condition that free access be\r\ngiven to white missionaries and the teachings of Christianity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oriental problems]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Egypt's status defined]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the affairs of the Orient, the Powers found agreement more\r\ndifficult. France gave continued support to the pretensions of Mehemet Ali\r\nof Egypt against Turkey. The French scheme to anticipate Russia's designs\r\non Constantinople by a dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire and the\r\nestablishment of Mehemet Ali at Constantinople found little favor with the\r\nPowers. The Russian statesmen understood the true weakness of Turkey, and\r\nwere willing to bide their time. Metternich and Lord Palmerston clung to\r\nthe belief that the Ottoman Empire could still be reconstructed. Thus Lord\r\nPalmerston said at this time: \"All that we hear about the decay of the\r\nTurkish Empire, and its being a dead body, or a sapless trunk, and so\r\nforth, is pure and unadulterated nonsense.\" Metternich affected to look\r\nupon Mehemet Ali as a mere rebel. At last, on July 15, the negotiators of\r\nGreat Britain, Russia, Austria and Prussia, without waiting for France,\r\nconcluded a treaty at London. Egypt was offered to Mehemet Ali in\r\nperpetuity with southern Syria for his lifetime. If this offer was not\r\naccepted within ten days, Egypt alone was to be ceded; if, after twenty\r\ndays, this alternative were not accepted, joint action was to be taken\r\nagainst Mehemet Ali.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France slighted]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French pretensions on the Rhine]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Becker's Rhine song]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Musset's defiance]\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of France from the concert of Europe aroused a storm of anger\r\nat Paris. Guizot, the French Ambassador at London, expostulated with Lord\r\nPalmerston. Thiers, then at the head of affairs in France, issued orders\r\nfor an increase of the strength of army and navy. The long-delayed\r\nfortifications at Paris were begun. Military spirit was so awakened in\r\nFrance that the familiar cry was raised to avenge Waterloo and recover the\r\nRhine. The Germans fiercely resented this threat of invasion, prompted\r\nlargely by French exasperation over the turn which Egyptian affairs had\r\ntaken. Even the Rhenish provinces, which owed so much to France, shared in\r\nthis national feeling. It was at this time that Becker, himself a man from\r\nthe Rhine, wrote the lines which in later years became one of Germany's\r\nmost famous war songs:\r\n\r\n  \"Sie sollen ihn nicht haben\r\n  Den freien deutschen Rhein.\"\r\n\r\nAlfred de Musset answered this with his defiant verses:\r\n\r\n  \"Nous avons eu votre Rhin Allemand,\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleonic memories]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon's second fiasco]\r\n\r\nUnder the stress of this new military ardor in France, agitation was\r\nrevived for the return of Napoleon Bonaparte's remains from St. Helena to\r\nFrance. The consent of the British Government having been obtained, a\r\ndecree to this effect was passed by the French Chambers. Other events\r\nhelped to fan to fresh life the smouldering flames of Napoleonic\r\nimperialism. Thus the death of Lucien Bonaparte, Napoleon's eldest\r\nbrother, and of Marshal MacDonald, hero of Wagram, recalled a host of\r\nNapoleonic memories. On August 6, Prince Louis Napoleon deemed the time\r\nripe for another Napoleonic rising. Crossing over from England with General\r\nMoltenon and fifty followers he attempted to incite an insurrection at\r\nVimereux near Boulogne. He hoped to re-enact the events after Elba. Once\r\nmore his plans ended in a fiasco. \"Bonaparte or not, I see in you only a\r\nconspirator,\" exclaimed Colonel Puygelier. The conspirators fled back to\r\ntheir boat and capsized. Louis Napoleon was taken and sentenced to life\r\nimprisonment within the fortress of Ham. As a sop to popular feeling, King\r\nLouis Philippe permitted the bronze statue of the Great Napoleon to be\r\nreplaced on the column of the Grande Armée in Paris.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WASHINGTON IRVING AND HIS FRIENDS\r\n    Painted by Daniel Huntington\r\n\r\n   1 Henry T Tackerman\r\n   2 Oliver Wendell Holmes\r\n   3 William Gilmore Simms\r\n   4 Fitz Greene Halleck\r\n   5 Nathaniel Hawthorne\r\n   6 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\r\n   7 Nathaniel Parker Willis\r\n   8 William H Prescott\r\n   9 Washington Irving\r\n  10 James K Paulding\r\n  11 Ralph Waldo Emerson\r\n  12 William Cullen Bryant\r\n  13 John P Kennedy\r\n  14 J Fenimore Cooper\r\n  15 George Bancroft]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prince Consort Albert]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First attempt to assassinate Victoria]\r\n\r\nIn England, great popular rejoicings had been occasioned by the marriage of\r\nQueen Victoria to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg. A bill was passed\r\nappointing the Prince Consort regent of England in case of the Queen's\r\ndeath. The royal couple were well matched. The credit of having brought\r\nabout this marriage was chiefly due to Lord Melbourne. The tactful conduct\r\nof Prince Albert after the marriage fully justified his choice. Yet Prince\r\nAlbert was never popular in England. Parliament cut down his proposed\r\nincome from the Crown by nearly one half. The lower classes were prejudiced\r\nagainst him as a foreigner, while the nobility and army turned against him\r\nwhen they found that he preferred the society of men eminent for their\r\nintellectual attainments to that of dukes and marquises. On June 10, an\r\ninsane pot-boy named Oxford attempted to assassinate the Queen and the\r\nPrince Consort with a pistol. The would-be assassin was confined in an\r\nasylum. On November 21, Queen Victoria gave birth to her eldest child,\r\nAugusta, who subsequently became Empress of Germany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Charter petition]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jack Frost's revolt]\r\n\r\nOther English events of domestic importance were the passage of the\r\nvaccination act, the introduction of screw propellers in the British navy,\r\nand the State trial of the three leaders of the Chartist movement of the\r\nprevious year. A monster petition subscribed by 1,280,000 signatures on a\r\ngreat cylinder was rolled into Parliament. In it were embodied new demands\r\nfor a bill of rights, or the \"People's Charter,\" comprising universal\r\nsuffrage, including that of woman, secret ballots, payment of Parliamentary\r\nrepresentatives, and the like. The denial of this petition provoked a\r\npopular uprising under the leadership of Jack Frost at Newport, which had\r\nto be suppressed by the military. After a sensational trial, the leaders\r\nwere condemned to deportation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Beau Brummel]\r\n\r\nEchoes of the English Regency were re-awakened by the death of \"Beau\"\r\nBrummel, a dandy after the manner of the French exquisites. It was a boast\r\nof this leader of fashion that he spoiled twenty-five cravats before one\r\nwas tied to his liking. The Prince Regent in his dress imitated Brummel.\r\nThe offended beau retaliated one day, when some of his friends saluted the\r\nPrince on Rotten Row, by asking, \"Who is your fat friend?\" Leigh Hunt\r\nimproved upon this in his \"Examiner\" by describing the Prince as \"a\r\ncorpulent Adonis of fifty.\" For this Hunt was sentenced to imprisonment for\r\ntwo years and fined £500. After George IV. became king, Brummel fell into\r\ndisfavor and had to leave London. Years later, the bankrupt beau, who had\r\nbeen cheated out of a snuff-box by Prince George, presented the King with\r\nanother in token of submission. In the words of Thackeray, \"the King took\r\nthe snuff, and ordered his horses, and drove on, and had not the grace to\r\nnotice his old companion--favorite, rival, enemy, superior.\" Poor Beau\r\nBrummel died in extreme poverty. Some of the striking episodes of the\r\nbeau's career were dramatized in a play, which has kept alive the memory of\r\nthis lesser light of modern English society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Paganini]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foremost violin virtuoso]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Genius and charlatan]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paganini's compositions]\r\n\r\nThe career of another striking figure of the Nineteenth Century was ended\r\nby the death of Paganini, the most remarkable of violin virtuosi. The son\r\nof a poor shopkeeper, with little musical knowledge, but of some\r\nproficiency on the mandolin, Paganini received an indifferent early\r\nschooling in music. After the boy had come under the tutelage of Costa, the\r\norchestral leader of Genoa, his progress on the violin was rapid. At the\r\nage of eight he composed a violin sonata. Soon he surpassed his\r\ninstructors. At sixteen he ran away from his father, after a concert at\r\nLucca, and made a tour of his own through Italy. Already he was addicted to\r\ngambling and other forms of dissipation. At Leghorn he had to sell his\r\nviolin to pay a gambling debt. A Frenchman, M. Levron, lent him his own\r\nGuarnero violin. When he heard him play on it he was so charmed that he\r\nmade him a present of the instrument. Paganini kept the Guarnero throughout\r\nthe rest of his life. It was the turning-point of his career. After two\r\nyears of incessant practice, Paganini appeared in public again at Lucca,\r\nwhere he aroused unbounded enthusiasm by his novel performances on the G\r\nstring. For the next twenty years he travelled and played throughout Italy,\r\nvanquishing all rivals. His superstitious countrymen believed him to be in\r\nleague with the Evil One, an impression which Paganini loved to confirm by\r\ndark utterances and eccentricities of dress. Not until 1828 did he leave\r\nhis own country to gather foreign laurels. His first appearance at Vienna\r\nwas an unprecedented triumph. The Emperor appointed him court violinist and\r\nthe city of Vienna presented him with a gold medal. From there he made a\r\ntriumphal tour through Europe, appearing in Berlin, Paris and London. He\r\nwas acknowledged the most wonderful violinist that had ever been heard. He\r\nsoon amassed a colossal fortune. Withal, Paganini was almost as much a\r\ncharlatan as he was an original genius. He liked to impress his audiences\r\nby fantastic eccentricities and by mere tricks of legerdemain, such as\r\ndropping and catching his instrument, or breaking one string after another\r\nto finish his concert on one alone. Other tricks of virtuosity, such as\r\ntuning up the A string by a semi-tone, left hand pizzicato, or his double\r\nthirds, were executed with such stupendous technique that they held\r\nconnoisseurs and amateurs spellbound. His individuality, in fact, was so\r\nabnormal that it rendered him unfit to play with others in quartets or\r\nother chamber music. As a man he had all the worst faults of a genius. The\r\nvast sums of money which he accumulated were gambled away. His whole life\r\nwas disgraced by unbridled sensuality coupled with sordid avarice. This\r\nexplains in a measure Paganini's inferior rank as a composer. Famous are\r\nhis variations on the tune \"God Save the King,\" his \"Studies,\" his twenty\r\nvariations on \"Il Carnevale di Venezia,\" and the concert allegro \"Perpetual\r\nMotion.\" The celebrated twenty-four violin capricci, written early in\r\nPaganini's career, have been rendered familiar by their transcriptions to\r\nthe pianoforte by Schumann and Liszt. Paganini died from the results of\r\ndissipation. He left his famous Guarnero fiddle to his birthplace, Genoa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frederick William IV. King of Prussia]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, King Frederick William III. of Prussia died in his sixty-sixth\r\nyear. He was succeeded by Frederick William IV. The pending dispute between\r\nthe Prussian Government and the Vatican, arising out of the refusal of the\r\nRhenish priests to sanction marriages between Catholics and Protestants,\r\nfound a temporary adjustment by the new king's concessions to the clergy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious discussions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese naval brigade]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Chusan]\r\n\r\nIn England, too, church questions temporarily rose uppermost during debates\r\nin Parliament over the proposed government assistance to schools in which\r\nthe Douay Bible, or Roman Catholic version of the Scriptures, was used. On\r\naccount of these Parliamentary debates, and the attempted reform of Irish\r\nregistration by which more Roman Catholic voters were to be admitted, a\r\nloud anti-Popery cry was raised by the English Tories. Once more the House\r\nof Peers rejected a bill for removing the political disabilities of the\r\nJews, after its passage through the Commons by a handsome majority of 113\r\nyeas. The attention of Englishmen at this time was diverted to questions of\r\nforeign policy. The British expedition against China had arrived at the\r\nmouth of the Canton River in June. A naval blockade was established in\r\nChinese waters. The Chinese retaliated by offering a reward for every\r\nEnglishman taken, and a prize of $20,000 for the destruction of a British\r\nman-of-war. Sir Gordon Bremer sent an expedition against the Island of\r\nChusan. The Chinese officials refused to surrender until after the city of\r\nTinghai had been all but demolished by the English guns. Tinghai was made a\r\nBritish base of supplies, but proved a very unhealthy place. The Chinese\r\ncapture of an English subject, Vincent Stanton, was followed by a British\r\nexpedition into the Canton River. The barrier forts, after a heavy\r\nbombardment, were taken by storm. Stanton was released. The British fleet\r\nmade demonstrations at Amay, Ningpo, and in the Gulf of Pechili. Emperor\r\nTaouk-Wang sent for troops from the interior. Mandarin Lin, who had entered\r\ninto negotiations with the British, was degraded and was succeeded by\r\nViceroy Keshen of Peiho. Keshen received Lord Palmerston's formal demands\r\nupon China and forwarded them to Pekin. By dilatory tactics he succeeded in\r\ngaining a breathing space.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Burmese expedition]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sikhs restive]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Kelat]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Todd leaves Herat]\r\n\r\nIn India, the British occupation of Kabul continued. New trouble broke out\r\nin Burma where the British Resident was expelled from Ava. An expedition\r\nhad to be sent against Burma. The death of Runjit Singh led to a series of\r\nrevolutions which shook the Sikh dominion to its foundations. The\r\nsuccessive deaths of Runjit Singh's son and grandson, who had succeeded him\r\nas Maharajas, led to a general belief that they had been murdered by the\r\nPrime Minister, Dhian Singh. All the chief Sirdars rose against Dhian. The\r\nSikh army of Khalsak, numbering 7,000 soldiers, became a menace for\r\nHindustan. In July, the British garrison of Kelat in Beluchistan was\r\noverpowered by the natives. Lord Auckland had to prepare another expedition\r\nto restore English prestige in that quarter. Kelat was retaken by the\r\nBritish in November. New complications arose at Herat. This had long been\r\nthe bone of contention between Great Britain and Russia in Central Asia.\r\nBritish ascendency over Herat had been gained by large financial subsidies,\r\nwhich had been spent in frustrating the designs of the Persians and\r\nRussians in that quarter. Major d'Arcy Todd, the English envoy at Herat,\r\nincensed by King Kamram's continued dealings with Russia, withheld the\r\nfurther payment of the British subsidies, unless British troops were\r\nadmitted to Herat. The situation became so acute that Major Todd on his own\r\nauthority threw up his post and left Herat. It was a severe setback for\r\nBritish influence in Central Asia. Lord Auckland in exasperation dismissed\r\nhis erstwhile ambassador from political employ. Todd found a soldier's\r\ndeath on the field of Ferozeshahar. The continued rebellion of the\r\nSarawacks in Borneo gave the British an opportunity for interference there.\r\nSir James Brooke, at the head of a British expedition, helped the Sultan of\r\nBorneo in quelling the rising.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish-Egyptian War]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mehemet Ali brought to terms]\r\n\r\nThe operations of the international coalition against Mehemet Ali of Egypt\r\nhad now begun. Though the Viceroy's soldiers lay on Turkish soil without a\r\nfoe before them, and France stood at his back, Mehemet Ali found himself\r\ncheckmated. While Russia undertook to keep Ibrahim's army out of\r\nConstantinople, all French support was neutralized by Germany's\r\nmobilization on the Rhine. A naval squadron, composed of British and\r\nAustrian warships, was free to land the Turkish forces in Syria. On October\r\n10, Commodore Napier bombarded Beyrout. The Syrians were armed against\r\ntheir Egyptian oppressors. On November 3, the British and Austrian fleets\r\ncaptured Acre. Ibrahim, with the remains of his army, fell back toward the\r\nEgyptian frontier. When the British fleet arrived before Alexandria,\r\nMehemet Ali made haste to come to terms. In contravention of the ultimatum\r\nof the Powers, he was allowed to retain his hereditary dominion over Egypt\r\nupon relinquishment of Syria, and of the Turkish fleet, which had been\r\nbetrayed into his hands. Sir Charles Napier in later years, while speaking\r\nof his part in this expedition in Parliament, said: \"I was ashamed for my\r\ncountry and for myself.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Thiers' Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oriental affairs readjusted]\r\n\r\nThe humiliating position forced upon France caused the downfall of the\r\nMinistry of Thiers. Marshal Soult was placed at the head of affairs. Guizot\r\nwas recalled from his embassy at London to take the portfolio of Foreign\r\nAffairs. He succeeded in restoring France to her former place in the\r\nconcert of Europe. The French Government joined with the other powers in\r\nthe restoration of the ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire by which all\r\nforeign warships were excluded from the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles.\r\nRussia thereby virtually conceded the abrogation of her treaty of Unkiar\r\nSkelessi. On the other hand, Sebastopol and the Russian arsenals of the\r\nEuxine were thus safeguarded against any maritime attack except by Turkey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleon's body returned]\r\n\r\nThe revival of the Napoleonic legend by such writers as Béranger,\r\nLamartine, and Victor Hugo, together with other influences which served to\r\nkeep bright the glories of the Empire, bore their fruit in the return of\r\nNapoleon's remains to France. On October 15, his body had been removed from\r\nthe simple tomb at St. Helena. On November 30, the ship bearing Napoleon's\r\nremains arrived at Cherbourg. A million francs were voted by the Chambers\r\nfor the new sepulchre under the dome of the chapel of the Hôtel des\r\nInvalides. On this occasion great publicity was given to Lord Palmerston's\r\nletter to Ambassador Granville: \"The government of her British Majesty hope\r\nthat the promptness of their response to this French request will be\r\nconsidered in France as a proof of their desire to efface all traces of\r\nthose national animosities which, during the life of the Emperor armed\r\nagainst each other the French and English nations. The government of her\r\nMajesty are confident that if such sentiments still exist anywhere, they\r\nwill be buried in the tomb in which the remains of Napoleon are to be\r\nlaid.\" Napoleon's reburial was witnessed by a million of persons including\r\na hundred and fifty thousand soldiers drawn up in line to do him honor. The\r\nceremonies were attended by the royal family and all the dignitaries of\r\nFrance, excepting only the immediate relatives of the great Napoleon. As it\r\nhappened, those of the Napoleonides that were not dead were either in exile\r\nor in prison.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Floods in France]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earthquake of Zante]\r\n\r\nShortly before this, great havoc had been wrought in France by disastrous\r\ninundations of the Saone and Rhone. The water, which covered 60,000 acres,\r\nand flooded Lyons, rose higher than it had within 250 years. In Greece, a\r\ntremendous earthquake laid the city of Zante in ruins. These catastrophes\r\nwere made the object of special study in Germany and Switzerland, where\r\nAgassiz was in the midst of his epoch-making discourses on the glacial\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Isabella abdicates]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rule of Espartero]\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year wretched Spain suffered another political\r\nupheaval. After the last abandonment of the cause of Don Carlos by General\r\nCabrera, in July, the Queen-Regent found herself confronted by a strong\r\ndemocratic party both in the Cortes and the country. The scandals of her\r\nprivate life undermined her political authority. By an insurrection at\r\nBarcelona she was forced to call in General Espartero, the chief of the\r\nProgressist party, as her Prime Minister. Rather than submit to his demands\r\nshe abdicated the Regency in October and left Spain. Espartero, toward the\r\nclose of the year, was acknowledged by the Cortes as Regent of Spain. His\r\nfirst measures turned a large part of the people against him. On December\r\n29, as a result of the growing discussions between the government and the\r\nclergy, the Papal Nuncio was expelled from Madrid. Thereafter Espartero and\r\nthe clerical party of Spain were at daggers' points.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Overbeck]\r\n\r\nThis year Friedrich Overbeck finished his masterpiece, the \"Triumph of\r\nReligion and the Arts.\" This German artist, at the time when the classicism\r\nof David was at its height, had become his most strenuous opponent, and had\r\nbrought about the regeneration of the German religious school of painting.\r\nHe and several of his followers formed the Nazarites, whose fundamental\r\nprinciple was that art existed only for the service of religion. Overbeck's\r\nfrescoes of the \"History of Joseph\" and \"Jerusalem Delivered\" are best\r\nknown. Among his paintings of this period, \"The Entrance of Christ into\r\nJerusalem\" at Luebeck, \"Christ on the Mount of Olives\" at Hamburg, and \"The\r\nCoronation of Mary\" in the Cathedral of Cologne, are the most celebrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1841\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British capture Bogue forts]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hong Kong ceded to Britain]\r\n\r\nThe dilatory tactics of Viceroy Keshen in China had prolonged the\r\nnegotiations there for several weeks. In the meanwhile a large Chinese army\r\nwas gathering in the interior. Early in the year, after the arrival of the\r\nBritish plenipotentiaries, orders were issued for an attack on the Bogue\r\nforts. On January 7, 1,500 British troops were landed on the flank and rear\r\nof the forts at Chuenpee. After a sharp cannonade by the fleets, the forts\r\nwere carried by a storming party under Captain Herbert. Simultaneously the\r\nforts at Taikok were destroyed by the fleet, and their Chinese garrison was\r\nrouted by landing parties. Several Chinese junks were sunk during the\r\nengagement. In all the Chinese lost some 1,500 men in casualties; the\r\nBritish losses were small. After the capture of the Bogue forts, Viceroy\r\nKeshen came to terms. He agreed to pay a large money indemnity and to cede\r\nHong Kong absolutely. On January 29, Hong Kong was declared a British\r\npossession, and was heavily garrisoned with the troops transferred from\r\nChusan. The importance of the new acquisition was scarcely realized by\r\nEnglishmen at the time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese convention repudiated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British threaten Canton]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English opium factory destroyed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canton bombarded]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heavy ransom exacted]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British camp attacked]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More ransom saves Canton]\r\n\r\nThe suspension of hostilities proved but temporary. Keshen was degraded and\r\nbanished. Emperor Taouk-Wang issued an edict that he was resolved \"to\r\ndestroy and wash the foreigners away, without remorse.\" Keshen's successor,\r\nElang, repudiated the convention signed by his predecessor. On February 25,\r\nthe British proceeded to attack the inner line of forts guarding the\r\napproaches to Canton. The formidable lines of Anunghoy, with batteries of\r\ntwo hundred guns, were carried in the first rush. In quick succession the\r\nother positions of the Chinese were taken, until, on March 1, the English\r\nsquadron drew up in Whampoa Reach, under the very walls of Canton. On the\r\narrival of Sir Hugh Gough, to take command of the British forces, a brief\r\narmistice was granted. After a few days, hostilities were renewed by the\r\ncapture of the outer line of defences. Under the threat of immediate\r\nmilitary occupation, the Viceroy of Canton came to terms. On March 18, the\r\nBritish reoccupied their opium factories in Canton. Emperor Taouk-Wang's\r\nanti-foreign policy remained unshaken. He appointed a new commission of\r\nthree mandarins to govern Canton, and collected an army of 50,000 men in\r\nthat province. In May, Captain Elliot was insulted in the streets of\r\nCanton. He sent for reinforcements from Sir Hugh Gough at Hong Kong. A\r\nnotice was issued advising all Englishmen to leave Canton that day. On the\r\nfollowing night the Chinese sacked the opium warehouses and fired upon the\r\nBritish ships lying at anchor. Fire rafts were let loose against the\r\nsquadron, but drifted astray. The British promptly took the offensive. They\r\nsunk forty war junks, and dismantled the Chinese batteries. On May 24, Sir\r\nHugh Gough arrived at Canton with all his forces. The fleet advanced up the\r\nMacao passage, and troops were landed under unusually difficult\r\ncircumstances. The Chinese failed to take advantage of this, preferring to\r\nawait the British attack in a strong line of intrenchments north of the\r\ncity. On May 25, two British columns of 2,000 men each, with sixteen pieces\r\nof artillery and fifty-two rockets, advanced to the attack across the\r\nsacred burial grounds. Three of the hill forts were carried with slight\r\nloss. At the fourth fort desperate resistance was encountered. After this\r\nfort had succumbed to a bayonet attack the Chinese rallied in an open camp\r\none mile to the rear. Intrenchments were thrown up with remarkable\r\nrapidity. The British troops, led by the Royal Irish Fusiliers, streamed\r\nover the open ground and scattered the remaining forces of the Chinese. The\r\nbrilliancy of this exploit was dimmed by the slaughter of Chinamen while\r\nasking quarter. The British losses were 70 killed and wounded. A general\r\nattack on the city was ordered for the next day. A fierce hurricane and\r\ndeluge of rain frustrated this plan. During the day the Canton mandarins\r\ncame to terms. They agreed to pay an indemnity of $6,000,000, and to\r\nwithdraw their troops sixty miles from the city. A few days after this,\r\nwhen $5,000,000 of the indemnity had already been paid, the Chinese broke\r\nthe armistice by an attempt to surprise the British camp. Instead of\r\ndriving the attack home, the Chinese soldiers, some 10,000 in number,\r\ncontented themselves with waving their banners and uttering yells of\r\ndefiance. The British artillery opened on them, and a running fight ensued.\r\nIn the midst of it a violent thunderstorm burst over Canton. A detachment\r\nof Madras Sepoys lost its way, and was all but overwhelmed by the Chinese.\r\nThey had to be extricated by a rescue party of marines, armed with the new\r\npercussion gun, which was proof against wet weather. Under threat of\r\nimmediate bombardment, the payment of more ransom was exacted from Canton.\r\nIn the end the city was spared, to remain, according to the English\r\nformula, \"a record of British magnanimity and forbearance.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reduction of Amoy]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese reverses]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Indian diversion]\r\n\r\nAfter this the opium trade reverted to its former footing. To bring the\r\nChinese Emperor, himself, to terms, Sir Henry Pottinger, the new British\r\nplenipotentiary, sailed northward, and appeared before the seaport of Amoy,\r\nnominally at peace with England. The Viceroy of Amoy sent a flag of truce\r\nto demand what was wanted. He was called upon to surrender the town. This\r\nhe refused to do. The British ships at once engaged the land batteries, and\r\nlanding parties were sent around the rear. The Chinese gunners were driven\r\nfrom their pieces, but several of their officers committed suicide. The\r\ncommandant of the chief fort drowned himself in the face of both armies.\r\nThe capture of Amoy remained barren of useful results. The British fleet\r\nproceeded northward until scattered by a hurricane in the Channel of\r\nFormosa. Coming together off Ningpo, the fleet attacked Chusan for the\r\nsecond time. Spirited resistance was offered by the Chinese. In the\r\ndefence of the capital city Tinghai, Keo, the Chinese general-in-chief, was\r\nkilled. All his officers fell with him. Leaving a garrison at Chusan, the\r\nBritish attacked Chinhai on the mainland. Here the Chinese suffered their\r\nheaviest losses. After this victory the city of Ningpo was occupied without\r\nopposition. The inhabitants shut themselves up and wrote on their doors:\r\n\"Submissive people.\" Nevertheless, Ningpo was put to ransom, under threats\r\nof immediate pillage. More British troops and warships were arriving to\r\ncarry the war to the bitter end, when news arrived of disastrous events in\r\nAfghanistan. Troops had to be diverted in that direction, and a more\r\ndefinite settlement of the Chinese question was accordingly postponed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corn Law agitation]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richard Cobden]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of Melbourne's Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliamentary precedents defied]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adverse elections]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peel, Prime Minister]\r\n\r\nThe attention of Englishmen at home was all but engrossed by domestic\r\ntopics. In Parliament, the opposition found its strongest issue in the long\r\ndemanded reform of the Corn Laws. Various circumstances, such as increase\r\nof population and bad harvests, contributed to bring this issue to the\r\nfront. The retaliatory tariffs adopted by America, Russia, France, Sweden\r\nand the German Zollverein had their serious effect on British trade. The\r\nresulting financial depression engendered discontent. It was at this time\r\nthat Richard Cobden came into prominence with his free trade views. Then\r\nbegan the great struggle over the Corn Laws which, until its settlement,\r\nremained the most important question of the day in England. Lord\r\nMelbourne's Ministry by its attempt to adjust the sugar bounties, and\r\nincidentally the Corn Laws, dealt the first formidable blow against the\r\ngreat system of monopoly called protection. The government's proposals on\r\nthat subject were denounced as an encouragement of the produce of the\r\nsugars of Cuba and other slave states at the expense of the British West\r\nIndies, where slavery had been abolished. As a result the anti-slavery\r\nWhigs joined with the Tories, under the leadership of Peel. The government\r\nwas defeated by a majority of thirty-six votes. In contravention of\r\nParliamentary customs, Lord Melbourne's Ministry did not hand in their\r\nresignations, neither did they see fit to dissolve Parliament. When\r\nParliament met again Sir Robert Peel, amid tumultuous cheering from his\r\nfollowers, moved a direct vote of want of confidence in the government. By\r\na majority of one the motion was carried. The dissolution of Parliament was\r\nannounced on the morrow. The appeal to the country resulted in a strong\r\ngain of Conservatives. The moribund Ministry made another attempt to carry\r\ntheir measures before retiring from office. Sir Robert Peel, in his\r\nproposals for a sliding scale in the duties on corn, already showed some\r\nbias toward that free-trade policy to which he afterward became committed.\r\nOn the first division on this question the government was outvoted by a\r\nmajority of sixty-four. Melbourne's resignation was of course followed by\r\nthe elevation of Peel to the Prime Ministry. Lord Palmerston was replaced\r\nby the Earl of Aberdeen in the Foreign Office. Lord Lyndhurst was retained\r\nin the Chancellorship. The leadership of the Upper House was left to the\r\nDuke of Wellington, who joined the Cabinet without taking any office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of mission work]\r\n\r\nThroughout the year industrial distress prevailed in England and Ireland,\r\nwith the usual consequence of an increase in crime. The vigorous support of\r\nBritish trade in the Far East was followed by an extension of Christian\r\nmissions. Thus missionary work was resumed in China, while Livingstone\r\npreached the Gospel to the Hottentots of South Africa. The growth in\r\ncolonial bishoprics caused Sidney Smith to say that soon there would not be\r\na rock in the ocean without an English bishop and archdeacon. During this\r\nyear adhesive postage stamps were first used in England. Wheatstone\r\npatented his alphabetic printing telegraph, and telegraph wires were strung\r\nas far as Glasgow. Almost simultaneously with the death of Hook, the\r\nBritish humorist, the new publication of \"Punch, or the London Charivari,\"\r\nmade its appearance. One of its earliest contributors was George\r\nCruikshank, the caricaturist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William H. Harrison inaugurated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Harrison]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tyler, tenth President]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canadian boundary treaty]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American financial policy]\r\n\r\nIn British North America, the first Parliament of Canada was opened with\r\ngreat ceremony in June. After the changes in the Ministry, Sir Charles\r\nBagett became Governor-General of Canada. In the United States, General\r\nHarrison was inaugurated as President. It rained on his inauguration day,\r\nand the aged General suffered so from exposure that he contracted\r\npneumonia. One month later he died. The clamor of office-seekers during his\r\nbrief tenure contributed largely to his death. Harrison had been active in\r\npublic life since he was Secretary of the Northwest Territory in 1797. He\r\nacquired a national reputation by his victory over the Indians at\r\nTippecanoe. He served as Senator from Indiana from 1825 to 1828, when he\r\nbecame Minister to the Republic of Colombia in South America. Congress,\r\nafter some debate, passed a bill to appropriate one year's Presidential\r\nsalary to General Harrison's widow. Vice-President Tyler became President.\r\nA Virginian by birth, he was committed to the Southern theory of State\r\nrights. In his first message he recognized the veto of the United States\r\nBank measure as approved by the nation. This caused a decisive break with\r\nthe holdover Cabinet. All the members resigned except Daniel Webster, who\r\nwas retained to complete the Canadian boundary treaty with England. The\r\nline at length agreed upon gave to the United States 7,000 square miles,\r\nand to Great Britain 5,000, with the navigation of the St. John's River.\r\nLord Ashburton in a speech at New York declared that never again could war\r\nbe possible between the two countries. Tyler's new Secretary of State was\r\nUpham. The first measure of the Whigs was the repeal of the independent\r\nTreasury act of the previous Congress, and the next was the establishment\r\nof a general system of bankruptcy, and for distribution of the public land\r\nrevenue. The former was more than a bankrupt law; it was practically an\r\ninsolvent law for the abolition of debts at the will of the debtor. The\r\nbill passed both Houses. The land-revenue distribution was made imperative\r\nby the fact that various American States and municipalities owed\r\n$200,000,000 to European creditors. These became uneasy, and wished the\r\nFederal Government to assume their debts. The system was first favored in\r\n1838, and again in 1839, and in 1840 became a national issue. Although\r\nCalhoun and Benton both opposed the measure as a squandering of the public\r\npatrimony, it passed by a party vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tyler's vetoes]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loss of Whig support]\r\n\r\nA compromise tariff measure, advocated by Clay, provided for an upward\r\nscale of duties, to reach their maximum during the following year. The bill\r\nwas vetoed by the President. Another important measure was that for the\r\nrechartering of the National Bank. It passed both Houses by a close vote,\r\nbut Tyler vetoed it, to the consternation of the Whigs. On the second vote\r\nthe necessary two-thirds majority was not obtained. Thus the second attempt\r\nto resuscitate the old United States Bank resulted in failure. After this\r\nthe Whigs withdrew their support from the Administration they had put into\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nDuring this year, in America, the grain drill was patented. Wilkes explored\r\nthe coast of California. Graham's Magazine was published--one of the first\r\nAmerican literary magazines of high pretensions. Among its earliest\r\ncontributors was Edgar Allan Poe. At the same time Longfellow published his\r\nballads, Cooper his \"Deerslayer,\" and Ralph Waldo Emerson brought out his\r\nphilosophical lectures in essay form.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Close of Seminole War]\r\n\r\nWar with the Seminoles continued unabated. In the spring, General William\r\nJ. Worth had been appointed to succeed Armisted. During the summer, Worth\r\ndispersed his troops into small parties, which ascended the rivers and\r\npenetrated the swamps to the islands to which the Indians had retired.\r\nWorth brought Chief Coacoochee to Tampa in irons. To secure peace, Worth\r\nbade him name five of his fellow chieftains, who were to return to the\r\nIndians and inform them that unless they should appear at Tampa within a\r\ngiven time and give themselves up, Coacoochee and his fellow prisoners\r\nwould forthwith be hanged. The Indians came within the appointed time. As\r\none band after another surrendered they were sent West to Mississippi. The\r\ncost of the war from first to last had been $40,000,000, which was twice\r\nthe sum paid for the Territories of Louisiana and Florida together. It was\r\nestimated that for each black slave brought back from Florida to his\r\nowners, three white men had lost their lives, and $80,000 had been\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Latin-American upheavals]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, the Presidency of Bustamente was superseded by that of General\r\nSanta Anna. The northern States of Mexico maintained their independent\r\nattitude. The State of Costa Rica attempted to withdraw from the ascendant\r\ninfluence of Guatemala. About the same time the city of Cartago was\r\ndestroyed by an earthquake. In Colombia, Marquez maintained himself as\r\nPresident against his opponents. The States of Panama and Veragua seceded\r\nfrom the Colombian Union, but the President prevailed upon them to return\r\nto the confederation. In South America, an expedition from Peru invaded\r\nBolivia and laid siege to La Paz, only to be driven back. Peru was now\r\ninvaded by an army from Bolivia, but General Bolnes, the newly elected\r\nPresident of Chile, interfered on behalf of Peru.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolts in Spain]\r\n\r\nIn Spain, General Espartero throughout this year continued his precarious\r\nrule. In October, Generals O'Donnel and Concha headed a rising at Pambulna\r\nin behalf of the former Queen-Regent Christina. The Queen's guard repelled\r\nan attack of Don Diego Leon on the palace. On October 15, Don Diego was\r\ncaptured and shot. One week later O'Donnel fled to France. On the same day,\r\nGeneral Zurbano gained possession of the citadel and port of Bilbao. He\r\ndeclared himself in favor of the Queen-Regent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Algerian victories]\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Pyrenees the restoration of the French _entente\r\ncordiale_ with England and the other European Powers was manifested in the\r\nconclusion of the International Convention of Alexandria in July, and the\r\nquintuple treaty for suppression of the slave trade proposed by the British\r\nGovernment. The French cry for the forcible recovery of the Rhine frontier\r\ndied down and public funds rose accordingly. Alfred de Musset's second\r\ninvective poem on \"Le Rhin Allemand\" scarcely raised a stir. All desire for\r\nmilitary conquests was satisfied for the moment by the exploits of French\r\narms under General Bugeaud and the Duc d'Aumale in Algeria. For once the\r\nArab chiefs of the Desert were cowed into submission. The effect of the Duc\r\nd'Aumale's triumphal return was spoiled somewhat by the attempt to\r\nassassinate him on September 13. Under Guizot's guidance the French\r\nChambers showed their appreciation of the flourishing state of literature\r\nin France by their amendments to the copyright law, extending the\r\nprovisions of copyright to a period of thirty years after an author's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Lermontov]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lermontov's work]\r\n\r\nMichel Jurgevitch Lermontov, the Russian poet, died on July 27, as the\r\nresult of a duel in the Caucasus. His romance, \"A Hero of Our Time,\" was\r\nthe immediate cause of the duel. This poet was the Russian spokesman of the\r\nso-called Weltschmerz (world-sorrow) which had come into vogue with the\r\n\"Sorrows of Werther.\" Following in the wake of Chateaubriand and Byron,\r\nLermontov wrote epic poems in a pessimistic, cynical strain, without\r\nattaining quite the bitterness of spirit of a Byron or Heine, nor the\r\nmelancholy lyric beauty of a Lenau or Leopardi. Pre-eminent, on the other\r\nhand, are his poetical descriptions of the scenery and wild national traits\r\nof the Caucasus, which furnished the background for almost all of his\r\npoems. Noteworthy among his epics are \"The Circassian Boy,\" \"Ismail Bey,\"\r\n\"Valerik,\" \"Hadshy-Abrak,\" and \"The Demon.\" Under Czar Nicholas,\r\nLermontov's works were forbidden in Russia. After having been banished to\r\nthe Caucasus, for demanding revenge for Pushkin's death, the poet published\r\nhis last brilliant epic, \"Song of Czar Ivan Vasilyevitch,\" under a\r\npseudonym.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German letters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussian General Estates]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, too, letters and arts were flourishing. In Vienna, Nikolaus\r\nLenau (Baron Strehlenau) and his friend, Anastasius Gruen (Count\r\nAuersperg), were the leaders of a literary movement which found its\r\ncounterpart in the so-called \"Young German\" movement of the north, where\r\nFerdinand Freiligrath, Laube, Gutzkow, and Emanuel Geibel came under the\r\nban of the German Bundesrath. The great political event of the year was the\r\nmeeting of the first General Estates, convoked at Berlin. The new king's\r\nhostile attitude toward their popular demands for constitutional rights and\r\nlarger liberties soon destroyed the hopes of liberal Germans for a change\r\nof spirit in the government of Prussia. A more material advance in\r\ncivilization was assured by the opening of the first railway from Berlin to\r\nMagdeburg.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cornelius]\r\n\r\nPeter von Cornelius, one of the leaders of the religious Catholic movement\r\nin art which had followed the classicism of the first decade of the\r\ncentury, was commissioned by the King to decorate the cemetery at Berlin.\r\nThese decorations afterward, as well as the mural paintings in the Church\r\nof Saint Louis at Munich, proved to be his masterpieces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defence of Jellalabad]\r\n\r\nThe British occupation of Afghanistan had continued since the last year.\r\nThe expenses of the occupation were so heavy that economy was imperative.\r\nAs soon as the British Resident cut down the subsidies paid to Shah Shuja\r\nthe situation took a sinister turn. In October, Sir Robert Sale left Kabul\r\nwith a brigade of British troops to reopen communications with Jellalabad,\r\nwhich had been interrupted by hostile mountain tribes. He got to Jellalabad\r\nonly after a desperate struggle and heavy losses. His subsequent defence of\r\nthat stronghold against the Afghans is one of the heroic traditions of\r\nBritish India.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Kabul]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Afghans up in arms]\r\n\r\nAt Kabul, in the meanwhile, the garrison had been removed from the citadel\r\nof Bala Hasir to open cantonments outside of the city. Sir William\r\nMacNaghten, the British Resident, had been appointed Governor of Bombay,\r\nand was about to be succeeded by Sir Alexander Byrnes. Byrnes took up his\r\nabode in the centre of the city amid the turbulent bazaars. On November 2,\r\nthe people of Kabul rose against the English. Byrnes barricaded his house\r\nand sent to MacNaghten for help. On the advice of General Elphinstone,\r\nMacNaghten decided to wait for further information before acting. The delay\r\nwas fatal for Byrnes. He held out with thirty-two others from eight in the\r\nmorning until two in the afternoon. Then the ammunition gave out. The mob\r\nrushed in and tore the house to pieces. Byrnes and twenty-three of his\r\nfollowers were massacred. One hour later a British relief corps tried to\r\nenter the city. All Kabul turned against them. The British were forced to\r\nretire. The news of this set Afghanistan wild. Thousands of armed\r\nmountaineers flocked to Kabul, and the whole nation rose against the\r\nforeigners. The British troops were cut off from all supplies. They\r\nmaintained their precarious position only by lavish promises of ransom. At\r\nlength, after many parleys, a meeting was arranged, for December 23,\r\nbetween MacNaghten and the Afghan chiefs. When the English envoy walked\r\ninto the meeting the Afghans fell upon him, and he was slain by Akbar\r\nKhan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1842\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MacNaghten's murder unavenged]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The retreat from Kabul]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disaster of Khaibar Pass]\r\n\r\nThe situation of the British in Afghanistan was so critical that they could\r\nnot avenge the murder of their countrymen. Negotiations were actually\r\nrenewed with Akbar Khan upon his statement that he had not meant to murder\r\nthe British envoy, but had been goaded into the act by the taunts of\r\nMacNaghten. Promises of safe conduct were obtained. In January the British\r\nforces began their retreat from Kabul. Then followed a series of\r\ntreacheries and mutual breaches of faith. Akbar Khan and his hordes of\r\nAfghans dogged the retreating column exacting further concessions. The\r\nEnglish women and children were demanded as hostages. From the heights of\r\nthe Khaibar Pass, the Ghilzai mountaineers poured a destructive fire into\r\nthe Englishmen. Akbar Khan's followers made common cause with them.\r\nThousands of Englishmen were slain, or perished in the deep snows of the\r\nKhaibar Pass. The wounded and those who fell behind were butchered by the\r\nAfghans. A fortnight sufficed to cut the whole column to pieces. Of the\r\nentire force of 4,000 soldiers and 12,000 followers, one single survivor\r\nsucceeded in reaching Jellalabad. He was a British surgeon named Brydon,\r\nwho dragged himself on all fours out of reach of the Afghans; but he lived\r\nto tell the tale for more than thirty years afterward.\r\n\r\nColonel Stoddart and Captain Connelly had been sent as British emissaries\r\nto Bokhara. When the news of the British massacre at Kabul reached Bokhara,\r\nboth men were promptly thrown into prison. Later, when the news of the\r\nBritish disaster in the Khaibar Pass reached Bokhara, the Ameer had the two\r\nenvoys taken from their dungeons. They were publicly beheaded in the\r\nmarket-place of Bokhara.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Ellenborough in India]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jellalabad relieved]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recapture of Kabul]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British vandalism]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs in India when Lord Ellenborough landed at\r\nCalcutta in February, to succeed Lord Auckland as Governor-General. The\r\nfirst trying need was to rescue the remaining British garrisons at\r\nJellalabad and Kandahar. General Pollock, with a strong force of Sepoys,\r\nwas sent through the Punjab and Peshawar. In April, he pushed his way\r\nthrough the Khaibar Pass, in the face of fierce resistance from the\r\nmountaineers. The relieving force reached Jellalabad none too soon. General\r\nSale and his garrison were fighting for time. In a last sortie they had\r\njust inflicted a telling defeat on Akbar Khan and his besieging army. From\r\nKabul the boy sovereign of the Afghans fled out of Akbar Khan's reach and\r\nput himself under the protection of General Pollock. Akbar Khan now wrote\r\nto General Pollock, offering to deliver up his British prisoners and\r\nhostages if he would withdraw from Afghanistan. Lord Ellenborough showed\r\nhimself inclined to accept this proposition. The British officers at the\r\nfront were furious. General Pollock wrote to Nott at Kandahar not to move\r\nuntil further instructions, while he himself reported to headquarters that\r\nhe could not retire to Jellalabad for want of transports. Eventually, Lord\r\nEllenborough consented to modify his instructions. Without waiting for\r\nthis, General Nott was already marching on Kabul. Pollock, accompanied by\r\nSale, left Jellalabad to support Nott's advance. In the Tezeen Valley the\r\nBritish came upon the scene of one of the bloodiest massacres of the\r\nretreat from Kabul. The sight of the murdered bodies of their comrades\r\nexasperated the soldiers. The heights around were bristling with Akbar\r\nKhan's men. In the face of a murderous fire from their matchlocks, the\r\nBritish stormed the heights and gave no quarter. Akbar Khan fled into the\r\nnorthern hills. In September, Nott's column took Kabul and hoisted the\r\nBritish flag over the Bala Hassar. The English captives managed to bribe\r\ntheir keepers and to join the rescuing army, amid general rejoicings. The\r\nBritish conquest of Afghanistan was followed by barbarous deeds of\r\nvandalism. The great bazaar of Kabul, one of the handsomest stone\r\nstructures of Central Asia, was blown up by gunpowder. The city itself was\r\nturned over to loot and massacre. The bloodcurdling atrocities of the white\r\nmen on that occasion kept alive the fierce hatred of all things British in\r\nAfghanistan for years to come. By the express orders of Lord Ellenborough\r\nthe sacred sandalwood gates of Somnath, which had adorned the tomb of\r\nMahmud of Ghasni since the Eleventh Century, were brought away as trophies\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boers driven from Natal]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foundation of Transvaal]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, too, the seeds of enduring hatred were sown at this time.\r\nScarcely had the new Boer community in Zululand become well settled when a\r\nproclamation was issued in Cape Town, declaring that Natal should become a\r\nBritish territory. Soldiers were despatched to Durban to support this\r\nclaim. After some sharp fighting the Boers were driven out of the seaport.\r\nWhen the British Commissioner arrived at Pietermaritzburg, a stormy mass\r\nmeeting was held. For two hours Erasmus Smith, the Boer predicant, argued\r\nin vain in behalf of his flock. In the end the Boer women passed a\r\nunanimous resolution that rather than submit to English rule they would\r\nemigrate once more. Pointing to the Drakensberg Mountains, the oldest of\r\nthe women said: \"We go across those mountains to freedom or to death.\" Over\r\nthese mountains almost the whole population of Natal trekked their way into\r\nthe uninhabited regions beyond. Only 300 families remained, the ancestors\r\nof some 10,000 Afrikanders of Natal in later days. On the other side of the\r\nOrange and Vaal Rivers the Boer emigrants founded once more their\r\ncommonwealth, known later as the Transvaal, or South African Republic.\r\n\r\nIn Australia the first representative constitution was granted to the\r\nEnglish colonists of New South Wales. Almost simultaneously with this began\r\nthe agitation for separating Victoria from New South Wales.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Sliding Scale\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British Income Tax]\r\n\r\nIn England, early in the Parliamentary session, Sir Robert Peel on behalf\r\nof the government moved his famous bill for a sliding scale of the duties\r\non corn. In the debate that followed, the most notable speeches were made\r\nby Cobden and Macaulay, who advocated complete free trade. In spite of all\r\nopposition, the bill in an unamended form reached its third reading and was\r\npassed on the 5th of April. The most serious difficulty confronting the\r\ngovernment was a financial deficit of £2,570,000, to which had to be added\r\nthe heavy expenditures for the wars in India and China. To fill up this\r\ndeficiency, Peel resorted to the levy of an income tax. To make this\r\nunpopular tax more acceptable a number of minor mischievous taxes were\r\nabolished. Thus rendered palatable, this bill, too, was carried through\r\nParliament with tolerable speed, and was passed with handsome majorities by\r\nboth Houses. It called for a tax of sevenpence on every pound of annual\r\nincome above £150.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Copyright reform]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Lays of Ancient Rome\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Locksley Hall\"]\r\n\r\nIn emulation of the new provisions for copyright in France, a bill was\r\nbrought in to extend English copyright from twenty-eight to forty-two\r\nyears. Among the considerations which prompted Parliament to perform this\r\nlong delayed act of justice was the recent lamented death of Sir Walter\r\nScott. The royalties on his works were the only resource left to his\r\nfamily, and the copyright on the most important of them, the Waverley\r\nNovels, was about to expire. Southey, the Poet Laureate, before his recent\r\nillness, it was stated, had been deterred from undertaking a projected\r\ngreat work by the unsatisfactory copyright provisions. Wordsworth was about\r\nto lose the fruits of some of his earliest and most patriotic poems. Among\r\nthose who actively pressed the measure were Charles Dickens and Thomas\r\nCarlyle. The sixty years' copyright demanded in Carlyle's petition was not\r\nobtained; but authors were allowed to retain the property of their works\r\nduring life, while their heirs could possess it for seven years after their\r\ndeath. Coincident with this literary victory came other triumphs in\r\nliterature. Thomas B. Macaulay published his \"Lays of Ancient Rome\"; Alfred\r\nTennyson brought out \"Locksley Hall\" and other poems; Bulwer Lytton\r\nfinished \"Zanoni\"; the new Shakespeare Society issued some twenty volumes\r\nof researches. A new impetus to the making of books and printing was given\r\nby Woolwich's new system of electrotyping, and Charles Young's new device\r\nof a type-setting machine, first employed on the \"Family Herald.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then, too, that Dr. Julius Robert Meyer, an obscure physician in\r\nHeilbronn, published a paper in Liebig's \"Annalen,\" entitled \"The Force of\r\nInorganic Nature.\" Not merely the mechanical theory of heat, but the entire\r\ndoctrine of the conservation of energy was clearly formulated. It is true\r\nthat he was anticipated in a measure by Mohr, and that Helmholtz more\r\nexhaustively demonstrated the truth of the hypothesis of the conservation\r\nof energy; but Helmholtz himself hailed Meyer as the rightful claimant of\r\nthe honor of having first clearly formulated the doctrine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Charter petition]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Sacred Month\"]\r\n\r\nA great gain for humanity was made in Lord Ashley's successful bill for the\r\nrestriction of work done by women and children in mines and collieries.\r\nUnder the leadership of O'Connell's former Irish rival, Feargus O'Connor,\r\nthe agitation for a People's Charter was revived. On May 2, another monster\r\npetition, containing nearly three and a half million signatures, was rolled\r\ninto Parliament. Too voluminous to pass through the doors, it had to be cut\r\nup and carried into the hall by sixteen men. A motion to consider it was\r\nviolently opposed by Macaulay. Once more the petition was rejected by 287\r\nover 49 votes. Now followed one of the most singular labor strikes of\r\nEngland. This was the so-called sacred month, or thirty days' idleness to\r\nbe enforced throughout the United Kingdom. Within a few days the Chartists\r\ncould boast that for fifty miles round Manchester every loom was still. The\r\nattempt to extend the strike to London was followed by the arrest of\r\nO'Connor and nearly a hundred of his associates. They were tried and\r\nconvicted, but owing to a flaw in the indictment sentence could not be\r\ncarried out. The agitation was made to appear more serious by two attempts\r\nto assassinate the Queen in May and July, but the young Queen was not\r\ndeterred thereby from making her first visit to Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese opium war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Chapoo]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shanghai occupied]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assault of Chinkiangfoo]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: China brought to terms]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty ports designated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opium forced upon China]\r\n\r\nIn August, the Duke of Wellington was reinstated as commander-in-chief of\r\nthe British army. Among the military reforms undertaken was the general\r\nintroduction of the percussion-cap musket in the infantry, and the use of\r\nthe carbine in the artillery. The war in China was brought to a close. The\r\nlong period of inaction following the occupation of Ningpo had been broken\r\nin March by Chinese attempts to recapture Ningpo, Chinhai and Chusan. In\r\nall three places the British beat off their assailants. At Ningpo the\r\nChinese succeeded in breaking through the south and west gates, and reached\r\nthe centre of the city only to be mowed down there by the British\r\nartillery. At Tszeki a strong Chinese camp was captured by the British. The\r\nChinese losses on this occasion were over a thousand killed, including many\r\nof the Imperial Guards. The British casualties did not exceed forty. A\r\nnaval expedition next attacked Chapoo, China's port of trade with Japan.\r\nThe main body of the Chinese was routed, but 300 of their soldiers shut\r\nthemselves up in a walled inclosure, and held their ground until\r\nthree-fourths of their number were slain. As heretofore, the British\r\ncasualties were small. The important city of Shanghai was captured without\r\nappreciable resistance. The most serious affair of the war was the attack\r\non Chinkiangfoo on the southern bank of the Yangtse-Kiang at one of the\r\nentrances of the great canal. A part of the Manchu garrison held out there\r\nuntil shot down to the last man. The inner Tartar city was only taken after\r\nthe Manchus had first killed the women and children and then themselves.\r\nThe immediate losses of the British were nearly two hundred. Owing to the\r\nintense heat, they failed to bury the bodies of the Chinese. Pestilence and\r\ncholera broke out, and caused more serious losses than befell the main\r\nforce sent against Nanking. On August 5, the British fleet appeared before\r\nNanking, the second city of the empire. It was then that Minister Elepoo,\r\nthe leader of the Chinese peace party, prevailed upon Emperor Taouk-Wang to\r\ngive in. On August 26, peace was concluded on board the British flagship\r\n\"Cornwallis.\" China paid an indemnity of $21,000,000, and confirmed the\r\ncession of Hong Kong to England. The English opium factory at Canton was to\r\nbe reinstalled, and, in addition to this, foreign trading was to be allowed\r\nat the ports of Shanghai, Ningpo, Amhoy and Foochow, after a tariff should\r\nhave been agreed upon and consular officers appointed. The final ceremonies\r\nof peace were marred by barbarous injuries inflicted upon the famous\r\nporcelain tower of Nanking by a party of British officers and soldiers. In\r\nthe words of a British historian: \"The only weak point in the commercial\r\ntreaty was that it contained no reference to opium. Sir Henry Pottinger\r\nfailed to obtain the assent of the Chinese government to its legalization.\"\r\nIn reply to Sir Henry Pottinger's final demand for legalization of the\r\nopium trade in China, Emperor Taouk-Wang delivered this ultimatum: \"True, I\r\ncannot prevent the introduction of the poison; but nothing will induce me\r\nto raise revenue from the vice and misery of my people.\" The emperor,\r\nhimself a reformed opium smoker, had lost three sons by this vice. All this\r\ntime American, Dutch and Russian trade with China had been continued.\r\nPresident Tyler made it the subject of his message to the American Congress\r\nduring this year. From the first any American traffic in opium was\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Webster-Ashburton agreement]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Battle of the Maps\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American interests in Hawaii]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daniel Webster resigns]\r\n\r\nThe Webster-Ashburton treaty, regulating the northeastern boundary between\r\nthe United States and Canada, was signed on August 9. A strip of territory\r\nclaimed by the State of Maine was ceded to Canada, while a more important\r\nstrip was yielded to Vermont and New York. The treaty also provided for a\r\njoint repressive action against the slave trade, and for the extradition of\r\ncriminals. It was Webster's greatest achievement in diplomacy, as was\r\nindicated by the fact that the American Senate, notwithstanding its\r\nhostility to President Tyler, ratified it by a three-fourths vote. In\r\nEngland more serious opposition was encountered. In Parliament the treaty\r\nwas termed \"Ashburton's Capitulation,\" and Lord Palmerston went so far as\r\nto attribute its concessions to Ashburton's partiality toward his American\r\nwife. The ratification of the treaty was followed by an international\r\ncontroversy known as \"The Battle of the Maps.\" An early map found by Jared\r\nSparks, the American historian, in the Library of Paris, had been used in\r\nthe Senate to insure the ratification of the treaty without the knowledge\r\nof Lord Ashburton. When this became known in England it was denounced as\r\nunderhand dealing. Frantic search in the archives of the British Museum\r\nbrought to light another map, bearing the autograph indorsement of King\r\nGeorge III. As it turned out, this only sustained the American contentions,\r\nand was used in Parliament to vindicate Lord Ashburton, just as Sparks's\r\nmap had been used in behalf of Webster. Credit also belongs to Webster for\r\nhis strong stand made at the time the Hawaiian Islands were threatened by\r\na French expedition. It was then stated, as reiterated by President Tyler\r\nto Congress, that, in view of the preponderant intercourse of the United\r\nStates with those islands, the American government would insist that no\r\nEuropean nation should colonize or possess them, nor subvert the native\r\ngovernments. After a settlement of these international questions, Daniel\r\nWebster was permitted to resign his secretaryship to join the Whig\r\nopposition on the floor of the House. His resignation was the more readily\r\naccepted since he was known to be out of harmony with the Administration's\r\ndesigns against Mexico. As the son of President Tyler has recorded: \"The\r\ntime had come when it was necessary to have in the office of the Secretary\r\nof State one who would go the full length of the Texas question. Certainly,\r\nthat man was not Webster.\" In the Senate, Henry Clay resigned his seat, the\r\nbetter to carry on his canvass as a candidate for the Presidency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First American submarine cable]\r\n\r\nAt the time that Charles Dickens paid his first visit to America the\r\nagitation for a better copyright law was renewed, and was in a measure\r\nsuccessful. Dickens's early impressions of the United States, as published\r\nlater in England, were distinctly unfavorable to the American people. Had\r\nhe lingered longer he might have witnessed the laying of the first\r\nsubmarine telegraph between Governor's Island and New York City. In the\r\nextreme West another outlet toward the Pacific Ocean was found by Fremont\r\nand Kit Carson in the south pass of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Latin-American affairs]\r\n\r\nIn Central America, General Morazan invaded Costa Rica to re-establish by\r\nforce the federation of the Central American States. At first he was\r\nwelcomed by the population and recognized as President of Costa Rica. But\r\nlater, as the guerilla war dragged itself out, the opposition gained\r\nground. José Maria Alfaro was recognized as President. In South America,\r\nGeneral Rosas made another attempt to subject Montevideo. Gold was\r\ndiscovered in Uruguay. In the West Indies, the restoration of peace in Cuba\r\nwas followed by educational, far-reaching reforms. Another revolution in\r\nHayti provoked French interference.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French-Algerian campaign]\r\n\r\nThe French squadron that had made demonstrations in the Caribbean Sea\r\npresently descended upon the Marqueso Islands in the southern Pacific. The\r\nislands were annexed to France. In Africa, the war against Abd-el-Kader was\r\npushed forward. The Arabs attacked Mostaganem and Arzee and lured Yussuf,\r\nthe commander of the new French corps of native Spahis, into an ambush.\r\nGeneral Vallè, with a division of 9,000 men, drove Abd-el-Kader from an\r\nintrenched pass between Medah and Muzaia; but the French lost heavily. The\r\nAlgerian war during this year alone cost 12,000 lives and 50,000,000\r\nfrancs. Vallè was superseded by Bugeaud.\r\n\r\nThe French general elections had just resulted in favor of the government,\r\nwhen, on July 13, the Duke of Orleans was killed by a fall from his\r\ncarriage. After this event the Chambers fixed the succession to the throne\r\nupon the Duke of Nemours, until the children of the Duke of Orleans should\r\nbe of age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Blanc]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proudhon]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eugène Sue]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Stendhal\"]\r\n\r\nBy this time the socialistic theories of Saint Simon and Fourier were\r\nexploited still further by Louis Blanc and Proudhon. Blanc's writings had\r\nan immense vogue among the workmen of Paris. This was especially true of\r\nhis \"Organisation du Travail,\" published this year, wherein he proclaimed\r\nthe opportunity to work as a social right. Proudhon carried Etienne Cadet's\r\n\"Icarian\" theories so far that in his famous book, \"What is Property?\"\r\nafter describing the conditions under which property is held according to\r\nthe Napoleonic Code, he delivered the categorical dictum, \"If this be\r\nproperty, then property is theft.\" Other popular books of the day were\r\nEugène Sue's \"The Mysteries of Paris,\" \"Le Morne au Diable,\" and Georges\r\nSand's famous novel \"Consuelo.\" Marie Henri Beyle, known better under his\r\npseudonym, \"Stendhal,\" died during this year. As a novelist he was the\r\nprecursor of the naturalistic school of romance in France, and was later\r\nacknowledged as such by Balzac, Flaubert and Emile Zola. His powers of\r\nprose were most ably demonstrated in the novel \"Rouge et Noir,\" treating of\r\nthe adventures of a worldly Abbé.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cherubini]\r\n\r\nAnother notable figure in Paris passed away with Luigi Cherubini, the great\r\nItalian composer. Cherubini, many of whose works were brought out during\r\nthe previous century was so popular by the beginning of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury, that he was esteemed above Beethoven. A Viennese critic who\r\nventured to say that Beethoven's \"Fidelio\" was of equal merit with\r\nCherubini's \"Fanisca\" was laughed to scorn. Cherubini's best opera, \"The\r\nWater Carrier,\" was brought out in Paris and London in 1800 and 1801. Owing\r\nto his disregard of Napoleon's musical opinions, Cherubini found himself\r\nout of favor throughout the First Empire in France. He retired to the\r\nestate of his friend, Prince de Chimay, and would have given up music but\r\nfor the latter's request to write a Mass for his chapel. The result was the\r\ncelebrated three-part Mass in F, which proved such a success that Cherubini\r\nthenceforward devoted himself to sacred music. After Napoleon's fall he\r\nreceived an appointment at the Paris Conservatory of Music, from the\r\ndirectorship of which he did not retire until 1841. Cherubini's voluminous\r\ncompositions reveal him as one of the great modern masters of counterpoint.\r\nHis great skill and erudition show to the best advantage in his sacred\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bunsen]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gervinus]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forecasts of German union]\r\n\r\nGermany about this same time lost her great Oriental scholar, F.W.\r\nGenesius. Bunsen invented his carbon battery. Gervinus, the banished\r\nHanoverian professor, brought out his History of German Literature, which\r\nended with a stirring appeal for political unity. The same ideal, in a\r\nmeasure, was voiced during the ceremonies commemorating the resumption of\r\nwork on the great Cathedral of Cologne. King Frederick William IV. of\r\nPrussia, fresh from the riots of Berlin, declared: \"The spirit that builds\r\nthis cathedral is the same that has broken our chains, and the disgrace of\r\nforeign domination over this German river--it is the spirit of German\r\nstrength and unity.\" Even Archduke John, the uncle of the Emperor of\r\nAustria, proposed this toast: \"No Austria, no Prussia; but a great united\r\nGermany--firm-rooted as her mountains.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reforms in Russia]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gogol]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turgenyev]\r\n\r\nIn Russia, a concession to modern ideas was made by Czar Nicholas, in his\r\nukase of April 14, permitting the great landholders to liberate their\r\nserfs. Another imperial ukase deprived the Roman as well as the Greek\r\nclergy of all church lands upon condemnation proceedings and money payments\r\nby the government. Russian literature, notwithstanding the strict\r\ncensorship, flourished during this period. A new source of poetry was\r\ndiscovered by Koltsov in the Slavic folk songs. Griboyodov's new comedy,\r\n\"Gore Ot Ouma\" (Too Clever by Half), had already become one of the stock\r\npieces. The success of this play was rivalled by Gogol's comedy, \"The\r\nRevisor.\" In 1842, this same writer brought out his celebrated romance,\r\n\"Dead Souls.\" Ivan Turgenyev was just entering upon his career.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the year new troubles broke out in Spain. In November,\r\na popular insurrection at Barcelona was joined by the National Guards.\r\nFollowing upon a bitter fight in the streets of the city, on November 15,\r\nthe Guards retired into the citadel, where they held their ground. After\r\none month's stubborn resistance there, they were subjected to such heavy\r\nartillery fire that they were glad to surrender to Espartero's government\r\nforces on Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1843\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napier's desert march]\r\n\r\nTo carry on the British war with Afghanistan it was necessary to pass\r\ntroops through Scinde. The Ameers remonstrated. Emaun-Ghur, in the Desert\r\nof Beluchistan, was a stronghold where the Ameers could gather a numerous\r\narmy unobserved by the English. Sir Charles Napier determined to strike for\r\nthis point with a small force, capable of speedily traversing the desert.\r\nOn the night of January 5, he commenced his perilous adventure. With 360\r\nIrish soldiers on camels, with 200 of the irregular cavalry, with ten\r\ncamels laden with provisions, and with eighty carrying water, he set forth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emaun-Ghur reduced]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Meanee]\r\n\r\nWhen the fortress, which no European eye had before seen, was reached, it\r\nwas found deserted. Immense stores of ammunition had been left behind.\r\nNapier mined Emaun-Ghur in twenty-four places, and blew up all the mighty\r\nwalls of its square tower. After great privations on the march back, Napier\r\nand his men rejoined the main army on the 23d near Hyderabad. The Duke of\r\nWellington said that the march to Emaun-Ghur was one of the most arduous\r\nmilitary feats of which he knew. On February 12, the Ameers at Hyderabad,\r\nwho, according to the British Resident himself, had been \"cruelly\r\nwronged,\" came to terms. On the day after their apparent submission the\r\nBritish Resident, Major Outram, was attacked by the infuriated Beluchees.\r\nWith a hundred followers he barely succeeded in fighting his way through to\r\ntwo British war steamers lying in the river. Napier, with his 2,600 men,\r\nnow moved against the Beluchee army, numbering nearly 10,000. On February\r\n17, the day of the battle of Meanee, Napier wrote in his journal: \"It is my\r\nfirst battle as a commander. It may be my last. At sixty it makes little\r\ndifference what my feelings are. It shall be do or die.\" It proved an\r\nall-day fight. Most of the white officers fell. In the end, Napier closed\r\nthe doubtful struggle by a decisive cavalry charge. The Sepoy horsemen\r\ncharged through the Beluchee army and stormed the batteries on the ridge of\r\nthe hill of Meanee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hyderabad]\r\n\r\nNapier followed up his victory the next day by a message sent into\r\nHyderabad that he would storm the city unless it surrendered. Six of the\r\nAmeers came out and laid their swords at his feet. Another enemy\r\nremained--Shere Mahomed of Meerpoor. On March 24, Napier, with 5,000\r\ntroops, attacked this chief, who had come with 20,000 Beluchees before the\r\nwalls of Hyderabad. Napier won another brilliant victory, which was\r\nfollowed up by the British occupation of Meerpoor. The spirit of the\r\nBeluchees was so broken that after two slight actions in June, when Shere\r\nMahomed was routed and fled into the desert, the war was at an end. Scinde\r\nwas annexed to the British Empire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English free-trade agitation]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irish disaffection]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: O'Connell arrested]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anti-corn law league]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mill's \"System of Logic\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Southey]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ballad of Blenheim]\r\n\r\nAt home, in the meanwhile, the Chartist agitation, with its \"sacred month\"\r\nstrike, was carried over into this year, while the leaders were tried\r\nbefore the Lancashire Assizes. Popular meetings were held at Birmingham,\r\nManchester and London. O'Connor, after his suspension of sentence in court,\r\nmade the mistake of setting himself against the anti-corn law agitation led\r\nby Cobden and Bright. To most Englishmen of the day the free-trade issue\r\nappeared the most momentous. O'Connor's star paled accordingly. Early in\r\nthe year a new free-trade hall had been opened in London, the largest room\r\nfor public meetings in the United Kingdom. A dozen lecturers were kept\r\nbusy. Cobden alone addressed some thirty great country meetings during the\r\nfirst half of the year. At the same time the Irish agitation for repeal of\r\nthe legislative union with England assumed formidable proportions. The\r\nIrish secret society of the \"Molly Maguires\" spread alarmingly. On March\r\n16, Daniel O'Connell addressed 30,000 persons at Trim, urging repeal of the\r\nact of united legislation for Ireland and Great Britain. A few months later\r\nseveral hundred thousand people gathered on the hill of Tara to listen to\r\nhis eloquent words. As a result of this agitation, O'Connell, with several\r\nof his followers, was arrested, in October, on charges of sedition.\r\nSimultaneously with this the so-called \"Becca Riots\" against turnpikes\r\nbroke out in Wales. One month after O'Connell's arrest the greatest\r\nfree-trade meeting of the year was held at Manchester. Both Cobden and\r\nBright made speeches against the corn laws. One hundred thousand pounds\r\nwere collected on the spot from wealthy manufacturers who attended the\r\nmeeting. This opened the eyes even of the editors of the London \"Times.\"\r\nUnder the caption \"The League is a Great Fact,\" it announced that a new\r\npower had arisen in the State. This reluctant concession of the leading\r\nTory paper of England caused a great sensation. Other events that excited\r\nthe attention of Englishmen were the erection of the great Nelson column in\r\nTrafalgar Square and the opening of the Thames tunnel for pedestrians.\r\nThousands of curious Londoners passed through its shaft, measuring 1,300\r\nfeet in length. Nasmyth invented his steam hammer. Mill published his\r\n\"System of Logic.\" The event of the year in English letters was the death\r\nof Robert Southey, the Poet Laureate. During the last few years his brain\r\nhad softened, and his mind had become enfeebled. Southey was born at\r\nBristol in 1774. He was educated at Westminster School and Baliol College,\r\nOxford. While still at college he brought out two volumes of poems,\r\ntogether with Robert Lovell. His first long narrative poem, \"Joan of Arc,\"\r\nwas written at the age of nineteen, and gave him, as he called it, \"a\r\nBaxter's shove into the right place in the world.\" At the opening of the\r\nNineteenth Century, he published the \"wild and wondrous song\" of \"Thalaba,\r\nthe Destroyer,\" founded on Moslem mythology. \"Kehema,\" founded on Hindu\r\nlore, followed. In 1803, after some years of wandering, the poet went to\r\nlive at Greta Hall, near Keswick, which remained his home until his death.\r\nBesides a long line of prose works, Southey wrote innumerable short poems.\r\nFamous among them is the ballad of the battle of Blenheim, with its homely\r\nirony:\r\n\r\n  \"With fire and sword the country round\r\n  Was wasted far and wide,\r\n  And many a childing mother then\r\n  And new-born baby died;\r\n  But things like that, you know, must be\r\n  At every famous victory.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brilliant occasional pieces]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southey's works]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Stanzas in My Library\"]\r\n\r\nSouthey nourished a passionate hatred against Napoleon Bonaparte. Again and\r\nagain he invoked the Muse against the world conqueror. Thus he wrote to\r\nLandor in 1814: \"For five years I have been preaching the policy, the duty,\r\nthe necessity of declaring Bonaparte under the ban of human nature.\" Under\r\nthis stress of feeling he wrote his great \"Ode During the Negotiations for\r\nPeace.\" It was the most powerful of his occasional pieces. In 1813, he was\r\nmade Poet Laureate. As such, it fell to him to write another occasional\r\npiece on the death of the Princess Charlotte. The grace and beauty of his\r\nlines on this occasion have long outlived the memory of that lamented\r\nprincess. Unlike his great contemporaries, Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott,\r\nSouthey never achieved a great material success. Having married young, he\r\noften walked the streets, so he himself confessed, \"not having eighteen\r\npence for a dinner, nor bread and cheese at his lodgings.\" In 1835, when he\r\nwas sixty-one years old, he wrote to Sir Robert Peel while declining the\r\noffer of a baronetcy, \"Last year for the first time in my life I was\r\nprovided with a year's expenditure beforehand.\" Yet his works at this time\r\nfilled nearly a hundred volumes. In the words of his brother poets:\r\n\r\n     \"Southey's epics crammed the creaking shelves.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in his declining age that he wrote the prophetic \"Stanzas Written in\r\nMy Library\":\r\n\r\n  My days among the Dead are passed:\r\n    Around me I behold,\r\n  Where'er these casual eyes are cast,\r\n    The almighty minds of old;\r\n  My never-failing friends are they,\r\n    With whom I converse day by day.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  My hopes are with the Dead, anon\r\n    My place with them will be,\r\n  And I with them shall travel on\r\n    Through all Futurity;\r\n  Yet leaving here a name, I trust,\r\n    That will not perish in the dust.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wordsworth, Poet Laureate]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Lost Leader\"]\r\n\r\nAfter Southey's death, William Wordsworth was made Poet Laureate. His\r\nacceptance of this benefice from the government incensed his more radical\r\nfriends. Robert Browning then wrote the famous invective lines entitled\r\n\"The Lost Leader\":\r\n\r\n  Just for a handful of silver he left us,\r\n    Just for a ribbon to stick in his coat--\r\n  Found the one gift of which fortune bereft us,\r\n    Lost all the others, she lets us devote;\r\n  They, with the gold to give, doled him out silver,\r\n    So much was theirs who so little allowed:\r\n  How all our copper had gone for his service!\r\n    Rags--were they purple, his heart had been proud!\r\n  We that had loved him so, followed him, honored him,\r\n    Lived in his mild and magnificent eye,\r\n  Learned his great language, caught his clear accents,\r\n    Made him our pattern to live and to die!\r\n  Shakespeare was of us, Milton was for us,\r\n    Burns, Shelley, were with us--they watch from their graves!\r\n  He alone breaks from the van and the freemen,\r\n    He alone sinks to the rear and the slaves!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prescott's \"Conquest of Mexico\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edgar Allan Poe]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Gold Bug\"]\r\n\r\nAmerica this year lost three of her prominent literary men by the deaths of\r\nAllston, the poet and painter, Noah Webster, the lexicographer, and Key,\r\nthe author of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" The historian Prescott now\r\nbrought out his great \"Conquest of Mexico.\" Longfellow published his\r\n\"Spanish Student.\" Edgar Allan Poe entered upon his new journalistic\r\nventure \"The Stylus.\" For this he wrote his stories of \"The Tell-Tale\r\nHeart,\" \"Leonore,\" and his \"Notes upon English Verse.\" For other\r\npublications he wrote \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and the striking poem,\r\n\"The Conqueror Worm.\" His fearful tale of the \"Black Cat\" was published in\r\nthe \"Saturday Evening Post.\" At this time he was ailing in health, while\r\nhis young wife, Virginia, was dying. During these trying months his\r\nprincipal income was a hundred dollar prize received for his famous story\r\nof \"The Gold Bug,\" published in the \"Dollar Newspaper.\" The judges\r\nconfessed later that they awarded the prize to this contribution largely on\r\naccount of its neat handwriting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oregon controversy]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texas unannexed]\r\n\r\nOn June 17, the new Bunker Hill Monument of Boston was dedicated amid\r\nimpressive ceremonies. Daniel Webster, who as a young man had spoken there\r\nwhen the cornerstone was laid by Lafayette, was once more the orator of the\r\nday. In the South, Jefferson Davis began his political career as a member\r\nof the Mississippi Convention, as did Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, who was\r\nthen elected to Congress. The pending negotiations with Great Britain\r\nconcerning the possession of Oregon were made more momentous by the exodus\r\nof some thousand American emigrants from Missouri, on an overland journey\r\nto distant Oregon. The first session of the Thirty-eighth Congress, in\r\nDecember, showed a Democratic majority in the House of sixty-nine votes.\r\nUnder the Whig régime, the policy of a great navy had been developed. A\r\nbill for a large increase in ships was passed. Tyler's last message\r\nrecommended the annexation of Texas, for which a treaty was pending. It was\r\nvoted down in the Senate by a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Central-American upheavals]\r\n\r\nUnder the shadow of impending war with the United States, a new\r\nConstitution was proclaimed in Mexico. Santa Anna prepared for the conflict\r\nby assuming the practical powers of a dictator. In Ecuador, too, a new\r\nConstitution was adopted. General Flores had himself made President for a\r\nthird time. When the opposition to him became too formidable, he consented\r\nto yield and quit the country after accepting a bonus of $20,000 and the\r\ntitle of generalissimo. Another revolution in Hayti resulted in the\r\nexpulsion of President Boyer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Spain]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Isabella proclaimed queen]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish marriage projects]\r\n\r\nIn Spain a revolutionary junta in June once more assumed power at\r\nBarcelona. Other parts of the country declared for the ex-Queen Regent\r\nChristina. On July 15, General Narvaez compelled the surrender of Madrid to\r\nChristina. General Espartero laid siege to Seville. On November 8, the\r\nSpanish Cortes proclaimed as queen, Princess Isabella, then in her\r\nthirteenth year. With the crown of Spain on the head of a young girl, and\r\nno immediate successor in sight but her sister, the King of France and his\r\nPrime Minister, Guizot, deemed the time ripe for action. It was proposed to\r\nmarry both Spanish princesses to the sons of Louis Philippe, so as to\r\nsecure the throne of Spain to the House of Orleans, as it had once been\r\nsecured to that of Bourbon. For the French people the interest in Spain was\r\nrevived by Gautier's new book, \"Tras los Montes.\" During the negotiations\r\nover the new extradition treaty with England, the project was\r\nconfidentially broached to Lord Aberdeen. He gave his consent to the\r\nproposed marriage of the Duke of Montpensier to the Infanta Fernanda, on\r\nthe express understanding that it should not be celebrated until Queen\r\nIsabella had been married herself, and had children. For some time still\r\nthe plan hung fire.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Hungary was once more in uproar. Kossuth, after his\r\nrelease from prison in 1840, had become the spokesman of the new generation\r\nof Magyars. The other wings of the Hungarian party were led by Scechenyi\r\nand Déak.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE EMPEROR OF CHINA RECEIVING THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hungarian reform movement]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clash at Agram]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kossuth's oratory]\r\n\r\nBy the time the Hungarian Diet of 1843 was convoked, all parties united in\r\ndemanding the most important reforms, _i.e._ of a new electoral system, a\r\nnew criminal code, trial by jury, and official recognition of the Magyar\r\nlanguage. One of the first resolutions of the Lower Chamber was that no\r\nlanguage but Magyar should be permitted in debate, and that all persons\r\nincapable of speaking Magyar should gradually be excluded from all public\r\nemployment. Against the prohibition of Latin in the Diet, the Croatians\r\nappealed to the government. The Emperor promptly vetoed the resolution.\r\nUpon the publication of the imperial rescript a popular storm broke forth\r\nin Hungary. At Agram, the capital of Croatia, the two factions fought on\r\nthe streets. The Austrian Cabinet receded from its position. A compromise\r\nwas accepted whereby Latin was to be permitted in the Hungarian Diet for\r\nthe next six years. Of all the important schemes for reform brought before\r\nthe Hungarian Diet of this year, only the language compromise became law.\r\nThis was due to the fact that the members of the Lower House were bound to\r\nvote as directed by the Provincial Assemblies, which vetoed everything\r\naffecting their local interests. To do away with this anomaly Kossuth and\r\nhis followers now set themselves to bring their appeal before the country\r\nat large. Kossuth dropped the pen and became an orator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Algerian campaign]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Foreign Legion\" formed]\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the world the spread of Western civilization was carried\r\non with accustomed vigor. A French squadron seized Tahiti in the Society\r\nIslands. In Algiers the war against Abd-el-Kader was kept alive by\r\noccasional raids and by buying over the less faithful of his followers. The\r\nnatives were enrolled in the French army in regiments of Turcos, Zouaves\r\nand Spahis. The barbaric glamour of their oriental garb, as well as the\r\nreputation of their dashing leader, Colonel Lamorcière, attracted many\r\nFrenchmen and foreign adventurers to this service. Soon there were enough\r\nmen to form the famous \"Foreign Legion.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese treaty ports opened]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British seize Sindia]\r\n\r\nIn China, after the ratification of the Nanking treaty, the five treaty\r\nports were opened to all foreigners on the same footing as to Englishmen.\r\nLong before this, the Russians had already established themselves in\r\ncertain parts of China. The smouldering resentment against the white men\r\nfound vent in the truculent doings of the anti-foreign society of the\r\n\"Green Water Lily\" in Hoonan. Now trouble broke out in the Punjab. Jankoji\r\nBao Sindia had died in February, and his widow, a girl of twelve, now ruled\r\nover the Sikhs. She outwitted her native Minister, who was supported by the\r\nBritish. Lord Ellenborough hastened to interfere. He ordered the British\r\narmy to advance to Gwalior, under Sir Hugh Gough, in December. All Sindia\r\nmade common cause against the foreigner. The Sikh warriors tried to oppose\r\nthe British advance in two simultaneous battles at Maharajpore and Punniar,\r\nfought on the twenty-ninth day of December. Both engagements resulted in\r\ntheir defeat. The Queen and her Ministers submitted to England's terms.\r\nThey were deposed. The Sikh army was reduced to 6,000 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1844\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texas]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calhoun becomes Secretary of State]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texan annexation rejected]\r\n\r\nTyler's scheme for the annexation of Texas to the North American Union was\r\nuppermost in American affairs from the outset of this year. After the\r\nretirement of Daniel Webster from the State Department, active efforts\r\ntoward that end were begun. The Mexican Government, learning of this\r\nmovement, notified the United States that annexation would be regarded as a\r\ncause for war. Texas first asked for American interference, and, failing in\r\nthis, came to an agreement with Great Britain. In return for England's\r\naction in securing the recognition of independence by Mexico, Texas pledged\r\nitself not to be annexed to any other country. This agreement was approved\r\nin Mexico. The Texan debt was largely owed in England, and it was the\r\npolicy of Lord Aberdeen, accordingly, to encourage her independence. In\r\nFebruary, a note by Lord Aberdeen was transmitted to the American\r\nGovernment, stating that Great Britain desired to see slavery abolished in\r\nTexas, as elsewhere, but disclaimed any intention unduly to force that\r\npoint. This statement in itself whetted the desire of the Southern States\r\nof the Union to incorporate Texas among the slave-holding States. Calhoun,\r\nwho as early as 1836 had demanded the annexation of Texas on behalf of the\r\ninterests of Southern slavery, was invited to join Tyler's Cabinet as\r\nSecretary of State. The office had been rendered vacant by the calamitous\r\nexplosion of a new monster gun on the U.S.S. \"Princeton,\" killing Secretary\r\nof State Upshar and Secretary Gilmer of the Navy in the immediate vicinity\r\nof President Tyler. Calhoun entered office on March 6, and on April 12 the\r\nTexan treaty of annexation was signed. On April 18, Calhoun answered Lord\r\nAberdeen's note, declaring that \"the British avowal made it the imperious\r\nduty of the Federal Government to conclude in self-defence a treaty of\r\nannexation with Texas.\" As to this transaction, Von Holst, Calhoun's\r\nbiographer, has said: \"It may not be correct to apply, without\r\nmodification, the code of private ethics to politics; but, however flexible\r\npolitical morality may be, a lie is a lie, and Calhoun knew there was not a\r\nparticle of truth in these assertions.\" The annexation treaty was held back\r\nin the American Senate until the Democratic Convention of 1844 had declared\r\nfor the reannexation of Texas. In the hope that this would secure\r\nratification the treaty was submitted in June, but the Senate once more\r\nrejected it by 35 to 16 votes. Undismayed by this, President Tyler within\r\nthree days sent another message to the House of Representatives asking for\r\nreconsideration of the subject, but the matter went over until after the\r\nPresidential campaign in the autumn. Henry Clay's vacillating stand\r\nthroughout this controversy proved fatal to his Presidential aspirations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anti-Mormon riots]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brigham Young]\r\n\r\nDuring this same year, the Indians surrendered the regions adjoining Lake\r\nSuperior, which were promptly settled by white men. Iron was then\r\ndiscovered at Marquette and copper at Kewenaw Point. At Nauvoo, Illinois,\r\nwhere the Mormons had just erected a temple, their revival of patriarchal\r\npolygamy excited the wrath of the people. Riots broke out June 27. The\r\nMormon leader, Joseph Smith, and his brother, who had been lodged in jail,\r\nwere killed. Brigham Young thenceforth became the leader of the Mormons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morse's telegraph]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wells' anæsthetic discovery]\r\n\r\nBy means of a Congressional grant of $30,000, Samuel B.F. Morse constructed\r\nhis first telegraph line over the forty miles between Baltimore and\r\nWashington. The first message, \"What hath God wrought?\" is still preserved\r\nby the Connecticut Historical Society. Before this Alfred Vail had\r\nperfected his telegraph code of alphabetical signs, with his dry point\r\nreading register and relay key. Now Ezra Cornell contributed his invention\r\nof an inverted cup of glass for insulating live wires. Dr. Horace Wells, a\r\ndentist of Hartford, Connecticut, first employed nitrous oxide gas,\r\npopularly known as laughing gas, in extracting one of his own teeth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of John Dalton]\r\n\r\nIn England, Faraday published his first \"Experimental Researches in\r\nElectricity.\" The anonymous publication of \"Vestiges of the Natural History\r\nof Creation,\" containing the first enunciation of Darwin's doctrine of the\r\norigin of species by evolution, was followed by a storm of controversy.\r\nAnother subject for controversy was furnished by the invention of the new\r\ntonic system in music (Do re mi fa). Kingsley brought out his \"Village\r\nSermons,\" while Max Müller came into prominence by his new edition and\r\ntranslation of \"Hitopadesa,\" a collection of old Hindu fables. The\r\nnecrology of the year in England includes John Dalton, the physicist, and\r\nSir Francis Burdett, the parliamentarian and popular leader, who did so\r\nmuch for liberty of speech and of the press. John Dalton, a strangely\r\noriginal genius, and perhaps the greatest theoretical chemist of his\r\ngeneration, first came into prominence by showing that water existed in air\r\nas an independent gas. The wonderful theory of atoms, on which the whole\r\ngigantic structure of modern chemistry rests, was the logical outgrowth of\r\nthe original conception of this country-bred, self-taught Quaker.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: O'Connell's trial]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Government monopoly of English railways]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Y.M.C.A. founded]\r\n\r\nA feature of the year was the sensational trial of Daniel O'Connell and his\r\nassociates on charges of sedition in Ireland. On May 30, O'Connell was\r\nsentenced to imprisonment for one year and fined £2,000. After Lord\r\nHeytesbury's advent as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland the judgment of the Irish\r\nCourt of Queen's Bench against O'Connell was reversed and O'Connell and his\r\nassociates were liberated. Baring's bill for a renewal of the Bank of\r\nEngland's charter was passed with a handsome government majority. The new\r\nRoyal Exchange was opened by the Queen in October. Another measure which\r\nwas speedily passed through Parliament, owing to the slight importance\r\nattached to it, was Gladstone's bill requiring the railroads of England to\r\nprovide proper accommodations and to run cheap trains daily. The government\r\nwas authorized, with the approval of Parliament, to undertake the gradual\r\npurchase of all existing railways before the year 1866. At this same time\r\nthere were but fourteen miles of railroad in all British America. Minor\r\nevents of importance to Englishmen were the foundation of the Young Men's\r\nChristian Association by certain drygoods clerks of London, and the\r\ndemolition of the notorious Fleet Prison, made immortal by the novels of\r\nDickens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Secession of Santo Domingo]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold in South Australia drew hordes of immigrants to that\r\ncolony. Others were attracted to America by the discovery of diamonds in\r\nBrazil. In the West Indies, the successful rising against President Boyer\r\nof Hayti resulted in the foundation of the Black Republic of Santo Domingo.\r\nPresident Rivière, at the head of 20,000 negroes from Hayti, was defeated\r\nand had to abandon his attempt to subdue the Dominicans. Guerrier\r\nsuperseded him as President of Hayti. The warlike spirit of these negroes\r\nspread to the neighboring island of Cuba. Various armed risings of the\r\nblacks in the province of Santiago and elsewhere were sternly put down by\r\nthe Spaniards and their white descendants in Cuba.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Otto's reign in Greece]\r\n\r\nA bloodless revolution in Greece resulted in the dismissal of King Otto's\r\nBavarian Ministry and the King's acceptance of a Constitution, which left\r\nthe King almost as absolute as before. Yet his government was weak and\r\nslipshod. The wretched fiscal system and heavy taxation of the old Turkish\r\nrégime were retained, while ill-managed innovations from Bavaria, such as\r\nmilitary conscription, drove large numbers to brigandage. As an American\r\ntraveller remarked at the time: \"The whole Greek Government is one enormous\r\njob.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of Calabria]\r\n\r\nThe long-smouldering discontent of the common people in Italy and Sicily,\r\nfomented by the secret agitation of such men as Mazzini and Garibaldi,\r\nfound premature vent in a popular insurrection in Calabria. The revolt was\r\nruthlessly put down. The patriotic leaders, Attilio and Emilio Bandiero,\r\nwith eighteen others, were shot for their part in the affair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Bernadotte]\r\n\r\nOn March 8, Bernadotte, latterly known as King Charles XIV. of Sweden, died\r\nin his eighty-first year. During the last years of his reign he received\r\nmany signs of love and appreciation from his adopted people, notably on the\r\noccasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his coronation. Shortly before\r\nhis death this self-made king asserted with good reason: \"No one living has\r\nmade a career like mine.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress in Sweden]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geijer]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tegnér's \"Frithiof's Saga\"]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Bernadotte produced a new line of eminent scientists and was\r\nthe golden age of Swedish literature. Berzelius remolded the science of\r\nchemistry and founded theoretical chemistry. Elias Fries devised a new\r\nsystem of botany. Sven Nilsson, a distinguished zoologist, also became the\r\nfounder of a new science, comparative archeology. Schlyter brought out a\r\ncomplete collection of the old Scandinavian laws, a work of equal\r\nimportance to philology and jurisprudence. Ling invented the Swedish system\r\nof gymnastics and founded the Institute of Gymnastics in Stockholm, where\r\nhis Swedish massage or movement cure was further developed. Geijer, as a\r\nphilosopher, was a follower of Hoeijer, while as a historian he attained\r\nforemost rank in Sweden. As a poet and composer, Geijer also attained\r\nnoteworthy success. Professor of History at Upsala, he was accused of\r\natheism, but acquitted. His political career was equally remarkable. Geijer\r\nwas a firm supporter of the government until fifty-seven years of age, when\r\nhe joined the opposition. Swedish writers were divided in factions as\r\nopposed to each other as political parties. The old Gustavian school, of\r\nwhich Leopold remained the last representative, was attacked by the \"New\r\nSchool,\" which was inspired by German Romanticism. Of this so-called\r\n\"phosphoristic\" school Atterbom was the leader. Stagnelius, the young poet,\r\nwho died early, belonged to the same group. The New School was in turn\r\nopposed by the Gothic Society or Scandinavian School, among whom were Ling\r\nand Geijer. Franzen and Wallin devoted themselves to religious poetry. The\r\nmost famous of all modern Swedish poets was Esaias Tegnér, whose\r\n\"Frithiof's Saga\" achieved an international reputation. Politically, he was\r\nconspicuous for his inveterate hostility to the \"Holy Alliance\" and its\r\nreactionary spirit in state, church and literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oscar I. of Sweden]\r\n\r\nBernadotte's son, Oscar I., was forty-five years old when he ascended the\r\nthrone. Like his father, he was a patron of the fine arts. Upon his\r\naccession several important reforms were at once enacted by the new\r\nRiksdag. It was decided that this assembly should meet every third instead\r\nof every fifth year; the liberty of the press was extended, and equal\r\nrights were accorded to women in certain matters of inheritance and of\r\nmarriage. This last reform aroused so much criticism that a powerful\r\nopposition was organized in the Riksdag, under the leadership of\r\nHartmansdorff and Bishop Wingan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Thorvaldsen]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The great sculptor's career]\r\n\r\nAlbert Bertal Thorvaldsen, the great Danish sculptor, died suddenly on\r\nMarch 25, at Copenhagen. Thorvaldsen was the son of an Icelandic sailor,\r\nwho incidentally earned a living by carving wooden figure-heads for ships.\r\nThe boy was born at sea, in 1770, while his mother was making a voyage to\r\nCopenhagen. At the age of twenty-four, young Thorvaldsen, who had attended\r\nthe Royal Academy of Fine Arts at Copenhagen, won the grand prize, which\r\nenabled him to pursue his studies at Rome. His first work was the model of\r\na colossal statue of Jason, a marble execution of which was ordered by\r\nThomas Hope, the English banker. For this work Thorvaldsen asked six\r\nhundred sequins. Hope offered him eight hundred. Yet Thorvaldsen did not\r\nfulfil his contract with Hope until fourteen years had passed. At the house\r\nof Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt, in Rome, Thorvaldsen met Count von Moltke,\r\nwho commissioned him to execute two statues of Bacchus and Ariadne. About\r\nthe same time he made his famous \"Cupid and Psyche\" for the Countess von\r\nRonzov. The fame of these statues and others was such that the Academy of\r\nCopenhagen bestowed upon the young sculptor another prize of four hundred\r\ncrowns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Famous works]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Napoleonic order]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Morning and Night\"]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1805 Thorvaldsen made his first important bass-relief,\r\n\"The Abduction of Brisëis,\" which still remains one of the most celebrated\r\nof the sculptor's works. Orders now began to come in from all over the\r\nworld. Marquis Torlogna commissioned Thorvaldsen to make companion pieces\r\nto Canova's famous group \"Hercules and Lycas\" in the Palazzo Brazzino,\r\nwhile a government representative of the United States offered to pay five\r\nthousand crowns apiece for colossal statues of a Liberty and a Victory to\r\nbe erected in the city of Washington. These and other works Thorvaldsen was\r\nprevented from executing by his unfortunate entanglement with Signora\r\nd'Uhden, whose fits of jealousy imbittered his life. About this time the\r\nsculptor formed life-long friendships with his German fellow-sculptor,\r\nRauch, and with Prince Louis of Bavaria, who commissioned him to execute an\r\nAdonis for the Munich Museum, and to restore the Ægean marbles lately\r\nacquired by that prince. Napoleon's visit to Rome in 1811 resulted in a\r\ncharacteristic order. The Emperor left to Thorvaldsen the choice of the\r\nsubject, but gave him only three months' time wherein to finish his models.\r\nThe sculptor accordingly executed his colossal frieze presenting the \"Entry\r\nof Alexander the Great into Babylon.\" It remains one of the largest and\r\nmost ambitious of Thorvaldsen's works. It was intended for the Temple of\r\nGlory, now the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, and the price stipulated\r\nby Napoleon was 320,000 francs. Before Thorvaldsen could execute the frieze\r\nin marble, Napoleon suffered his reverses and was exiled to Elba. The\r\nBourbon Government in France refused to take the monument. A replica in\r\nmarble now adorns the Palace of Christianborg in Denmark. No less abortive\r\nwas Thorvaldsen's undertaking of a great monument intended to commemorate\r\nthe re-establishment of Poland. The monument was ordered in 1812, after\r\nNapoleon's entry into Warsaw. By the time the work was finished Poland was\r\nno more. To the year 1815 belong Thorvaldsen's famous bass-reliefs \"The\r\nWorkshop of Vulcan,\" \"Achilles and Priam,\" and the two well-known\r\nmedallions, \"Morning\" and \"Night,\" which were reproduced a thousand-fold\r\nthroughout Europe. They were conceived, it is said, during a sleepless\r\nnight, and were modelled in one day.\r\n\r\nDespite the urgent requests of his countrymen, Thorvaldsen would not be\r\nweaned from Rome. About this time Thorvaldsen produced his famous \"Dancing\r\nGirl,\" \"Love Victorious,\" \"Ganymede and the Eagle,\" and \"A Young Shepherd\r\nwith his Dog.\" It was then, too, that he modelled the portrait of Lord\r\nByron which served for the monument subsequently erected to that poet in\r\nthe library of Trinity College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Lion of Luzerne\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thorvaldsen in Copenhagen]\r\n\r\nAt last, after thirty-three years of absence from home, Thorvaldsen\r\nresolved to return to Denmark. On the way he stopped at Luzerne in\r\nSwitzerland, and there executed the famous Lion of Luzerne, carved into the\r\nsolid rock of the Alps. When he modelled this monument, Thorvaldsen had\r\nnever seen a live lion. From Luzerne, Thorvaldsen proceeded straight to\r\nCopenhagen. He was received like a royal sovereign. At Copenhagen the\r\nartist began his great series of sculptural embellishments for the\r\nCathedral. As completed, they comprised almost all his works on religious\r\nsubjects, among them the colossal \"Christ and the Twelve Apostles,\" the\r\ngrand frieze of \"Christ on the Road to Calvary,\" \"The Baptism of Christ,\"\r\n\"The Preachings of St. John the Baptist,\" \"Christ's Entry into Jerusalem,\"\r\nand \"The Lord's Supper.\" From Copenhagen Thorvaldsen went to Warsaw, where\r\nhe executed a bust of Emperor Alexander, and an equestrian statue of Prince\r\nPoniatovski. This monument did not reach Warsaw until 1829. It was never\r\nput up. What became of it is still a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roman honors]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thorvaldsen's friends]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sculptures for Germany]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Thorvaldsen Museum]\r\n\r\nThe accidental collapse of Thorvaldsen's studio at Rome, and the damage\r\ndone to several of his sculptures there, hastened his return to that city.\r\nOn the death of Pope Pius VII., shortly afterward, Thorvaldsen was\r\ncommissioned by Cardinal Consalvi to execute a monument to his memory. The\r\ndeath of Canova having left the Academy of St. Luke without a president,\r\nPope Leo XII. himself nominated Thorvaldsen as Canova's successor. When\r\nobjections were raised that he was a heretic, the Holy Father asked: \"Is\r\nthere any doubt that Thorvaldsen is the greatest sculptor in Rome?\" \"The\r\nfact is incontestable,\" answered the prelates. \"Then Thorvaldsen shall be\r\nmade president,\" said Leo XII. The office was held by the Danish sculptor\r\nfor the full term of three years, when he was glad to resign it. Just\r\nbefore the outbreak of the Paris Revolution of 1830, Thorvaldsen was\r\ncommissioned to execute a colossal bust of Napoleon I. He entered upon this\r\ntask with enthusiasm. During the trying times of the revolution at Rome,\r\nThorvaldsen formed a close friendship with Horace Vernet, the French\r\nartist, and Felix Mendelssohn, the German composer. Mendelssohn would play\r\non the piano in Thorvaldsen's studio at Rome, while the sculptor worked on\r\nhis models. About this time, too, occurred the famous interview between\r\nThorvaldsen and Walter Scott. Neither understood the other's language, yet\r\nthey took a warm liking to each other. Later, Thorvaldsen modelled a bust\r\nof Sir Walter Scott. Shortly after the Revolution of 1830, the new French\r\nGovernment of Louis Philippe appointed Thorvaldsen an officer of the Legion\r\nof Honor. At the invitation of King Louis of Bavaria, Thorvaldsen went to\r\nMunich. There he finished his monument to Prince Eugene, the equestrian\r\nstatue of Elector Maximilian, and another model of his famous \"Adonis,\"\r\nordered by that art-loving King. For the city of Mainz he finished his\r\nmodel of Gutenberg, for which he refused to receive any pay, while for the\r\ncity of Stuttgart he made a monument of Schiller. On Thorvaldsen's return\r\nto Rome, his stay there was brought to an end by an epidemic of cholera.\r\nThe government of Denmark sent a royal frigate to Leghorn to bring\r\nThorvaldsen and all his sculptures back to his native land. Arriving in\r\nCopenhagen, the old artist was received with even greater honor than\r\nbefore. The Castle of Nysoe was put at his disposal, and there he executed\r\nhis last works, among them a statue of himself. In his seventy-second year\r\nhe died very suddenly, while attending a performance at the Royal Theatre\r\nat Copenhagen. His obsequies were marked by all the pomp and ceremony due\r\nto a sovereign of Denmark. Four years later, after the completion of the\r\nThorvaldsen Museum, his remains were laid in the vault that had been\r\nprepared for him there, amid the rich collection of his masterpieces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The master's pupils]\r\n\r\nAs a sculptor, Thorvaldsen's name will always be linked with that of his\r\ngreat rival and contemporary, Canova. Both sculptors are equally remarkable\r\nfor the way they returned to the classic traditions of Hellenic sculpture.\r\nIt can be said of them that they bridged the chasm of nearly two thousand\r\nyears that had elapsed between antiquity and modern times. It was reserved\r\nto their successors to introduce a modern note in sculpture. Like Canova,\r\nThorvaldsen exerted great influence on almost all the sculptors who came to\r\nRome in his day. Thus Rauch declared himself indebted to him for the purity\r\nof his style. From his school in turn issued Riechel of Dresden, Drake,\r\nWolff and Blauser of Cologne. Among the friends of Thorvaldsen, who\r\nprofited by his councils, were Dannecker, Schadow and Schwanthaler. At\r\nRome, Tenerini, Louis Bienaimé, Pierre Galli and Emile Wolff proved\r\nthemselves apt pupils of the Danish master, while, at Copenhagen,\r\nThorvaldsen's influence was kept alive by Bisson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Saint Hilaire]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comte]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lacordaire]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Count of Monte Cristo\"]\r\n\r\nIn France two other great personages of Napoleonic days passed away with\r\nJoseph Bonaparte, the great Napoleon's brother and quondam king of Naples\r\nand Spain, and Jacques Lafitte, Napoleon's banker, to whose honor were\r\nintrusted the millions left behind by Napoleon, when he fled from Paris.\r\nMore lamented than their death, perhaps, was that of Etienne Geoffroy\r\nSaint-Hilaire, the great French naturalist. Born in 1772, he first came\r\ninto prominence as the curator of the wild animals in the Jardin des\r\nPlantes. Here he formed his life-long friendship with Cuvier. General\r\nBonaparte took him along on the expedition to Egypt, where Saint-Hilaire\r\nhelped found the Institute of Cairo. In 1807 he was admitted into the\r\nFrench Institute, and two years later was appointed Professor of Zoology\r\nand Comparative Physiology in the Faculty of Sciences. This chair he\r\nretained until his death. Starting as a pure zoologist, Saint-Hilaire\r\nbecame the founder of the science of philosophical anatomy. This new\r\ndoctrine was fully expounded in his \"Philosophie Anatomique\" (1818-1822).\r\nOther important works of Saint-Hilaire were \"Histoire Naturelle des\r\nMammifères,\" collaborated with Cuvier (1819-1837); \"Principes de la\r\nPhilosophie Zoologique\" (1830), and \"Etudes Progressives d'un Naturaliste.\"\r\nDuring this same year Comte published his \"Discours sur l'Esprit Positive.\"\r\nPère Lacordaire brought out his \"Funeral Orations,\" while Charles\r\nLenormais, with others, published the great French work on \"Ceramographic\r\nMonuments.\" Practical effect to the teachings of Saint-Simon, Fourier and\r\nLouis Blanc was given by the establishment of the so-called Crèches, or\r\ninfant asylums for the temporary care of children of working mothers. The\r\ngreatest literary success of the year was that of Alexandre Dumas's serial\r\nnovel, \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French war with Morocco]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hawaiian independence guaranteed]\r\n\r\nThe foreign affairs of France throughout this year were conducted by\r\nGuizot. As a result of the military occupation of Algiers, war with Morocco\r\nbroke out in May. The Prince de Joinville bombarded and captured the\r\nfortified town of Mogador. Marshal Buguead won a signal victory over the\r\nMoors on the banks of Isly. After the defeat of the rebellious subjects of\r\nthe Sultan of Morocco, this potentate, Abder Rahman, made common cause with\r\nthe French against Abd-el-Kader. A French treaty with China was negotiated\r\nby Guizot in October. In regard to the vexed problem of Tahiti and the\r\nHawaiian Islands an understanding was reached with the other Powers. Amends\r\nwere made to England for the French indignities to the British Consul at\r\nTahiti, while the independence of Hawaii was guaranteed by a joint\r\ndeclaration of France, Great Britain and the United States. Toward the\r\nclose of the year the uncertainties of government in Spain were once more\r\nmade manifest by a military insurrection, headed by General Zurbano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1845\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poe's \"Raven\"]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year, in America, came a literary sensation of\r\nunwonted brilliancy. In the New York \"Evening Mirror,\" January 29, Edgar\r\nAllan Poe's famous poem \"The Raven\" was reprinted from the advance sheets\r\nof \"The American Whig Review,\" in which the name of the author was masked\r\nunder the pseudonym of \"Quarles.\" The poem was copied all over America and\r\nsoon reached England. Baudelaire translated it into French. As Poe's\r\nbiographer, Woodberry, has said: \"No great poem ever established itself so\r\nimmediately, so widely and so imperishably in men's minds.\" A literary\r\ntradition has it that Poe only received ten dollars for this masterpiece,\r\nand had to wait a year and more for his money.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Texas annexed to the United States]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Florida admitted to Union]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: James K. Polk, President]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oregon dispute settled.]\r\n\r\nWar between the United States of North America and Mexico was now seen to\r\nbe inevitable. On January 25, a joint resolution for the annexation of\r\nTexas passed through the American House of Representatives by a vote of 120\r\nto 98, and through the Senate by 27 over 25 votes. On March 1, President\r\nTyler signed the bill. The tactics by which Texas was annexed were similar\r\nto those by which the Missouri Compromise had been forced through Congress\r\nin 1820, and the nullification compromise in 1833. It meant a distinct\r\ngain for the pro-slavery party in the United States, and was denounced as\r\nsuch by the abolitionists of the North. Both in Mexico and in the United\r\nStates active preparations were now made for war. American ships were still\r\nwelcomed in the ports of Mexico, the more so since many of them brought\r\nneeded munitions of war. In the United States strenuous efforts were made\r\nto settle all pending differences with other countries. In February, Great\r\nBritain had already accepted the forty-ninth parallel as a boundary line\r\nagreeable to the governments of both countries, and soon the Oregon\r\nboundary dispute was likewise settled by treaty. Caleb Cushing's treaty\r\nwith China was ratified by the Senate. Florida was admitted into the Union\r\non March 3, the day before Tyler ceased to be President. James K. Polk\r\nsucceeded him as the eleventh President. He had represented Tennessee in\r\nthe House for fourteen years, serving twice as Speaker. Having declined the\r\nre-election to Congress, he was chosen Governor of his State. His\r\nnomination to the Presidency had been brought about by accident.\r\nImmediately after his inauguration, Polk appointed James Buchanan as his\r\nSecretary of State. Polk in his inaugural address suggested a settlement of\r\nthe Oregon boundary dispute with England on the line of 54° 40'. The\r\nDemocratic platform of 1844 had declared: \"Fifty-four-forty, or fight.\" In\r\nother words, both Great Britain and the United States claimed the country\r\non the Columbia River. When Calhoun proposed a line of boundary along the\r\nforty-ninth degree of latitude, the British Ministry made a counter\r\nproposition, accepting the line to the summit and thence along the Columbia\r\nRiver to the Pacific. Despite much talk of war, Calhoun's successor in the\r\nend accepted the British proposition of a boundary along the line of forty\r\ndegrees, continuing to the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Andrew Jackson]\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the Whig Senators a treaty on this basis was approved by the\r\nSenate. With this question out of the way, the brunt of preparing for war\r\nnow fell upon the new administration. Troops were massed within striking\r\ndistance, and General Taylor was put in command of the American army. He\r\nproceeded to St. Joseph's Island, and from there crossed over to Corpus\r\nChristi on the mainland, near the mouth of the Neuces. At this point more\r\ntroops were concentrated to remain in winter quarters until the opening of\r\nhostilities. On June 8, Andrew Jackson died at \"The Hermitage\" in\r\nTennessee. He had lived there quietly ever since his retirement from the\r\nPresidency. One of his last acts was to write a public letter to President\r\nPolk, wherein he urged him to prompt action in the Oregon boundary matter\r\nso as to be ready for decisive measures in Texas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slave trade under ban]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Zurbano shot]\r\n\r\nThe frustration of the British attempt to keep slavery out of Texas was\r\noffset in other directions. A convention was concluded between Ecuador and\r\nGreat Britain to suppress slave trading in that region. In Cuba, likewise,\r\nGeneral Concha took measures for the total suppression of the slave trade.\r\nA law was passed making the trade a criminal offence in the Spanish West\r\nIndies. The government of Spain after much reluctance recognized the\r\nindependence of Venezuela. Affairs in Spain had taken a new turn. On\r\nJanuary 21, General Zurbano was betrayed into the hands of his enemies and\r\nwas shot. The Cortes adopted a reactionary constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Atrocities in Algiers]\r\n\r\nIn France, a Liberal majority in the Chambers, after a prolonged struggle,\r\nbrought about the expulsion of the Jesuits. In the midst of this movement,\r\nCavaignac, the great opposition journalist, expired. The French war in\r\nAlgeria by this time had degenerated into mere guerilla fighting. The chief\r\nevent of the year brought execration upon the arms of France. A tribe of\r\nKabyles had taken refuge in the caves of Dahra. Unable to dislodge them\r\nfrom there, General Pelissier gave orders to smoke them out. Some five\r\nhundred of the tribesmen, among them women, children and aged people, were\r\nsuffocated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonial expansion]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sikhs belligerent]\r\n\r\nColonial extension in other parts of the world was carried on in like\r\naggressive manner. Thus a joint expedition of France and Great Britain made\r\nan attack on Tamatave in Madagascar, but failed of success. Another joint\r\nexpedition of the two powers forced the Republic of Argentine to concede\r\nfree navigation of the La Plata River. From China concessions were wrested\r\nby which Christian missionaries were to be admitted to all of the five\r\ntreaty ports. As a consequence of these concessions a virulent hatred of\r\nthe foreigners sprang up among the common people of China. In South\r\nAfrica, Governor-General Maitland of Cape Colony earned the everlasting\r\nhatred of the Boers by sending out an armed expedition to assist the black\r\nwarriors of Griqualand against the Boers. In India, affairs at Lahore had\r\nreached a crisis. There the boy Maharajah, with his regent mother and her\r\nfavorite sirdar, Lal Singh, were at the mercy of their Sikh soldiery. To\r\nsave themselves they determined to launch their army upon the British.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Franklin's Arctic quest]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conflagration of Quebec]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irish famine]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peel's Cabinet resigns]\r\n\r\nBritish enterprise found a vent in other ways beyond colonial conquests. In\r\nthe spring of this year Sir John Franklin sailed out once more with the\r\n\"Erebus\" and \"Terror,\" in quest of the Northwest Passage. The last message\r\nfrom him was received in July. News also reached England that he had\r\nentered Lancaster Sound, but it was long after that before anything was\r\nheard concerning him. Since then more than thirty Arctic expeditions have\r\nsearched in vain for the body of Franklin. About the same time that\r\nFranklin sailed on this expedition, a great fire in Quebec destroyed 1,650\r\nhouses, rendering 12,000 people homeless. Just one month later, on June 29,\r\na second fire destroyed 1,365 houses. Two-thirds of the city was laid in\r\nashes. Another serious calamity was the Irish famine of this year, caused\r\nby the failure of the potato crop. The distress thus occasioned increased\r\nthe agitation against the corn laws. As during the preceding year, great\r\nmass meetings were held in Birmingham and Manchester. Sir Robert Peel,\r\nearly in the year, had showed his new leanings toward free trade, by the\r\nintroduction of a bill for the abolition of import duties on no less than\r\nfour hundred and thirty articles. The government's discrimination in favor\r\nof the duties on sugar provoked a long debate in Parliament. Gladstone\r\ncontinued to support his old colleagues in the government, while Cobden and\r\nBright led the opposition on the floor of the House. By the time Parliament\r\nwas prorogued in August, the Ministry had won a complete victory. The\r\nspread of the famine during the summer, when almost all harvests failed,\r\nreacted powerfully upon the government. A strong public letter from the pen\r\nof Lord Russell brought the precarious position of the government home to\r\nthe Cabinet. Sir Robert Peel admitted the necessity of an absolute repeal\r\nof the corn laws. Rather than confess such a complete change of position,\r\nPeel's Cabinet resigned. Lord Russell was summoned to form a new Cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Hood]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thomas Hood's Works]\r\n\r\nDuring this interim the practice of duelling in England, but recently\r\ncountenanced in the army by the Duke of Wellington, fell under lasting\r\ndisfavor by the fatal outcome of an army duel, in which Lieutenant Hawkes\r\nkilled Lieutenant Seaton. About the same time occurred the death of Thomas\r\nHood, the poet and humorist. Born in 1798, as a son of a bookseller, he\r\nsoon became a writer. As one of the editors of the \"London Magazine,\" he\r\nmoved among all the principal wits of the day. His first book, \"Odes and\r\nAddresses to Great People,\" was written in conjunction with J.H. Reynolds,\r\nhis brother-in-law. This was followed by \"Whims and Oddities,\" in prose\r\nand verse; \"National Tales,\" and \"The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies,\" a\r\nbook full of imaginative verse. Hood's rich sense of humor found scope in\r\nhis \"Comic Annual,\" appearing through ten successive years, and his\r\ncollection of \"Whimsicalities.\" Among his minor poems, \"The Bridge of\r\nSighs\" and \"The Song of the Shirt\" deserve special mention.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LORD TENNYSON\r\n    Painted by Frederic Sandys]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Sydney Smith]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pungent satire]\r\n\r\nSir Sydney Smith, the essayist, died shortly before this. Born in 1771, he\r\nstudied for orders and became a clergyman. At the opening of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury he entered the field of authorship with the publication of \"Six\r\nSermons Preached at Charlotte Chapel.\" Then came the famous \"Letters on the\r\nCatholics, from Peter Plymley to his Brother Abraham.\" This book\r\nestablished Sydney Smith's reputation as a satirist. For nearly twenty\r\nyears he published no more books, though a constant contributor to the\r\n\"Edinburgh Review.\" Some idea of Sydney Smith's pungent style may be\r\nderived from his famous remarks on England's taxation during the wars with\r\nNapoleon: \"The schoolboy,\" he said, \"whips his taxed top; the beardless\r\nyouth manages his taxed horse with a taxed bridle on a taxed road; and the\r\ndying Englishman, pouring his medicine which has paid seven per cent, into\r\na spoon which has paid fifteen per cent, flings himself back upon his\r\nchintz bed which has paid twenty-two per cent, and expires in the arms of\r\nan apothecary, who has paid a license of one hundred pounds for the\r\nprivilege of putting him to death. His whole property is then immediately\r\ntaxed from two to ten per cent. Large fees are demanded for burying him\r\nin the chancel; his virtues are handed down to posterity on taxed marble,\r\nand then he is gathered to his forefathers to be taxed no more.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meagre literary remains]\r\n\r\nIt was Sydney Smith, too, who asked the famous question: \"Who ever reads an\r\nAmerican book?\" In 1824 Sydney Smith broke his long silence as an author,\r\nwith the fervent pamphlet \"The Judge that Smites Contrary to the Law.\" This\r\nwas followed by a long series of open letters on clerical and political\r\nquestions of the day. Shortly before his death he brought out a collection\r\nof sermons. A posthumous work was his collection, \"Elementary Sketches of\r\nMoral Philosophy.\" Sydney Smith's case has been held up, together with that\r\nof Swift, as an example of political ingratitude. Despite all his labors\r\nfor the Whig cause, but slender recognition was given to him by his\r\npolitical friends in office. The excuse for not making him a bishop was\r\nthat his writings were generally regarded as inconsistent with clerical\r\ndecorum. Like Jeffrey, Wilson and other distinguished contributors to\r\nEnglish periodical literature at this time, he left no truly great work to\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elizabeth Fry's work]\r\n\r\nElizabeth Fry, the great English prison reformer, died on October 15. She\r\nit was that improved the condition of women prisoners at Newgate. Later her\r\ninfluence was apparent in most of the reforms introduced into the jails,\r\nhouses of correction, lunatic asylums and infirmaries of England, the\r\nabuses of which were so eloquently voiced by Dickens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peel recalled]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A premature announcement]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell's attempts to form a new Ministry proved unsuccessful,\r\nlargely because Lord Howick--who by the death of his father had become Earl\r\nGrey--refused to join the new Ministry on account of his objections to the\r\nforeign policy of Lord Palmerston. Sir Robert Peel was presently recalled.\r\nAll of his colleagues retained their posts, except Lord Stanley, superseded\r\nby Gladstone. Soon after Peel's re-entry into office, the London \"Times\"\r\nannounced that the Cabinet had decided on proposing a measure for the\r\nrepeal of the corn laws. This premature announcement was one of the most\r\nstartling journalistic achievements of the time. Notwithstanding all the\r\npublished denials it was generally believed, and was followed by a great\r\nfall in the price of corn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with Sikhs]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moodkee]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ferozeshahar]\r\n\r\nIn the mind of the Ministry, as well as of the country at large, the\r\nthreatening state of foreign affairs claimed precedence. In Autumn the Sikh\r\narmy of the Khalsa had crossed the Sutlej, to the number of 60,000\r\nwarriors, 40,000 armed followers and 150 guns. Sir John Little marched out\r\nof Ferozepore with 10,000 troops and 31 guns to offer battle, but the Sikhs\r\npreferred to surround them. Meanwhile, Sir Hugh Gough and Sir Henry\r\nHardinge, the new Governor-General, hurried toward the frontier with a\r\nlarge relieving force. On September 18, they met the army of Lal Singh at\r\nMoodkee and won a slender success. But for the flight of Lal Singh, the\r\nSikhs might have claimed the victory. The British troops now advanced on\r\nthe Sikh intrenchments, Ferozeshahar, where they effected a junction with\r\nLittle. On December 21, the British advanced in force, but encountered such\r\nstubborn resistance that the day ended in a drawn battle. Not until after\r\nsunset did Gough's battalions succeed in storming the most formidable of\r\nthe Sikh batteries. After a night of horrors the battle was resumed. The\r\nSikh soldiers, who had risen in mutiny against their own leaders, fell back\r\nand yielded their strong position. The second army of the Sikhs under Tej\r\nSingh came up too late. After a brief artillery engagement, all the Sikh\r\nforces fell back across the Sutlej River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1846\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Sobraon]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of first Sikh war]\r\n\r\nIn January, the hostile forces on both sides of the Sutlej River in India\r\nwere reinforced. The Sikhs recrossed the river, entered British territory,\r\nand hostilities were renewed. On January 27, Sir Harry Smith defeated a\r\npart of the Sikh forces at Aliwal. The Sikhs threw up intrenchments at\r\nSobraon. On February 10, the British army advanced to the attack under\r\nGough and Hardinge. The battle proved one of the hardest fought in the\r\nhistory of British India. Advancing in line, the British had two battalions\r\nmowed down by the Khalsa guns. Tej Singh broke down the bridge over the\r\nriver. After fighting all day, the British at last succeeded in driving the\r\nSikhs into the Sutlej at the point of the bayonet. The victory was dearly\r\nwon. The British losses were 2,000 men, while the Sikhs were said to have\r\nlost 8,000. This practically ended the first Sikh war. The British army\r\ncrossed the Sutlej River by means of their pontoons, and, pushing on to\r\nLahore, there dictated terms of peace. An indemnity of a million and a half\r\npounds was exacted. It was paid by Gholab Singh, the Viceroy of Cashmere\r\nand Jamu, upon British recognition of his independence of the Sikh\r\nGovernment at Lahore. The British frontier was extended from the banks of\r\nthe Sutlej to those of the Ravi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English internal affairs]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Clarkson]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disraeli]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Repeal of corn laws]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Peel's Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richard Cobden's reward]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern progress]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Astronomical discoveries]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sue's \"Wandering Jew\"]\r\n\r\nIn England, Sir Henry Hardinge's services in the Sikh war were rewarded by\r\nhis elevation to the peerage. The distress of the previous year continued,\r\nowing partly to a commercial panic brought on by overspeculation in\r\nrailways, and partly to a repeated failure of the crops. To relieve the\r\npotato famine in Ireland, Parliament voted £10,000,000 for that country. In\r\nthe midst of this general distress the twopenny omnibuses made their first\r\nappearance in London, and the first issue of the \"Daily News\" appeared in\r\nthe metropolis. Leigh Hunt brought out his stories from the Italian poets.\r\nSir Aubrey De Vere, the Irish poet, died in his thirty-ninth year. A few\r\nyears before his death he had published his \"Song of Faith\" and other\r\npoems. A posthumous publication was the poetic drama \"Mary Tudor.\" Thomas\r\nClarkson, the great anti-slavery advocate of England, died soon afterward,\r\nin his eighty-sixth year. Early during the first Parliamentary session Sir\r\nRobert Peel avowed his complete change of face in regard to the corn laws.\r\nThe rage of the protectionists was voiced by Benjamin Disraeli, then known\r\nchiefly as a writer of novels remarkable for the wild exuberance of their\r\nfancy. He denounced Peel as a political trimmer and no more of a statesman\r\n\"than a boy who steals a ride behind a carriage is a great whip.\" Peel, in\r\nspeaking for the principle of free trade, declared that England had\r\nreceived no guarantees from any foreign government that her example would\r\nbe followed. Notwithstanding their hostile tariffs, however, he showed that\r\nthe value of British exports had increased above £10,000,000 since the\r\nfirst reductions in the tariffs were made. On June 26, a bill for the total\r\nrepeal of the corn laws was at last accepted. It passed through the Commons\r\nby a majority of 98 votes, while in the House of Peers, largely through the\r\nefforts of the Duke of Wellington, a majority of 47 was attained. The wrath\r\nof the defeated protectionists found vent on the same day when another\r\nIrish oppression bill was brought before the House. Lord Bentinck, as the\r\nmouthpiece of the protectionist party, launched forth in vehement invective\r\nagainst Sir Robert Peel, \"his forty paid janizaries, and the seventy other\r\nmembers who, in supporting him, blazoned forth their own shame.\" In\r\nconclusion, Lord Bentinck called upon Parliament to \"kick the bill and the\r\nMinistry out together,\" exclaiming, \"It is time that atonement should be\r\nmade to the betrayed honor of Parliament and of England.\" After this speech\r\nthe Ministry called for a vote of confidence. It was denied by a majority\r\nof 73 votes against the government. On June 29, Sir Robert Peel announced\r\nhis resignation. In a final speech he gave all credit for the repeal of the\r\ncorn laws to Richard Cobden. A few weeks later a testimonial of £80,000 was\r\nplaced at the disposal of Richard Cobden for his eminent services in\r\npromoting the repeal of the corn laws. On July 16, Lord Russell succeeded\r\nPeel as Prime Minister. His Cabinet included the Marquis of Lansdowne,\r\nViscount Palmerston, Earl Grey, Earl Granville, Lord Auckland and\r\nGladstone. The Duke of Wellington was retained in supreme command of the\r\narmy. Unlike other heroes, he lived to see several monuments raised to his\r\nfame. Thus the grand Wellington Monument in London, made chiefly from\r\ncaptured cannon, was erected at the corner of Hyde Park. Otherwise it was a\r\nyear of bridge building in England. At Newcastle a high level bridge was\r\nerected, while at Conway and at the Menai Strait work was begun on two of\r\nthe greatest tubular bridges of England. In Germany, Schoenbein invented\r\ngun-cotton. About the time of the death of Friedrich Bessel, the great\r\nGerman astronomer, one of the greatest triumphs of abstract astronomical\r\nreasoning was achieved. In France, Leverrier had worked out the position of\r\nthe planet Neptune, finally determining it on September 23. He communicated\r\nthis to Johann Gallé at Berlin, who discovered the planet on the same\r\nnight. Adams, in England, a few months previous, had made calculations to\r\nthe same effect, and communicated with Challis, but owing to delays Challis\r\ndid not discover the planet until after Gallé. The Royal Astronomical\r\nSociety at London awarded its gold medal to each as equally deserving.\r\nWithin a few days after this discovery, on October 10, a satellite of\r\nNeptune was discovered by Laselle. Eugène Sue, moved by the popular\r\nagitation against the Jesuits, wrote his novel of the \"Wandering Jew,\"\r\nfirst published in serials.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempts to kill French king]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon escapes from Ham]\r\n\r\nAnother attempt to kill King Louis Philippe by one Lecompte in April had\r\nbeen frustrated by the Guards. On July 29, Joseph Henry risked his life in\r\nthe seventh attempt at the assassination of the King. Louis Bonaparte, the\r\nquondam king of Holland, who resigned his throne rather than submit to his\r\nbrother Napoleon's demands, died in his sixty-eighth year. His namesake,\r\nPrince Louis Napoleon, imprisoned in the fortress of Ham, succeeded in\r\nmaking a sensational escape disguised in the garb of a stone mason. Once\r\nmore he returned to his exile in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schleswig-Holstein question]\r\n\r\nOn July 8, King Christian VIII. of Denmark published an open letter in\r\nwhich he reasserted the union of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein with\r\nDenmark regardless of the differing systems of succession prevailing in\r\nthese provinces. The question of succession was so intricate that the\r\nChancelleries of Europe despaired of satisfactory solution. Inasmuch as\r\nSchleswig and Holstein had been recognized as German principalities\r\nentitled to representation in the Germanic Confederation, the German people\r\nas such objected to their absolute incorporation with Denmark. The storm\r\nraised over King Christian's letter was such as to forebode no other\r\nsettlement than by arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gioberti]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pius IX.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Papal measures]\r\n\r\nPope Gregory XVI. died at Rome in his eighty-first year. At the time of his\r\ndeath the Papal prisons were filled with conspirators and reformers, among\r\nwhom were some of his best subjects. His death gave new hope to the\r\nfollowers of Gioberti, whose political dreams depicted a new Italy,\r\nregenerated by the moral force of a reforming Papacy. Austria's candidate\r\nfor the Papacy having failed to secure the requisite number of votes in the\r\nCollege of Cardinals, Mastai Ferretti, Bishop of Imola, was elected, and on\r\nJune 17 assumed the title Pius IX. The choice of this popular prelate was\r\ntaken to be a tribute to Italian feeling. The first acts of Pio Nono\r\nconfirmed this impression. Universal amnesty was extended to political\r\nprisoners. Hundreds of Italian patriots who had been sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for life were set free. When, in addition to this, permission\r\nwas given to the citizens of Rome to enroll themselves in the new civic\r\nguard, all Rome gave itself up to popular rejoicings. The climax of\r\nnational enthusiasm was reached when the new Pope took occasion to voice a\r\nformal protest against the designs of Austria upon Ferrara.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of Cracow]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anarchy in Austrian-Poland]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cracow incorporated in Austria]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tennyson on Poland]\r\n\r\nFor the time being the Austrian Government was too preoccupied with its\r\ntroubles at home to carry its Italian policy to extremes. The Polish\r\nrefugees at Paris had long determined to strike another blow for the\r\nfreedom of their country. It was arranged that the Polish provinces in\r\nAustria and Prussia should rise and revolt, early during this year, and\r\nextend the revolution to Russian Poland. But the Prussian Government\r\ncrushed the conspiracy before a blow was struck. In Austria the attempt was\r\nmore successful. Late in February insurrection broke out in the free city\r\nof Cracow. General Collin occupied the city, but his forces proved too\r\nweak. The Polish nobles around Tarnow in Northern Galicia raised the\r\nstandard of revolt. Some 40,000 Polish insurgents marched on Cracow. A\r\nsevere reverse was inflicted upon them by the government troops. Now the\r\npeasants turned against the nobles, burning down the largest estates and\r\nplunging the country into anarchy. The landowners, face to face with the\r\nhumiliating fact that their own tenants were their bitterest foes, charged\r\nthe Austrian Government with having instigated a communistic revolt. In a\r\ncircular note to the European courts, Metternich protested that the\r\noutbreak of the Polish peasantry was purely spontaneous. A simultaneous\r\nattempt at revolution in Silesia was ruthlessly put down. Austria, Russia\r\nand Prussia now revoked the treaty of Vienna in regard to Poland. Cracow,\r\nwhich had been recognized as an independent republic, was annexed by\r\nAustria with the consent of Russia and Prussia, and against the protests of\r\nEngland, France and Sweden. New measures of repression against Polish\r\nnational aspirations were taken in Russia. The last traces of Poland were\r\nblotted from the map of nations. It was then that Tennyson wrote his famous\r\nsonnet on Poland:\r\n\r\n  \"How long, O God, shall men be ridden down,\r\n  And trampled under by the last and least\r\n  Of men? The heart of Poland hath not ceased\r\n  To quiver, tho' her sacred blood doth drown\r\n  The fields, and out of every smouldering town\r\n  Cries to Thee, lest brute Power be increased.\"\r\n\r\nIn Russia during this year Otto von Kotzebue, the great navigator and\r\nArctic explorer, died in his fifty-ninth year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil war in Portugal]\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the attempted revolution of Poland, another\r\nrevolt broke out in Portugal. On April 20, the northern provinces rose\r\nagainst the Ministry of Costa Cabral, the Duke of Tomar. After desultory\r\nfighting, the Duke of Plamella, one of the commanders of the constitutional\r\narmy, gave up the struggle. He resigned his post and was banished from the\r\ncountry. Late in the year the Marquis of Saldanha, with a force of Pedro\r\nloyalists, defeated Count Bonfinn at the Torres Vedras.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spanish princesses married]\r\n\r\nIn Spain, the long-pending diplomatic struggle over the Spanish marriages\r\nculminated, on October 10, in the wedding of Queen Isabella to her cousin,\r\nDon Francisco d'Assisi, Duke of Cadiz. Put forward by France, this prince\r\nwas physically unfit for marriage. Simultaneously with the Queen's wedding,\r\nher sister was married to the Duke of Montpensier, the son of Louis\r\nPhilippe. Thus the King of France and his Minister, Guizot, had their way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guizot's doubtful success]\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston's candidature of the Prince of Saxe-Coburg for Queen\r\nIsabella's hand was foiled. It proved a doubtful success for France. The\r\n_entente cordiale_ between France and Great Britain was broken. Guizot was\r\ncharged in the Chambers with sacrificing the most valuable foreign alliance\r\nfor the purely dynastic ambitions of the House of Orleans. Having cut loose\r\nfrom England, Guizot now endeavored through his diplomatic envoys to form a\r\nnew concert of Europe from which England should be left out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oregon treaty signed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rae's Arctic explorations]\r\n\r\nGreat Britain's diplomatic dispute with America, concerning the\r\nnorthwestern boundary, was satisfactorily settled by the Oregon treaty,\r\nsigned on June 15. Before this a peremptory demand had been put forward by\r\nthe American Congress that the joint occupation of Oregon should cease. The\r\nBritish originally claimed all the territory west of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nfrom Mexico to Alaska. For years the land was settled jointly. Now the\r\nforty-ninth degree of northern latitude was accepted as the boundary\r\nbetween British North America and the United States. The Columbia River was\r\nretained by the United States, with free navigation conceded to English\r\nships, while the seaport of Vancouver, the importance of which was not as\r\nyet recognized, fell to England. The value of this possession was soon\r\nrevealed. Agents of the British Hudson's Bay Company selected Victoria, on\r\nthe Island of Vancouver, as the most promising British port in the Pacific.\r\nDuring this same year, Dr. John Rae, by sledge journeys of more than 1,200\r\nmiles, explored the northernmost region, Boothia, wherein was determined\r\nthe northern magnetic pole.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ether in surgery]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chloroform]\r\n\r\nOn October 16, Dr. J.C. Warren of Boston, to whom Drs. Wells and Morton had\r\ncommunicated their discoveries with sulphuric ether, demonstrated the\r\npotency of the drug in a public test. A severe operation was performed at\r\nthe Boston Hospital, in the presence of some of the foremost medical men of\r\nthe city, while the patient remained unconscious. The news was heralded\r\nabroad and was received by medical men throughout the world as a new\r\nrevelation. Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, the famous physician and author,\r\nnamed the new method \"Anæsthesia.\" The credit of the new discovery was\r\nclaimed forthwith by several persons--notably by Dr. Charles T. Jackson of\r\nBoston, and Dr. Crawford W. Long of Alabama. A few months after the value\r\nof ether in surgery had come to be clearly recognized, a Scotch surgeon,\r\nSir J.V. Simpson, discovered that chloroform could be administered with\r\nanalogous effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mexican war begun]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mexican success]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American reverse at Fort Brown]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Palo Alto]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resaca de la Palma]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invasion of Mexico]\r\n\r\nIn the United States, during this period, the long-expected war with Mexico\r\nwas well under way. By a joint resolution of Congress, Texas had at last\r\nbeen admitted into the Union. General Taylor took position in Texas,\r\nopposite Matamoras on the Rio Grande, where the Mexican troops were\r\ngathering. Taylor presently moved his troops to Point St. Isabel. There a\r\nfleet of seven ships brought supplies. Leaving a part of his force there,\r\nhe marched to a point on the Rio Grande opposite Matamoras, where he built\r\nFort Brown, named after Major Brown, whom he left in command. The ground\r\nwas malarious, and many soldiers died of disease. On April 12, the Mexican\r\ngeneral, Ampudia, moved forward with a strong force to drive Taylor beyond\r\nthe Rio de la Nueces. Ampudia demanded that Taylor should withdraw within\r\ntwenty-four hours, but Taylor refused to leave what he claimed to be the\r\nsoil of the United States. Ampudia hesitated, and General Arista was\r\nappointed in his place. Learning that two vessels with supplies for the\r\nMexicans were about to enter the Rio Grande, Taylor caused the river to be\r\nblockaded, at the \"cost of war.\" Arista prepared to attack Fort Brown, and\r\ncut off communication between Taylor and his supplies. Captain Thornton's\r\ncommand, sent out to reconnoitre, was captured on April 26. Only Thornton\r\nescaped by leaping his horse over a dense hedge. On May 1, leaving Major\r\nBrown in command at the fort, Taylor made a forced march to Point Isabel.\r\nThe Mexicans promptly sent men across the river to the rear of Fort Brown,\r\nand opened fire together with the guns of Matamoras on that work. Major\r\nBrown was first among the killed. Signal guns were fired to recall Taylor.\r\nWith 2,300 men he turned back on May 6. Meanwhile, 6,000 Mexicans had\r\narrived and taken up a strong position at Palo Alto. On the 8th, Taylor\r\nassaulted the superior force confronting him. Two eighteen-pounders and two\r\nlight batteries made fearful havoc in the closed ranks of the Mexican\r\ninfantry. The prairie grass between the two armies took fire. Both lines\r\ndrew back, but soon renewed the fight. Taylor's left was met by cannonade,\r\nbut the Mexican column was overthrown and the entire force fell back to\r\nResaca de la Palma. The Americans took up their march to Fort Brown. When\r\nwithin three miles of the fort they encountered the Mexicans, strongly\r\nposted in Resaca de la Palma, a ravine three hundred feet wide bordered\r\nwith palmetto trees. Taylor deployed a portion of his force as skirmishers,\r\nand a company of dragoons overrode the first Mexican battery. The\r\nAmericans then advanced their battery to the crest. A regiment charged in\r\ncolumn, and, joined by the skirmishers, seized the enemy's artillery. After\r\nhard fighting in the chaparral, the Mexicans were put to flight. The\r\nMexicans lost one thousand men, the Americans conceded but one hundred.\r\nRefusing an armistice, Taylor crossed the river on May 18, and unfurled the\r\nStars and Stripes on Mexican territory. Another attempted stand of the\r\nMexicans resulted in worse defeat. Arista's retreat became a rout. Of 7,000\r\nmen he brought only 2,500 to Linares. The American troops occupied\r\nMatamoras, Reinosa and Camargo. The three States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila\r\nand Nuevo Leon were annexed to the territory of the Rio Grande. In the\r\ninterior of Mexico a revolution broke out. General Paredes was made\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kearney annexes New Mexico]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fremont in California]\r\n\r\nIn July, Colonel Philip Kearney, with an American force, marched unopposed\r\nfrom the Arkansas River and took possession of Santa Fé. On August 1, he\r\nannexed the State of New Mexico as a Territory of the United States. In\r\nMay, Captain John C. Fremont, in charge of an exploring expedition in the\r\nSouth, received a message from Secretary of State Buchanan and Senator\r\nBenton, whose daughter he had married, suggesting that he should remain in\r\nCalifornia. Fremont took the hint and returned to Sacramento. There he\r\nlearned that the Mexican commander was about to take the offensive. He at\r\nonce assumed command of the American forces, and on June 15 captured\r\nSonoma. Meanwhile Commodores Sloat and Stockton took possession of the\r\ncoast towns as far as Los Angeles, and, on August 13, held Monterey, the\r\ncapital of California. Fremont set up a provisional government, placing\r\nhimself at the head. In the meantime, the United States had sent a company\r\nof artillery, which took two hundred days in making the journey around the\r\nHorn. Among its members were three future heroes of the American Civil\r\nWar--Lieutenants Sherman, Halleck and Ord.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tardy declaration of war]\r\n\r\nThe news of these events did not reach Washington until after Congress had\r\ndeclared war on April 26, authorized a call for 50,000 volunteers, and made\r\nan appropriation of $10,000,000. Three hundred thousand volunteers\r\nresponded. Of these some 75,000 were enrolled with the regular army of\r\n40,000. President Polk, on May 11, sent to Congress an aggressive measure,\r\nannouncing that war existed by the act of Mexico. On May 23, Mexico made\r\nher formal declaration of war. General Taylor, with the army of occupation,\r\nwas ordered to seize and hold points on the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assault of Monterey]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hoffman's stanzas]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Long armistice]\r\n\r\nGeneral Taylor waited at Matamoras until September 19, when, having been\r\njoined by General Worth, he encamped with 6,000 men within three miles of\r\nMonterey, a strongly fortified place, ninety miles distant from Matamoras.\r\nOn the north, Monterey was protected by a strong citadel, with lunettes on\r\nthe east, and by two fortified hills on either side of the river just above\r\nthe town. Worth's division planted itself above the city on the Mexican\r\nline of retreat. Garland's brigade, advancing between the citadel and the\r\nfirst lunette, reached the city with heavy loss. After three companies had\r\nfailed to move to Garland's support, two other companies passed to the rear\r\nof the citadel and compelled the Mexicans to abandon that point. An attempt\r\non the second lunette failed with heavy loss to the Americans. The next\r\nmorning Worth endeavored to capture the fortified eminence south of the\r\nriver. The Americans advanced in the face of a plunging artillery fire. A\r\nhost of skirmishers clambered over the parapet and turned its guns on the\r\nfleeing Mexicans, and, with two supporting regiments moving along the\r\nslope, drove the Mexicans out of Fort Saldado. At daybreak the hill on the\r\nnorth side of the river was carried. These positions commanded the western\r\nhalf of the city. On the morning of the 23d, the American troops fought\r\ntheir way in, but were driven out again. Worth's men then pushed into the\r\ntown from the west, and finding the streets swept by artillery, broke into\r\nthe houses. On the next morning, September 24, Ampudia capitulated. The\r\ncapture of Monterey inspired the American poet, Charles F. Hoffman, to a\r\nsong modelled after the famous St. Crispin's Day speech in Shakespeare's\r\n\"King Henry V.\":\r\n\r\n  We were not many--we who stood\r\n    Before the iron sleet that day;\r\n  Yet many a gallant spirit would\r\n  Give half his years if he but could\r\n    Have been with us at Monterey.\r\n\r\n  Our banners on those turrets wave,\r\n    And there our evening bugles play;\r\n  Where orange-boughs above their grave\r\n  Keep green the memory of the brave\r\n    Who fought and fell at Monterey.\r\n\r\nAn armistice of eight weeks was agreed upon. The armistice was disapproved\r\nby the American Secretary of War, and, in November, General Scott was\r\nordered to take command and conduct the war on his own plans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Mexico]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, General Paredes, who favored the restoration of monarchical\r\nrule, was opposed by General Alvarez in the south. When Paredes left the\r\ncapital to go to the front, revolution broke out behind him. Don Mariano\r\nSolas, the commandant of the City of Mexico, summoned to his aid General\r\nSanta Anna. On his arrival this popular general, but recently banished from\r\nthe capital, was hailed as the saviour of his country and was invested with\r\nthe supreme military command. Paredes went into exile. Santa Anna, after\r\ninexplicable delay, raised war funds to the amount of six million dollars,\r\nand advanced toward San Luis Potosi. There the \"Napoleon of the West,\" as\r\nthey called him in Mexico, wasted more precious months.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Howe's sewing machine]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iowa becomes a State]\r\n\r\nOn the American side, too, little was done. On August 8, the Wilmot Proviso\r\nwas considered. It was a proviso to the $2,000,000 bill asked by the\r\nPresident to arrange peace with Mexico, and it declared it to be \"an\r\nexpress and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory from\r\nMexico, that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist\r\ntherein.\" August 10 the proviso came up for final passage, but John Davis\r\nof Massachusetts, in order to defeat action on the bill, held the floor\r\ntill the session expired. Congress adjourned on that day. Great agitation\r\nprevailed in the North over the defeat of this proviso. The Democrats lost\r\ntheir majority in the Twenty-ninth Congress, owing to the new tariff and\r\nthe predominance of pro-slavery issues in the war. Polk had but 110 votes\r\nagainst 118 when the new Congress met. Now the new tariff went into effect.\r\nHowe, the American inventor, secured a patent for an improvement in\r\nsewing-machines, which embodied the main features of the machine used at\r\npresent; to wit, a grooved needle provided with an eye near its point, a\r\nshuttle operating on the side of the cloth opposite the needle to form a\r\nlockstitch, and an automatic feed. On December 28, Iowa was admitted to the\r\nUnion as the twenty-ninth State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1847\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Santa Anna's advance]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Buena Vista]\r\n\r\nGeneral Winfield Scott reached the harbor of Vera Cruz in January, and\r\nassumed command of all the American forces. He took with him the best\r\nofficers and troops on the field of action, and left Taylor with only 5,200\r\nmen, most of whom were volunteers. Santa Anna, who had gathered 12,000 men\r\neager to be led against the Americans, was approaching Saltillo. Leaving\r\nMonterey on January 31, Taylor reached Saltillo on February 2, and passed\r\non to Aqua Nueva, twenty miles south of Saltillo, where he remained three\r\nweeks. Thence he fell back to a mountain gorge opposite Buena Vista. On\r\nFebruary 22, his troops and those of Santa Anna were within sight of each\r\nother. Under a flag of truce, Santa Anna demanded Taylor's surrender, which\r\nwas refused. The famous battleground, taking its name from the estate of\r\nBuena Vista, is a rugged valley from two to five miles wide, between rocky\r\nwalls a thousand feet high. The slopes on either side are cut by deep\r\nravines. Taylor placed his forces in groups on the crests of the bluffs, at\r\nthe base of the eastern mountain, and in the southern edge of the plateau.\r\nThe Mexican troops attempted to flank his position, but were driven off.\r\nThe Mexican cavalry were sent to Taylor's rear to intercept the American\r\nretreat, but they were beaten back after a fierce hand-to-hand fight, led\r\nby Taylor himself. Santa Anna made his first attack in three columns. Two\r\nof these combined and turned the American left. The third, thrown against\r\nthe American right, was forced to retreat, the Americans having formed a\r\nnew front. Again the Mexicans sought to gain Taylor's rear, but with two\r\nregiments supported by artillery and dragoons, the American commander drove\r\nthem back, firing into their heavy mass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taylor's order to Bragg]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conflicting claims of victory]\r\n\r\nAt one point in the engagement, an Indiana regiment, through a mistaken\r\norder, gave way, thereby placing the American army in peril. But the\r\nMississippians and the Kentuckians threw themselves forward; the Indiana\r\ntroops rallied, and the Mexicans were repulsed. General Taylor, standing\r\nnear Captain Bragg's battery, saw signs of wavering in the enemy's line.\r\n\"Give them a little more grape, Captain Bragg,\" he exclaimed--a command\r\nwhich was repeated all over the United States during the political campaign\r\ntwo years later. The Mexican column broke, and Taylor drove it up the slope\r\nof the eastern mountain. By means of a false flag of truce the endangered\r\nwing, however, escaped. Santa Anna, forming his whole force into one\r\ncolumn, advanced. The Americans fell back, holding only the northwest\r\ncorner of the plateau. When morning broke, the enemy had disappeared. The\r\nMexican loss was 2,000, that of the Americans 746. Henry Clay, a son of the\r\nKentucky statesman, as he lay wounded, was despatched by a Mexican\r\nvacquero. Colonel Jefferson Davis commanded with distinction a regiment of\r\nMississippi riflemen. Buena Vista was Taylor's last battle. Its fame was\r\nheralded throughout America. Both sides claimed the victory. The Mexicans\r\nchanted Te Deums. In the United States the poet Kifer sang:\r\n\r\n    From the Rio Grande's waters to the icy lakes of Maine,\r\n    Let us all exult! for we have met the enemy again.\r\n  Beneath their stern old mountains we have met them in their pride,\r\n  And rolled from Buena Vista back the battle's bloody tide;\r\n  Where the enemy came surging swift, like the Mississippi's flood,\r\n  And the reaper, Death, with strong arms swung his sickle red with blood.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Buena Vista, General Taylor returned to the United\r\nStates, his task finished. The exploit shed such lustre on his name that he\r\nwas soon regarded as the fittest candidate for the Presidency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: San Juan d'Ulloa captured]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Cerro Gordo]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American advance into Mexico]\r\n\r\nIn March, Scott's army of 12,000 landed at Vera Cruz. After four days'\r\nbombardment by land and water, the city and castle of San Juan d'Ulloa\r\nsurrendered. General Worth was left in command at Vera Cruz, and Scott\r\nstarted on his march to the City of Mexico, two hundred miles away. Santa\r\nAnna, with the flower of his army, awaited him in the strong position of\r\nCerro Gordo, fifty miles northwest. General Twiggs turned the Mexican left\r\nflank. On the following morning, April 18, the Americans attacked in three\r\ncolumns. Pellow advanced against the Mexican right, where three hills at an\r\nangle in the road were crowned with batteries. Shields' division, climbing\r\nby a pass, fell upon Santa Anna's right and rear. Twiggs and Worth,\r\nbearing to the right, covered the El Telegrafo Hill, and attacked the\r\nheight of Cerro Gordo, where Santa Anna commanded in person. Carrying this\r\nposition, they turned its guns on the retreating Mexicans. Caught between\r\nthe columns of Pellow, Twiggs and Worth, Santa Anna's forces surrendered.\r\nThe American troops thus gained the national road to the capital of Mexico.\r\nThey had made 3,000 prisoners and taken forty-three cannon, with $22,000 in\r\nsilver and immense munitions of war. They lost, at Cerro Gordo, 481 killed\r\nand wounded; the Mexican loss was 2,000. Jalapa was occupied on April 19,\r\nand on the 22d the American flag waved above the Castle of Perote, fifty\r\nmiles beyond. Puebla, containing 80,000 inhabitants, was occupied without\r\nopposition on May 15. On account of the sufferings of the men in the hot\r\nclimate, General Scott rested at Puebla for several months.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Doniphan's exploit]\r\n\r\nThe authority of the United States was established on the Pacific Coast,\r\nafter a final defeat of the Mexicans at San Gabriel. Colonel Doniphan of\r\nKearney's command, having been left in charge in New Mexico, compelled the\r\nNavajo Indians to enter into a treaty of peace, after which he set out with\r\n1,000 Missourians to join General Wool. At Bracto, a Mexican commander with\r\na superior force sent a black flag demanding his surrender. On refusal of\r\nthis summons notice was given that no quarter should be granted. The\r\nMexicans then advanced firing; the Americans lying down to escape the\r\nbullets. Cheering, the Mexicans ran forward, when suddenly Doniphan's\r\ncommand rose and fired, killing more than 200 Mexicans. The rest turned and\r\nfled. Near the capital of Chihuahua, Doniphan, after a sharp encounter,\r\ndispersed 4,000 Mexicans. The Stars and Stripes were raised above the\r\ncitadel. In May, Doniphan rejoined Wool at Saltillo. Then followed a long\r\nlull in the Mexican campaign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery controversy revived]\r\n\r\nThe question concerning the power of the American Congress to legislate on\r\nslavery again came up in connection with the bill for the establishment of\r\nthe Oregon Territorial government. In February Calhoun had introduced his\r\nnew slavery resolution, declaring the Territories to be the common property\r\nof all the States, and denying the right and power of Congress to prohibit\r\nslavery in any Territory. Thus began the agitation which led to the\r\nabrogation of the Missouri Compromise. By the terms of an amendment offered\r\nfor the extension of the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific Ocean,\r\nslavery was to be excluded from all future territory in the West. This\r\namendment was lost, but the bill passed with another, incorporating the\r\nanti-slavery clause of the ordinance of 1787. Calhoun declared that the\r\nexclusion of slavery from any Territory was a subversion of the Union, and\r\nproclaimed \"the separation of the Northern and Southern States complete.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Franklin's career]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Long overland journey]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Northwest Passage]\r\n\r\nIn British North America a new era of home rule began after the Earl of\r\nElgin took his oath as Governor-General of Canada in January. The imperial\r\ngovernment abandoned all control over the customs of Canada. The building\r\nof the first great Canadian railroad was begun on the main line of the\r\nGrand Trunk system. Discouraging reports from the extreme northern regions\r\nof America at last confirmed the impression that Sir John Franklin, with\r\nthe other members of his expedition, had perished in the Arctic regions. A\r\nromantic naval career was thus brought to a close. Born in 1786, John\r\nFranklin entered the British navy at the age of fourteen as a midshipman,\r\nand soon saw his first active service at the battle of Copenhagen in 1801.\r\nIn the following year he was taken on his first trip of exploration to\r\nAustralia by his cousin, Captain Flinders of the \"Investigator.\" In 1818 he\r\nwas a member of an expedition sent out by the British Government to attempt\r\na passage to India by crossing the Polar Sea. His bold seamanship during\r\nthis voyage brought him into such prominence that during the next year he\r\nwas appointed by the Admiralty to command an expedition to travel overland\r\nfrom Hudson's Bay to the Arctic Ocean. During the course of this expedition\r\nhe and his companions walked 5,560 miles and endured many hardships, of\r\nwhich Franklin wrote a thrilling narrative on his return to England in\r\n1822. He then married Eleanor Porden, the author of the heroic poem\r\n\"Coeur de Lion.\" In 1825 he was appointed to the command of another\r\noverland Arctic expedition. When the day of his departure arrived, his wife\r\nwas dying of consumption. Lying at the point of death as she was, she would\r\nnot let him delay his voyage, and gave him for a parting gift a silk flag\r\nto hoist when he reached the Polar Sea. On the day after Franklin left\r\nEngland she died. When he returned again he was knighted and showered with\r\nhonors by various scientific societies of England and France. After serving\r\nas Governor of Van Diemen's Land, Sir John, in 1845, was appointed an\r\nadmiral, and then another Arctic expedition to discover the Northwest\r\nPassage was organized. He sailed from Sheerness on May 26, 1845, and was\r\nlast seen by a whaler in Baffin's Bay. Many years later a record was found\r\non the northwest shore of King William's Land, announcing that Sir John\r\nFranklin died in the spring of 1847, and that the survivors of his\r\nexpedition had attempted to make their way back on the ice to the American\r\ncontinent. To Sir John Franklin belongs the honor of the first discovery of\r\nthe northwest passage leading from Lancaster Sound to Behring Strait.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: O'Connell's last speech]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of O'Connell]\r\n\r\nOn February 8, Daniel O'Connell, the great Irish Parliamentary leader, made\r\nhis last speech in the English House of Commons. The question on which he\r\nspoke was a proposed bill for the relief of famine in Ireland: \"I am\r\nafraid,\" he said, in the course of this address, \"that the English people\r\nare not sufficiently impressed with the horrors of the situation in\r\nIreland. I do not think they understand the accumulated miseries which my\r\npeople are suffering. It has been estimated that 5,000 adults and 10,000\r\nchildren have already died from famine, and that one-fourth of the whole\r\npopulation must perish unless something is done.\" Failing in health\r\nhimself, O'Connell went to Italy. At Rome, Pope Pius IX. prepared a\r\nmagnificent reception for him. Before he could reach the Eternal City,\r\nO'Connell died in his seventy-second year. Lacordaire, who but shortly\r\nbefore this had pronounced his greatest of funeral orations over the bier\r\nof General Drouot, thus spoke of O'Connell: \"Honor, glory and eternal\r\ngratitude for the man who gave to his country the boon of liberty of\r\nconscience. Where is a man in the Church since the time of Constantine who\r\nhas at one stroke enfranchised six millions of souls?\" When the body of\r\nO'Connell was buried at Glasnevin, it was followed to the grave by fifty\r\nthousand mourners, among whom Orangemen and Ribbonmen walked side by side.\r\nIn England, O'Connell's death was regarded with a feeling akin to relief.\r\nThere his persistent demands of \"justice for Ireland\" had come to be\r\nregarded with derision, bringing him the nickname of \"Big Beggarman.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Thomas Chalmers]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Vanity Fair\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Jane Eyre\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jenny Lind]\r\n\r\nAnother spirit that won religious renown in England passed away with Thomas\r\nChalmers, the great Scotch divine. As a teacher of theology at Edinburgh he\r\nwrote no less than twenty-five volumes, the most famous of which is his\r\n\"Evidences of the Christian Revelations,\" a reprint of his article on\r\n\"Christianity\" contributed to the \"Encyclopedia Britannica.\" In other\r\nrespects it was a notable year for English letters. Charles Dickens had\r\njust published his famous stories \"Dombey and Son\" and \"The Haunted Man.\"\r\nThe success of these novels was surpassed by that of Thackeray's \"Vanity\r\nFair.\" Three writers now made their appearance. Anthony Trollope brought\r\nout his \"MacDermotts of Ballycoran\"; Emily Brontë published her first\r\nnovel, \"Wuthering Heights,\" while her sister, Charlotte Brontë, at the same\r\ntime achieved an immense success with her story of \"Jane Eyre.\" These\r\nsuccesses were more than rivalled by that of Jenny Lind, the great soprano\r\nsinger, who made her first appearance in London during this season. Another\r\nevent for intellectual England was the sale at auction of Shakespeare's\r\nhouse at Stratford. It was acquired by a united committee of Shakespeare\r\nlovers for the sum of £3,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jewish disabilities reconfirmed]\r\n\r\nThe oft-mooted question of the civil disabilities of the Jews in England\r\nwas brought up again by the election of Baron Rothschild as a member of\r\nParliament for London, together with Lord John Russell. The Premier, whose\r\nname was already identified with the cause of civil and religious liberty,\r\nmade another strong effort to obtain the recognition of his colleague's\r\nclaim to his seat. He was supported in this not only by most of the Whigs\r\nin the House of Commons, but also by three such prominent men of the\r\nopposition as Lord Bentinck, Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli, himself of\r\nJewish lineage. As heretofore, this proposed reform was accepted by the\r\nCommons only to be rejected by the Lords, now installed in their new House\r\nof Peers. Otherwise, Lord Russell's Ministry followed largely in the\r\nfootsteps of their immediate predecessors. Palmerston pursued his wonted\r\nvigorous foreign policy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Don Pacifico affair]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British retaliation]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Palmerston obdurate]\r\n\r\nIt had been customary in Greek towns to celebrate Easter by burning an\r\neffigy of Judas Iscariot. This year the police of Athens were ordered to\r\nprevent this performance, and the mob, disappointed of their favorite\r\namusement, ascribed the new orders to the influence of the Jews. The house\r\nof one Don Pacifico, a Portuguese Jew of Gibraltar, happened to stand near\r\nthe spot where the Judas was annually burned. Don Pacifico was known to be\r\na Jew, and the anger of the mob was wreaked upon him accordingly. On April\r\n4, his house was sacked. Don Pacifico made a claim against the Greek\r\nGovernment for compensation. He estimated his losses, direct and indirect,\r\nat nearly £32,000. Another claim was made at the same time by another\r\nBritish subject, Finlay, the historian of Greece. The Greek Government,\r\nwhich was all but bankrupt, was dilatory in settling these claims. A\r\nBritish fleet was ordered to the Piræus. It seized all the Greek vessels\r\nbelonging to the government and to private merchants that were found within\r\nthose waters. The Greek Government appealed to France and Russia as Powers\r\njoined with England in the treaty to protect the independence of Greece.\r\nFrance and Russia both made bitter complaint of not having been consulted\r\nin the first instance by the British Government, nor was their feeling\r\nsoftened by Lord Palmerston's peremptory reply that it was all a question\r\nbetween England and Greece. It was on this occasion that Palmerston made\r\nthe famous speech harking back to the sentiment expressed in the old Roman\r\nboast \"Civis Romanus Sum.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troubles in China]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bogue forts recaptured]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Chinese protest]\r\n\r\nNext, new troubles arose with China. During the previous year riots broke\r\nout in Canton, by reason of a superstitious belief that a weather-vane on\r\ntop of the flagstaff over the American Consulate interfered with the\r\nspirits of the air. A Chinaman was shot during the riots. The British had\r\nto interfere on behalf of the threatened Americans. The outraged feelings\r\nof the Chinese populace were allayed by a conciliatory declaration of\r\nEmperor Taouk-Wang, to the effect that the Christian religion could be\r\ncommended as a faith for inculcating the principles of virtue. At the same\r\ntime he sent a special commissioner, Ke-Ying, \"amicably to regulate the\r\ncommerce with foreign merchants at Canton.\" Trouble again broke out in\r\nMarch, when a small English hunting and fishing party violated the\r\nagreement confining them to the foreign concession at Canton. They were\r\npelted with stones by the natives. Sir John Davis denounced this incident\r\nas international outrage, and, in disregard of the accepted treaty\r\nprovisions, proclaimed \"that he would exact and acquire from the Chinese\r\nGovernment that British subjects should be as free from molestation and\r\ninsult in China as they would be in England.\" On April 1, all the available\r\nforces at Hong Kong were summoned to Canton. Three steamships, bearing two\r\nregiments of soldiers, convoyed by a British man-of-war, attacked the Bogue\r\nforts. The Chinese, acting under orders from Ke-Ying, made no resistance. A\r\nBritish landing force seized the batteries and spiked the guns. Next, the\r\nforts opposite Canton were captured without a blow. Without a shot fired,\r\nCanton, on April 3, lay at the mercy of the British guns. Ke-Ying accepted\r\nthe British ultimatum that the whole city of Canton should be opened to\r\nEnglishmen two years from date. The agreement was closed with this\r\nsignificant statement on behalf of the Chinese Emperor: \"If mutual\r\ngood-will is to be maintained between the Chinese and foreigners, the\r\ncommon feelings of mankind, as well as the just principles of heaven, must\r\nbe considered and conformed with.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nicaragua coerced]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Threatened intervention in Portugal]\r\n\r\nA new phase in Great Britain's boundary dispute with Nicaragua was reached\r\nby a British squadron's abrupt seizure of the harbor of San Juan del Norte,\r\nNicaragua's only seaport on the Atlantic coast. In regard to the demands\r\nmade for the free navigation of the La Plata River, the Argentine Republic\r\nat last came to terms. The joint squadrons of England and France thereupon\r\nraised their blockade of Buenos Ayres. At London a conference of English\r\nand French statesmen, to which Spain was likewise admitted, had come to an\r\nagreement to interfere on behalf of Queen Maria II., in Portugal. When this\r\nwas made known, Bandiera, one of the chief partisans of Dom Pedro,\r\nannounced his submission. Nonetheless, Pedro's followers persevered, and on\r\nJune 26 the Junta at Oporto had to capitulate to Pedro's army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German Parliamentary essays]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schleswig-Holstein issue]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, in the meanwhile, the agitation for Parliamentary government\r\nsteadily gained ground. In Bavaria, where King Louis's open liaison with\r\nthe dancer Lola Montez had turned his subjects against him, the deputies\r\nof the Landtag exerted their power to abolish the crown lotteries by a\r\nunanimous vote. In Prussia, King Frederick William IV. at last issued his\r\nlong-promised summons for a united provincial Diet. A semblance of\r\nrepresentative government was established. It was at this time that\r\nFrederick William became Elector of Hesse-Cassel. The agitation for a\r\nrepresentative government grew. On September 12, the Liberals held a\r\nmeeting at Orthenburg. Within a month the Constitutional party met at\r\nHeppenheim, in Hesse. At length a united Prussian Parliament, called the\r\nLandtag, was convoked at Berlin. The first question to claim the attention\r\nof this Parliament was that of Schleswig-Holstein. The gauntlet recently\r\nflung down to the German population of Schleswig and Holstein, by King\r\nChristian VIII. of Denmark, was picked up not only by the anti-Danish\r\nHolsteiners, but by the whole German nation as well. Little Schleswig, with\r\nits 160 square miles and 400,000 inhabitants, was claimed by every German\r\nas German borderland. King Christian at this time was failing in health.\r\nHis condition had been aggravated by the recent great fire at Copenhagen,\r\nwhich, amid other costly properties, destroyed invaluable records of\r\nIcelandic literature, including more than 2,000 unpublished manuscripts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Mendelssohn]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Songs Without Words\"]\r\n\r\nAn event of like international importance was the death of Felix\r\nMendelssohn-Bartholdy, at the age of thirty-eight. He was the grandson of\r\nthe philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, and the son of the gifted Lea\r\nSolomon-Bartholdy, from whom he received his first piano lessons. At the\r\nage of ten he joined the Singing Academy of Berlin, where a composition of\r\nhis, the \"Nineteenth Psalm,\" was performed shortly after his entry. In 1825\r\nhis father took him to Paris to consult Cherubini, as to his future.\r\nCherubini offered to take him as a pupil, but his father preferred to bring\r\nhim up in the musical atmosphere of his own home. There the boy perfected\r\nhimself as a piano player and wrote a host of early compositions. The\r\noverture to \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" was written in 1826, when\r\nMendelssohn was but seventeen years old. Two years later his first opera,\r\n\"The Marriage of Camècho,\" was given at the Berlin Opera. In Berlin,\r\nMendelssohn became the leading figure in the propaganda for the music of\r\nBach. Having undertaken a journey to England, at the suggestion of\r\nMoscheles, he gave a series of concerts there, after which he travelled\r\nthroughout Europe. It was at this time that he wrote his \"Songs Without\r\nWords,\" and composed the overture, \"A Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage.\"\r\nAfter filling a musical directorship at Düsseldorf, he was summoned to\r\nconduct the orchestra of the Gewandhaus there. This proved an important\r\nturn in his career. In 1841, Frederick William IV. of Prussia invited him\r\nto Berlin, where he organized the famous Cathedral choir. Returning to\r\nLeipzig, he founded the musical conservatory in that city. The sudden death\r\nof his favorite sister, Fannie, gave him such a shock that he died within a\r\nfew months after her. Mendelssohn exerted little influence as an operatic\r\ncomposer, but achieved the highest rank by such vocal compositions as the\r\noratorios \"St. Paul\" and \"Elijah,\" and some of his beautiful songs, which\r\nhave become folksongs. Of his orchestral pieces, the most famous are his\r\nconcert overtures, such as that of the \"Midsummer Night's Dream,\" or \"Ruy\r\nBlas,\" and his \"Funeral March.\" The most celebrated of his piano pieces are\r\nthe popular \"Songs Without Words,\" the \"Wedding March\" and the brilliant\r\n\"Rondo Capriccioso.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Marilhat]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gautier on Marilhat]\r\n\r\nBy the death of Prosper Marilhat, a young artist of great promise was lost\r\nto France. But a few years before, Marilhat sent no less than eight\r\nmasterpieces to the Salon, but they were received so coldly that the young\r\nartist fell into a state from which death was a happy deliverance.\r\nThéophile Gautier wrote of him, \"That exhibition was Marilhat's swan song,\r\nand the works he sent were eight diamonds.\" After Marilhat's death, some of\r\nhis unfinished paintings commanded great prices. Thus his \"Entrance to\r\nJerusalem,\" at the Wertheimer sale at Paris in 1861, fetched 16,000 francs.\r\nFifteen years later, at the Oppenheim sale in Paris, Marilhat's \"Ruins Near\r\nCairo\" brought no less than 29,000 francs. It was as a painter of Oriental\r\nsubjects that Marilhat won his most lasting distinction. Having travelled\r\nto the East with Baron Hugel, he remained for many years in Egypt, painted\r\nportraits of the Khedive and decorated several of the buildings of\r\nAlexandria. In an obituary article published in the \"Revue des Deux\r\nMondes,\" Théophile Gautier wrote: \"Marilhat was a Syrian Arab. He must\r\nhave had in his veins some blood of the Saracens whom Charles Martel did\r\nnot kill.... One of the glories of Marilhat was that he preserved his\r\noriginality in presence of Decamps. The talents of these two men are\r\nparallel lines, it is true, but they do not touch each other. The more\r\nfruitful fancy of the one is balanced by the character in the works of the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Oudinot]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Grouchy]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Marie Louise]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mérimée and Dumas]\r\n\r\nIn France the dissatisfaction with Louis Philippe's government, as\r\nadministered by Guizot, was steadily increasing. The Socialist party, led\r\nby Louis Blanc, agitated the country for reform. An appeal to Revolutionary\r\ntraditions was made by the simultaneous publication of Blanc's and\r\nMichelet's histories of the French Revolution. At the same time, Lamartine\r\nbrought out his \"Histoire des Girondins.\" Napoleonic traditions were\r\nrevived by a series of events following the death of General Drouot. In\r\nSeptember came the death of Marshal Oudinot, the hero of Bitche,\r\nMoorlautern, Trêves, Ingolstadt, Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, Ostralenka,\r\nFriesland and Wagram. Oudinot was wounded innumerable times and was twice\r\nmade a prisoner. He bore a prominent part throughout the Russian campaign\r\nand that of 1814. During the Hundred Days he remained in retirement. For\r\nthis he was made Commander-in-chief of the National Guards under the\r\nRestoration, and passed through the campaign of Spain in 1823, when he\r\ncaptured Madrid. After his death, Marshal Soult, another veteran of the\r\nNapoleonic wars, succeeded him as general commander of the French army.\r\nBefore this, Marshal Grouchy had likewise expired in his eighty-first year.\r\nHe it was who was held responsible by Napoleon for the final crushing\r\ndefeat at Waterloo. There he failed to support his chief, when Blücher came\r\nto the support of Wellington. To the end of his days, Grouchy insisted that\r\nNapoleon's orders to this effect never reached him, but it was held up\r\nagainst him that some of his officers on that occasion had vainly urged him\r\nto march on the sound of the cannons at Waterloo. On October 10, Jerome\r\nBonaparte, Napoleon's brother and the quondam king of Westphalia, was\r\npermitted to return to France after an exile of thirty-two years. Late in\r\nthe year, ex-Empress Marie Louise, Napoleon's second wife, died at the age\r\nof fifty-six in Austria. Never beloved like her predecessor Josephine, she\r\nlost the esteem of all Frenchmen by her failure to stand by her husband\r\nafter his downfall and exile to St. Helena, and by her subsequent liaison\r\nwith her chamberlain, Neipperg, to whom she bore several children. Other\r\nevents of lasting interest in France, during this year, were the opening of\r\nthe great canal from Marseilles to Durano, the death of Duc de Polignac,\r\nwho helped cause the downfall of his royal master Charles X., and the\r\npublication of Mérimée's \"Carmen\" and of \"Aventures de Quatre Femmes et\r\nd'un Perroquet,\" by the younger Dumas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austrians occupy Ferrara]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italy aroused]\r\n\r\nUnder the stimulus of Pius IX.'s apparent sympathy for the cause of\r\nnational unity in Italy, as well as that of the teachings of Mazzini, the\r\nItalian patriots took heart again. One group, consisting mostly of the\r\npoliticians and military men of Piedmont, centred their hopes in the\r\ntraditional antagonism of the princes of Savoy against Austria. Charles\r\nAlbert of Carrignano, whom Metternich had attempted to exclude from the\r\nsuccession, showed marked independence in his dealings with Austria. In\r\n1847, the Italian question came uppermost again when the Austrian\r\nGovernment, on a new interpretation in one of the clauses in the treaty of\r\nVienna, occupied the town of Ferrara in the ecclesiastical states. Pius IX.\r\npromptly protested against this trespass of his territories. The King of\r\nSardinia openly announced his intention to take the field against Austria,\r\nshould war break out. English and French warships appeared at Naples. In\r\nSicily and southern Italy the attitude of the patriots grew threatening.\r\nApprehensions of a general revolution throughout Italy at length induced\r\nMetternich to agree with the neutral powers on a compromise concerning the\r\noccupation of Ferrara. Lucca was united with Tuscany. Still patriotic\r\npassion seethed in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mexican campaigns resumed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Santa Anna outflanked]\r\n\r\nIn America, after several months of comparative inaction, the war in Mexico\r\nwas renewed with vigor. On August 6, General Scott received reinforcements.\r\nLeaving a governor at Puebla, he marched on with 14,000 men. He met with no\r\nresistance at the passes of the Cordilleras. On August 10, from the top of\r\nthe Rio Frio Mountains, the City of Mexico, lying in a fertile, lake-dotted\r\nbasin, was in sight. The land around the city was under water, and the\r\ncapital was approached by causeways across the low and marshy ground. The\r\nnumerous rocky hills were all fortified. Scott passed around Lake Chalco to\r\nthe southwest, and thence moved west skirting the south shore. Santa Anna,\r\nintercepting the Americans, took up his headquarters at San Antonio, five\r\nmiles from the city. His position was flanked on the west by broken lava,\r\nand on the east by marshy ground. The ground was as bad as could well be\r\nencountered. Santa Anna sent orders to General Valencia, who held a\r\nfortified hill in front of the Americans, to spike his guns, destroy his\r\nstores and retreat, but Valencia refused. Riley, occupying a hill in his\r\nrear, took his intrenchments in reverse. He was cut off both north and\r\nsouth; 2,000 of his force were killed and wounded; a thousand with four\r\ngenerals were captured, and guns, stores and ammunition fell into the hands\r\nof the Americans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Contreras]\r\n\r\nThe divisions of Pellow and Twiggs were ordered, August 19, to storm\r\nContreras. The line between that position and Santa Anne's reserves was cut\r\nat the close of the day, and General Persifer F. Smith at sunrise the next\r\nmorning led an assault on the Mexican camp, and in less than half an hour\r\ndrove 6,000 Mexicans out of the fortification. Shortly afterward General\r\nWorth attacked Santa Anna and routed the garrison.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Churubusco]\r\n\r\nThe Americans followed to Churubusco on the road to the capital, where\r\nSanta Anna had concentrated his whole force. Here the river was protected\r\nby levees, the head of the bridge strongly fortified, and the stone convent\r\nsurrounded by a strong field-work. The attack on the bridge and the\r\nconvent was desperate. Pierce and Shields had made a detour to the main\r\nroad in the rear of Churubusco. They struck the Mexican reserves, and all\r\nthe troops on both sides were engaged. Worth and Pellow carried the bridge\r\nin time to save Pierce and Shields. The Mexican left gave way. A detachment\r\ncrossed the river and threatened the bridge from the rear. Worth threw his\r\nwhole force upon the broken line. Through ditches and over parapets they\r\nwent with a rush, and the battle was won. The Americans lost a thousand men\r\nand seventy-six officers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Santa Fé captured]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mexican reverses]\r\n\r\nGeneral Kearney had left Fort Leavenworth in the spring of 1847. To him\r\nfell the task of conquering New Mexico and California. On August 18, Santa\r\nFé was captured, and all New Mexico submitted. From Santa Fé, Kearney, with\r\n400 dragoons, set off for California. Kit Carson, whom he met on the road,\r\ninformed him that Colonel Fremont had conquered California. On learning\r\nthis Kearney sent back most of his force, and with the few remaining pushed\r\non to the coast. In the five distinct victories thus far gained over the\r\nMexican army of 80,000, scarcely 10,000 Americans had been engaged, 4,000\r\nMexicans had been killed and wounded, and 3,000 made prisoners, and\r\nthirty-seven pieces of artillery were captured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another armistice]\r\n\r\nScott again made overtures for peace. He had with him a government\r\ncommissioner, Trist, who had already made a vain effort to secure peace.\r\nScott accordingly advanced to Tecubaya within three miles of the capital,\r\nand on August 21 sent to Santa Anna a proposition for an armistice looking\r\nto negotiations for peace. The proposition was accepted, and Trist entered\r\nthe capital on the 24th, where he remained until September 5. He reported\r\nthat the American proposition had not only been rejected, but that Santa\r\nAnna had improved the armistice to strengthen the city's defences. Scott\r\ninstantly declared the armistice at an end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Molino del Rey]\r\n\r\nScott had now 8,500 men and 68 guns. He moved, September 7, upon Molino del\r\nRey (King's Mill), a group of stone buildings 500 yards long, forming the\r\nwestern side of the inclosure surrounding the rock and castle of\r\nChapultepec, and 1,100 yards from the castle, which is a mile and a half\r\nfrom the city wall. Scott's purpose was to enter the city on the south, and\r\nhe considered the castle of slight importance. He supposed that the battle\r\nof Molino would be a small affair. Worth anticipated a desperate struggle,\r\nand took up his position in the dark on the morning of the 8th. At 3 A.M.\r\nhe opened fire with his twenty-four pounders, and his storming party\r\nadvanced toward the point where the enemy's batteries had been, but their\r\nposition had been changed, and they suddenly opened fire on the flank of\r\nhis 500. After various contests, the fighting became a struggle for the\r\npossession of the Molino. A desperate and deadly fight took place. The\r\nsouthern gate gave way and the Americans passed in. The fight was renewed\r\nwith bayonet and sword, and Worth lost a large number of the flower of his\r\nforces. At last the Mexicans, all but 700, retreated to Chapultepec. On the\r\nleft the Americans were received with a murderous fire, which was long\r\ncontinued. Their whole artillery was then concentrated upon the Casa Mata\r\nand its works, which, after a desperate defence, were abandoned. Except as\r\nan outpost to Chapultepec, the position had no value. By Scott's order\r\nWorth withdrew his command, and left to the enemy the field which had been\r\nso dearly won. Of 3,500 Americans in the fight, 787 had fallen, including\r\n59 officers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chapultepec]\r\n\r\nThe Rock of Chapultepec rises 150 feet, and is crowned by the great castle.\r\nThe northern side was inaccessible; the eastern and southern sides nearly\r\nso, and the southwestern and western could be scaled. A zigzag road on the\r\nsouthern side was swept by a battery at an angle. The crest was strongly\r\nfortified; ditches and strong walls and a redoubt were constructed at\r\nvarious points. The garrison numbered 2,000, and thirteen long guns were\r\nmounted. A select party under Captain Joseph Hooker seized the Molino, and\r\nat night Pellow threw his whole force into it. Two forces made a desperate\r\nassault on the intrenchments in front, united and passed the Mexicans and\r\nmounted the western slope. A party passed around the western front, which\r\nthey scaled, and gained the parapet. Their comrades on the western side\r\nclimbed the southern slope at the same time and joined the two. The whole\r\ncastle was occupied. The Mexicans were dislodged and many prisoners were\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of City of Mexico]\r\n\r\nThe approach to the capital was difficult. It was by two roads, each along\r\na stone aqueduct. On the Belen road the Mexicans were gradually pressed\r\nback, however, and the Americans entered the first work, where they were\r\nconfronted by the citadel commanded by Santa Anna. A terrible fire rendered\r\nfurther advance impossible. On the San Cosme road the enemy was pursued to\r\na second barricade, which was carried under Lieutenant U.S. Grant and\r\nLieutenant Gire. Worth's columns pushed on. Having passed the arches, they\r\nbegan breaking their way through the walls of the houses. Howitzers were\r\nhauled to the roofs, and at last the main gate was carried. During the\r\nnight a delegation proposed a capitulation. Scott refused to grant terms.\r\nAt dawn Quitman advanced to the grand palace and occupied the Plaza, and an\r\nhour later Scott took up his headquarters there. Presently some 2,000\r\nliberated convicts and others began casting paving stones on the soldiers,\r\nand it became necessary to sweep the streets with grape and canister. By\r\nthe 15th Scott was in full possession of the City of Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of Santa Anna]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of September 14, Generals Quitman and Worth raised the\r\nAmerican flag over the national palace, and Scott soon afterward reined up\r\nat the Grand Plaza, where he removed his hat, and, raising his hand,\r\nproclaimed the conquest of Mexico. Santa Anna's men afterward treacherously\r\nattacked the hospital at Puebla, where were 2,000 Americans, sick and\r\nwounded. They bravely resisted and were presently rescued; the Mexicans\r\nbeing routed by General Lane. Santa Anna, again a fugitive, fled for safety\r\nto the shores of the Gulf.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Many reputations made]\r\n\r\nAmong the officers who distinguished themselves were many who gained a\r\nlasting reputation fifteen years later, during the American civil war; for\r\ninstance, Jefferson Davis, Grant, Lee, McClellan, Beauregard, Sherman,\r\nHill, Jackson, Hooker, Longstreet, Buell, Johnston, Lyon, Kearney,\r\nReynolds, French, Ewell and Sumner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Premonitions of trouble in France]\r\n\r\nLate in the year simultaneous risings against the Bourbon government of\r\nNaples and Sicily occurred in Calabria and at Messina. In the north a\r\nconspiracy against further government by Austria assumed the proportions of\r\na national movement. In France the popular clamor for reforms grew to\r\nthreatening proportions. Prime Minister Guizot declined to enter into any\r\nof the radical schemes for reform. In the Chambers, Guizot declared: \"The\r\nmaintenance of the union of the Conservative party, of its policy and\r\npower, will be the fixed idea of the rule of conduct in the Cabinet.\" Late\r\nin December the Chambers met but promised no reforms. Defeated in this, the\r\nopposition determined to voice its protests at a political banquet in Paris\r\nsimilar to those that had been held at Strasburg, Lille, Lyons, Rouen, and\r\nother cities. The government forbade the banquet. It was postponed until\r\nthe nest year. Popular passions for the moment were appeased by\r\nAbd-el-Kader's final surrender to General Lamorcière in Algeria, and the\r\nreported end of the troublesome war with the Arabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1848\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Palermo]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neapolitan constitution granted]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anti-Austrian riots at Milan]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Northern Italy aflame]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt at Rome]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rome bombarded]\r\n\r\nThe long seething discontent of the lower classes in Italy, fomented by the\r\nnational aspirations of such radical leaders as Mazzini and Manin, had\r\nreached its culmination by this time. The centenary of the expulsion of the\r\nAustrians from Genoa had just been celebrated with such enthusiasm\r\nthroughout central Italy that Austria was forewarned of the storm that was\r\nabout to burst. Metternich wrote to Apponyi, \"The world is very sick. The\r\ngeneral condition of Europe is dangerous.\" Communications passed between\r\nthe patriots in northern Italy and the opponents of the Bourbon government\r\nin Sicily. On January 12, the people of Palermo rose in revolt. The\r\ngovernment troops were driven from the city. Palermo was bombarded and\r\nfighting continued for a full fortnight. In the end the insurgents were\r\nvictorious, and a provisional government was established. Other towns in\r\nSicily followed suit. On January 27, revolutionary riots broke out in\r\nNaples. Threatened by revolution throughout his dominions, King Ferdinand\r\nII. of Naples and Sicily, like his grandfather, made haste to proclaim a\r\npopular constitution. A Liberal Ministry was called in on January 29. The\r\ncity of Messina was still in full insurrection when the standard of revolt\r\nwas raised in northern Italy. In order to deprive the Austrian Government\r\nof one of its chief financial supports, the patriotic societies of Italy\r\nformed a resolution to abstain from the use of tobacco, on which the\r\ngovernment had a monopoly. On the following Sunday, Austrian officers,\r\nsmoking in the streets of Milan, were attacked by the populace. The troops\r\nhad to be called to arms, and blood was shed on both sides. Similar\r\noutbreaks followed in Padua and elsewhere. Radetzky, the Austrian\r\ncommander-in-chief, proclaimed martial law. On February 15, the people rose\r\nin Tuscany, and compelled their grandduke to proclaim a constitution. In\r\nMarch the insurrectionary movement spread from Lombardy to Piedmont. The\r\nrepublic of Venice was proclaimed. The King of Sardinia declared himself in\r\nsympathy with the liberation of Venice from Austrian rule. For a while Pope\r\nPio Nono showed similar leanings. On March 15, the Nationalists of Rome\r\ndeclared against the Pope. The National Guards joined in the movement. The\r\nPapal troops had to be called out to put down the revolt by force of arms.\r\nThe hordes of Roman lazzaroni or beggars profited by the confusion to\r\ncommit hideous crimes. The Pope created a high council and Chamber of\r\nDeputies with privileges of limited legislation, the Pope retaining his\r\nfull veto power on whatever they might decree. But on April 29, after the\r\nJesuits had been expelled from Sardinia, Pio Nono turned his back on these\r\nreforms, and returned to the conservative policy of his immediate\r\npredecessors in the chair of St. Peter. His definite refusal to declare\r\nagainst Austria provoked another insurrection at Rome. This time the revolt\r\ngrew to such proportions that the city had to be subjected to bombardment\r\nby artillery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spread of the revolution]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Democratic governments spared]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile a revolution of far more serious proportions had broken\r\nout at Paris. Successful from the start, the contagion of its example had\r\nspread from France to most of the various principalities of Germany, to\r\nAustria, Bohemia and Hungary, and thence to almost every quarter in Europe.\r\nFew other events afford so striking an illustration of the modern\r\ncosmopolitan spirit that had arisen in Europe during the first half of the\r\nNineteenth Century. The great revolutions of England, of America and of\r\nFrance, in previous times, affected the rest of humanity only long after\r\ntheir occurrence. The overthrow of Charles X. in 1830 gave rise to more or\r\nless abortive revolutions in Belgium, Italy and Poland, as well as some of\r\nthe smaller German States. But the French February revolution of 1848\r\nspread instantly to all the civilized communities of the world, except\r\nSwitzerland, Great Britain, and the United States of North America. The\r\nexemption of these three countries, where alone true democratic forms of\r\ngovernment prevailed, was in itself a revelation of the general discontent\r\nof European peoples. Other explanations in plenty have been given, every\r\none of which contained its measure of truth. To Polish refugees the\r\nupheavals of this year have been in part attributed. The rise of the new\r\nnational spirit in literature was revealed in Italy and Germany as well as\r\namong the Magyars, Slavs and Greeks. The apparently epidemic character of\r\nthe movement found another explanation in the improved means of transit and\r\ncommunication, and the great development of the public press.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in Switzerland]\r\n\r\nIn the countries untouched by revolution internal progress kept pace with\r\nthe continued spread of civilization. In Switzerland, the expulsion of the\r\nJesuits resulted in the attempted secession of the seven Catholic cantons.\r\nThis was frustrated by General Dufour's prompt occupation of Freibourg and\r\nLuzerne. The so-called Sonderbund of the seceding cantons was dissolved. In\r\nplace of the former union of sovereign cantons, the Swiss republic was now\r\nreconstituted after the model of the United States of North America, as a\r\nunion of States with a central federal government at Berne. The Swiss army,\r\npostal system and finances were put under federal control and a national\r\ncoinage was established. The separate interest of the cantons found\r\nrepresentation in the Stænderat, while the Swiss people at large were\r\nrepresented in the Nationalrath, the members of which were elected from\r\ndistricts apportioned among the cantons according to equal numbers of\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: England unaffected]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insurrection in Tipperary]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Victoria in Ireland]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Orange River territory annexed to England]\r\n\r\nThe people of England, though the stirring events on the Continent were\r\nbrought home to them by so many eminent refugees seeking shelter in their\r\nland, held the issues at stake too well settled by their own great\r\nrevolution of 1649 to find a sufficient incentive for another such\r\nmovement. The popularity of the young Queen doubtless contributed its share\r\nto the stability of the government. The renewed demonstrations of the\r\nChartists in London were merely co-incident with the revolutionary\r\ndemonstrations abroad. Still the influence of contemporaneous events in\r\nEurope was strong enough to frighten Parliament into passing an act which\r\nmade the utterance of seditious speeches a felony. A popular insurrection\r\nin Tipperary, Ireland, was made the pretext for once more suspending the\r\nhabeas corpus act in Ireland. By the end of July the revolt was put down.\r\nIts leaders, John Mitchell, O'Brien and others were apprehended and tried\r\nin court for high treason. They were sentenced to death, but the Queen\r\nmitigated their sentences to transportation. A calming effect on Ireland\r\nwas produced by the personal visit of the young Queen and her royal consort\r\nto Ireland. When she held her court at Dublin in midsummer, the most\r\npoignant causes for discontent were lost sight of amid wild demonstrations\r\nof apparently universal loyalty. A constitution on home rule principles was\r\nproclaimed in West Australia. In South Africa, Sir Harry Smith, the\r\nGovernor of Cape Colony, after his successful termination of a fourth war\r\nwith the Kaffirs, proclaimed the authority of Great Britain over the Orange\r\nRiver territory. The Boer settlers there under the leadership of Pretorius\r\nfound themselves unable to maintain their independence. The adjoining lands\r\nof the Basutos were declared under British protectorate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Multan]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Punjab up in arms]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sikhs and Afghans join revolt]\r\n\r\nEarly in the year, Lord Dalhousie had relieved Lord Hardinge as\r\nGovernor-General of India. Up to that time the British occupation of the\r\nPunjab had continued without material change. Now a new fiscal system was\r\nto be introduced there to settle up the arrears of Viceroy Mulraj of\r\nMultan. In April, Vance Agnew, a British commissioner, with a military\r\nescort of three hundred men, arrived at Multan to occupy the citadel as\r\nsurety for these arrears. The British officers were admitted to the city,\r\nbut as they emerged from the citadel they were attacked, and all the\r\nEnglishmen were massacred. Mulraj called upon the Sikhs to rise against the\r\nEnglish. A force of seven thousand British troops were sent against Multan.\r\nWhen they reached the city all the native troops turned against them. The\r\nwhole of the Punjab revolted and a holy war was proclaimed against England.\r\nLord Dalhousie rose to the occasion. As he left Bengal to go to the front\r\nhe delivered a characteristic speech containing the historic declaration:\r\n\"Unwarned by precedent, uninfluenced by example, the Sikh nation have\r\ncalled for war. On my word, sirs, they shall have it with vengeance!\" The\r\nSikh garrisons of Peshawar joined in the revolt, which was quickly taken up\r\nby the Afghans. George Lawrence, the British Resident there, was carried\r\noff as a prisoner. In the fort of Attock, Captain Herbert held out for a\r\nwhile, but in the end was forced to succumb. The first general engagement\r\nbetween Lord Gough and Sagr Singh at Ramluggar, late in the year, resulted\r\nin a drawn battle. On both sides reinforcements were hurried up wherewith\r\nto wage the coming year's campaign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More Arctic expeditions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of George Stephenson]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stephenson's career]\r\n\r\nFrom England, during this time, two more expeditions had been sent out in\r\nsearch of Sir John Franklin. The first of these was commanded by Sir James\r\nRoss, the famous Antarctic explorer. The second expedition, while\r\ndiscovering no trace of Franklin, claimed that it had discovered the long\r\nsought for Northwest Passage. The science of astronomy lost one of its most\r\ndistinguished representatives in England by the death of Caroline Herschel,\r\nthe sister of the famous discoverer of Uranus. Besides her the necrology of\r\nthe year in England included the two authors, Isaac d'Israeli, the father\r\nof Lord Beaconsfield, and Captain Frederick Marryat, the romancer of the\r\nsea; Lord Alexander Ashburton, the framer of the Canadian boundary treaty\r\nthat commemorates his name, and George Stephenson, the inventor of the\r\nfirst practicable locomotive. Stephenson began life as a pit-engine boy at\r\ntwopence a day near Newcastle-on-Tyne. Having risen to the grade of\r\nengineman, he was employed in the collieries of Lord Ravensworth improving\r\nthe wagon way and railway planes under ground. In 1814 he completed a\r\nlocomotive steam-engine, which was successfully tried on the Killingworth\r\nRailway. The locomotive \"Rocket,\" constructed by Stephenson and his son\r\nRobert, which won the premium of five hundred pounds in 1829, offered by\r\nthe Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company, ushered in the greatest\r\nmechanical revolution since the invention of the steam-engine by Watt.\r\nAfter this Stephenson became a locomotive builder on a large scale and\r\nacquired enormous wealth. Another invention standing to the credit of\r\nStephenson was one of the earliest safety lamps, but a committee which\r\ninvestigated the subject accorded to Sir Humphry Davy the priority of this\r\ninvention. During this year Sir Austin Henry Layard published the results\r\nof his original researches of Nineveh and its remains. Macaulay printed the\r\nfirst two volumes of his \"History of England,\" while Matthew Arnold brought\r\nout his \"Strayed Reveller\" and other poems. Elizabeth Gaskell published\r\n\"Mary Barton.\"\r\n\r\nOf the various expeditions undertaken in search of Sir John Franklin, the\r\nmost noteworthy perhaps was Dr. John Rae's overland journey through the\r\nnorthwestern territory of America from the Mackenzie to the Copper Mine\r\nRiver. This opened up a vast tract of country to adventurous Canadians.\r\nAnother lasting benefit was conferred upon Upper Canada by the\r\nreorganization of the public school system of Ontario.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace with Mexico]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American expansion]\r\n\r\nOn the part of the United States the war with Mexico was brought to a\r\nclose. The President of the Mexican Congress assumed provisional authority,\r\nand, on February 2, that body at Guadaloupe Hidalgo concluded peace with\r\nthe United States. With slight amendments the treaty was ratified by the\r\nUnited States Senate on March 10, and by the Mexican Congress at Queratero\r\non the 30th of May. President Polk, on July 4 following, finally proclaimed\r\npeace. The Americans under the terms of the treaty evacuated Mexico within\r\nthree months, paid Mexico $3,000,000 immediately, and $12,000,000 in three\r\nannual instalments, and assumed debts of $3,500,000 due from Mexico to\r\nAmerican citizens. These payments were made in consideration of new\r\naccessions of territory which gave to the United States not only Texas, but\r\nArizona, New Mexico and California. The war had cost the United States\r\napproximately $25,000,000 and 25,000 men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gold found in California]\r\n\r\nWhile these negotiations were under way, Colonel Sutter had begun the\r\nerection of a mill at Colonna on the American branch of the Sacramento\r\nRiver. In January one Marshall, who was engaged in digging a race-way for\r\nthe mill for Colonel Sutter, found a metal which he had not seen before,\r\nand, on testing it in the fire, found that it was gold. The \"finds\" were\r\nsent to Sacramento and tested, with the result that they were declared to\r\nbe pure gold. The mint at Philadelphia also declared the metal to be gold,\r\nand the President referred to the fact in his annual message to Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influx of Gold Seekers]\r\n\r\nThen the gold seekers poured into California. They arrived in multitudes\r\nfrom all parts of America and other countries--thousands tracking across\r\nthe plains and mountains with ox-teams and on foot, and other thousands\r\ncrossing the Isthmus with scarcely less difficulty, while around the Horn a\r\nsteady procession of ships passed up the coast of South America and Mexico\r\nto the new El Dorado. In two years the population of California increased\r\n100,000, and still the hordes of gold seekers came.\r\n\r\nWisconsin, the thirtieth State, was admitted May 29. It had been one of the\r\nfirst districts to receive the visits of the fur traders and the French\r\nmissionaries, who went thither in 1639.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of John Quincy Adams]\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams was overtaken by death in the midst of his career. On\r\nFebruary 21 he entered the House and took his seat. Suddenly he fell to the\r\nfloor, stricken with apoplexy. As he was carried to the Speaker's room and\r\nwas laid on a lounge, he feebly murmured: \"This is the last of earth. I am\r\ncontent.\" He died on February 23.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His diplomatic career]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morse on Adams]\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams's long career is unique in American history. At the age\r\nof eleven he accompanied his father on a diplomatic mission to Europe, and\r\nearly acquired a knowledge of French and German. When barely fourteen he\r\nwent to St. Petersburg as private secretary to the American Minister, Dana.\r\nAt sixteen Adams served as one of the secretaries of the American\r\nPlenipotentiaries during the negotiations resulting in the treaty of peace\r\nand independence of 1783. At the age of twenty-seven he was appointed\r\nMinister to Holland by President Washington, and afterward was Minister to\r\nBerlin and Commissioner to Sweden. After serving for some years in the\r\nUnited States Senate he was sent, in 1809, as Minister to Russia, where he\r\nremained till 1815. Then he was transferred to London, where he resided\r\ntill 1817, when he became Secretary of State. His career as President of\r\nthe United States and his subsequent Congressional life was honorable in\r\nthe extreme. Yet Adams's biographer, Morse, has aptly said: \"Never did a\r\nman of pure life and just purposes have fewer friends or more enemies....\r\nIf he could ever have gathered even a small personal following, his\r\ncharacter and abilities would have insured him a brilliant and prolonged\r\nsuccess; but for a man of his calibre and influence, we see him as one of\r\nthe most lonely and desolate of the great men of history.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: James Russell Lowell]\r\n\r\nDuring this year James Russell Lowell published his \"Bigelow Papers,\" a\r\nhumorous satire on the Mexican war in Yankee dialect, the \"Indian Summer\r\nReverie,\" and \"A Fable for Critics.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Donizetti]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early operas]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prolific compositions]\r\n\r\nOn April 8, Gaetano Donizetti--who together with Rossini and Bellini formed\r\nthe brilliant triumvirate of Italian composers in the first half of the\r\nNineteenth Century--died in his native town of Bergamo. Donizetti composed\r\nhis first opera, \"Enrico di Borgogna,\" in 1819, while serving as a soldier\r\nin Venice. Three other operas followed quickly. His fourth, \"Zoraide di\r\nGranada,\" was such a success that he was exempted from further military\r\nservice in 1822. During the following six years he wrote no less than\r\ntwenty-three operas, many of which were cheap imitations of Rossini. In\r\n1880, stung by the success of Bellini, he wrote \"Anna Bolena,\" which\r\ninaugurated his second more original period, which included \"Lucrecia\r\nBorgia\" and the immensely popular \"Lucia di Lammermoor.\" The prohibition of\r\nhis opera \"Poliecto,\" while he was serving as a director of the Naples\r\nConservatory, so exasperated Donizetti that he betook himself to Paris in\r\n1838. There he brought out the \"Daughter of the Regiment\" and \"La\r\nFavorita.\" After a few years he went to Vienna, where his \"Linda di\r\nChamounix,\" sung in 1842, achieved an immense success. Having returned to\r\nItaly he was stricken with paralysis from overwork in 1845. He never\r\nrecovered. Besides more than threescore of operas, Donizetti composed seven\r\nmasses, twelve string quartets, and a host of songs, cantatas and vespers,\r\nas well as pianoforte music.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Chateaubriand]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New world inspirations]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Essay on Revolutions\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Atala\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Réné\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Genius of Christianity\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Last of the Abencerrages\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The monarchy under the Charter\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The poet's political career]\r\n\r\nAnother figure of world-wide renown was lost by the death of the French\r\npoet François René de Chateaubriand. Born at château Combourg in 1768, the\r\nscion of one of the noblest families of France, he received a careful\r\neducation at château Combourg. Roaming about on the sea-shore and in the\r\nfamous forest of Brezilien, the youth received his earliest impressions of\r\nthe grandeurs of nature. Shortly before the outbreak of the French\r\nRevolution he was sent to Paris, where he received a commission in the\r\nroyal army. It was then he published his first poem, \"L'Amour de la\r\nCampagne,\" in the Almanach des Muses. Dissatisfied with the revolutionary\r\nturn of affairs, he resigned his commission in 1790, and journeyed to North\r\nAmerica. There he travelled extensively, seeking poetic inspiration from\r\nthe wilderness and the primitive customs of the Indians. After the downfall\r\nof King Louis XVI. and the French nobility, Chateaubriand hastily returned\r\nto France and joined the army of émigrés under Prince Condé. At the siege\r\nof Thionville he was wounded and went to England. By the time\r\nChateaubriand recovered he found himself in abject poverty, and had to\r\nspend his days in bed for lack of fuel. In England, he wrote his \"Essai sur\r\nles Révolutions,\" in which he compared the recent rising in France to that\r\nof the English Commonwealth. On the fall of the Directorate he returned to\r\nFrance, and became one of the editors of Fontaine's \"Mercure de France.\" At\r\nthe opening of the Nineteenth Century he published \"Atala,\" an episode of\r\nhis epic poem \"Les Natchez,\" treating of the suicide of an Indian virgin,\r\nwho sought death rather than violate a solemn vow of chastity given to her\r\nmother. In 1802 appeared the second episode, \"Réné,\" a subjective story\r\ntreating of the hapless love of a sister for her brother, full of a French\r\nform of _maladie du monde_ akin to Goethe's _Weltschmerz_ in the \"Sorrows\r\nof Werther.\" During the same year, Chateaubriand brought out his famous\r\n\"Genius of Christianity, or the Beauties of the Christian Religion,\" which\r\nachieved an immense success. It won the approbation even of Napoleon, who\r\nappointed Chateaubriand to diplomatic posts at Rome and Vallis. The\r\nexecution of the Duc d'Enghien was so horrifying to Chateaubriand that he\r\nforthwith resigned his appointments. After extensive travels through\r\nGreece, Egypt and the Holy Land, Chateaubriand went to Spain, where he\r\nfound inspiration at the Alhambra to write \"Le dernier des Abencerrages.\"\r\nThere, too, he wrote his story of \"The Martyrs, or the Triumph of the\r\nChristian Religion,\" brought out in Paris in 1809. Less successful was his\r\ntragedy \"Moses.\" In 1810, Chateaubriand published the famous political\r\npamphlet \"La Monarchie selon la Charte,\" which was made the basis of the\r\nsubsequent royal constitution of France. On the restoration of the Bourbons\r\nhe wrote another political pamphlet, directed against Bonaparte, which sent\r\nhim into exile together with Louis XVIII. during the Hundred Days. On the\r\nreturn of Louis XVIII. he was made a member of State, a peer of France, and\r\nmember of the French Academy. In 1820 he was sent as ambassador to Berlin\r\nand then to London, from where he was recalled into the Cabinet. Crowded\r\nout of the Cabinet by Villèle, he became one of the leaders of the\r\nopposition. In 1828, he went on another diplomatic mission to Rome. The\r\nrest of his life was uneventful. Shortly before his death he brought out\r\nhis complete works, including his latest \"Etudes Historiques.\" A posthumous\r\nwork was his \"Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe,\" containing the famous comparison\r\nbetween the characters of George Washington and Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paris reform banquet]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ministry impeached]\r\n\r\nIn the French Chambers, early in February, a great debate had been held on\r\nthe Reform Bill. Guizot, the Prime Minister, held firm in his opposition to\r\nall the proposed reforms. It was now proposed to hold the reform banquet,\r\nthat had repeatedly been prohibited and postponed, on February 22. The\r\nbanquet was once more interdicted, and it was announced that any unlawful\r\nassemblage would be dispersed by force. Thereupon the banquet was\r\nabandoned. The evening papers declared that the deputies of the opposition\r\nhad agreed to abstain from the proposed manifestation. A manifesto\r\npublished by the \"Journal National\" was the cause of a noisy demonstration\r\nin the streets of the 12th Arrondissement. The National Guards were called\r\nout. On the same day fifty-two deputies of the Left laid before the\r\nChambers a bill of impeachment against the Ministry. The King and his\r\nadvisers were in a state of blind security.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Street demonstrations]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National Guard disaffected]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the eventful 22d of February, the Parisian populace\r\ncongregated by thousands near the Madeleine and the Rue Royale, shouting\r\n\"Vive la réforme; à bas les ministres!\" and singing the \"Marseillaise.\" No\r\ntroops made their appearance; but encounters occurred at several points\r\nbetween the mob and the municipal guards. Still the day passed over without\r\nserious hostilities. On the next day, the National Guards of Paris were\r\ncalled out. Their cry, as they marched through the different quarters of\r\nthe city, was \"Vive la réforme!\" This emboldened the leaders of the\r\nrevolutionists. The members of the secret societies flew to arms; and in\r\nthe skirmishes which followed between the populace and the regular troops,\r\nthe National Guard everywhere interfered in favor of the former. Thus\r\nconfronted, officers and soldiers hesitated to commit a general assault\r\nupon their fellow citizens. They allowed themselves to be reduced to\r\ninaction. The insurrection thus triumphed almost without actual strife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Guizot's Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Barricades erected]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thiers' manifesto]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The last stroke]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Philippe succumbs]\r\n\r\nThe King at length became acquainted with the true situation. In the\r\nafternoon of the 23d, Guizot tendered his resignation, which was promptly\r\naccepted, and published as an act of satisfaction on the part of the King\r\nto the demands of the people. Count Molé was charged with the formation of\r\na new Ministry. It was now generally expected that tranquillity would be at\r\nonce restored. But late at night the detachment of troops posted at the\r\nOffice of Foreign Affairs was attacked by a band of rioters. The commanding\r\nofficer ordered them to fire, and several persons in the crowd were shot\r\ndown. Their dead bodies were paraded through the city. This spectacle\r\nraised the indignation of the multitude to the highest pitch. Fresh\r\nbarricades were erected in all the most populous quarters of the city, and\r\nthe soldiers, stupefied and panic-struck, renounced all further opposition\r\nto the revolt. The King now named Marshal Bugeaud to the supreme command of\r\nthe whole military force at Paris. Molé having declined the task of\r\nconstructing a Ministry, the King summoned Thiers to the head of affairs.\r\nThis statesman, in conjunction with Odillon-Barrot, immediately issued a\r\nproclamation announcing their appointment as Ministers, and stating that\r\norders had been given to the troops to withdraw and abandon the contest.\r\nThis gave the last blow to the monarchy of Louis Philippe. Marshal Bugeaud\r\nresigned his command. The soldiers quitted their ranks, giving up arms and\r\nammunition to the insurgents. The National Guard openly joined the masses\r\nof the people and marched with them upon the Tuileries. The catastrophe was\r\nnow inevitable. Louis Philippe, feeling that all was lost, signed an act\r\nof abdication in favor of his grandson the Comte de Paris, and withdrew to\r\nSt. Cloud.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mob invades the Chamber]\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to obtain the recognition of the Duchess of Orleans as\r\nregent, and thus to preserve the throne to the heir of Louis Philippe,\r\naccording to the terms of his abdication. The Duchess went to the Chamber\r\nof Deputies, holding by the hand her sons the Comte de Paris and the Duc de\r\nChartres. They took their seats in front of the tribune. More than one\r\nmember spoke earnestly in favor of the regency. In the midst of the debate\r\nthe Chamber was invaded by a tumultuous throng of armed men. One of them\r\nwas Arnold Böcklin, the Swiss artist, who subsequently rose to highest rank\r\namong the painters of the Nineteenth Century. Marie, a violent Republican,\r\nascending the tribune, announced that the first duty of the Legislature was\r\nto appoint a strong provisional government capable of re-establishing\r\npublic confidence and order. Cremieux, Ledru-Rollin and Lamartine in turn\r\ninsisted on a new government and constitution to be sanctioned by the\r\nsovereign people. The proposition was hailed with tumultuous acclamations.\r\nThe Duchess of Orleans and her children retired precipitately.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provisional Government formed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fulsome promises]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proclamation of French Republic]\r\n\r\nThe Republicans remained masters of the field. A provisional government was\r\nforthwith nominated. It included the poet Lamartine, Ledru-Rollin,\r\nGarnier-Pagès and Arago. While the mob was searching the Hôtel de Ville\r\nthese men conferred in a small out-of-the-way chamber behind locked doors.\r\nLouis Blanc, the great socialistic writer, and one Albert, a locksmith,\r\nwere added to the provisional government. Every half hour Lamartine had to\r\nconfront some new crowd of rioters preferring fresh claims. The confusion\r\nlasted several days. Throughout this time more barricades were thrown up,\r\nuntil the government gained a breathing space by a promise to distribute\r\none million francs among the laboring men. Louis Blanc and Ledru-Rollin\r\nsigned another decree whereby they pledged the government to furnish every\r\nFrenchman with work. With the help of National Guardsmen, and an organized\r\nbody of students, Caussidière, the new police prefect, succeeded at last in\r\nkeeping the mob out of the Hôtel de Ville and the Palais Bourbon. On\r\nFebruary 27, the Republic was formally proclaimed from the Place de la\r\nBastille. The barricades were levelled and the crowds that had surged\r\nthrough the streets of Paris gradually dispersed. Throughout France the\r\nRepublic was accepted without serious opposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of royal family]\r\n\r\nFor a while it was feared that Louis Philippe's sons in Algiers, the Duke\r\nd'Aumale and Prince de Joinville, who commanded the French army and navy,\r\ndisposing of more than a hundred thousand men, might make a stroke on their\r\nfather's behalf. This hope of the Royalists was doomed to disappointment.\r\nBoth princes resigned their command, to be succeeded by General Cavignac,\r\nwho took charge of the forces in the name of the French Republic. The other\r\nmembers of the dynasty accomplished their escape from France amid many\r\ncurious adventures. After leaving Paris the party separated so as to avoid\r\nsuspicion. Louis Philippe and the Queen with a few attendants fled to\r\nHonfleur, where they lay for nearly a week in concealment. At length the\r\npacket steamer \"Express\" was placed at their disposal by the British\r\nGovernment. On March 4, Louis Philippe, having assumed the name of William\r\nSmith, landed at Newhaven in Sussex. With the Queen he proceeded to\r\nClaremont, a country-seat belonging to his son-in-law, King Leopold of\r\nBelgium. The Duke of Montpensier with the Duchess of Nemours fled to\r\nBelgium, as did the Duchess of Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English Chartists encouraged]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inflammatory speeches]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: London ready for revolution]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rioters discouraged]\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution gave quickening impulse to the Chartist movement in\r\nEngland. Feargus O'Connor had been returned at the General Election of 1847\r\nas member for Nottingham. He threw himself into a renewal of the agitation\r\nwith all the strength and vigor of a madman. A National Convention was\r\nsummoned, and it was determined that another monster petition should be\r\ncarried to the House of Commons, to be followed by a procession of half a\r\nmillion persons. The idea got abroad that a revolution might break out in\r\nLondon on the presentation of the petition. Ernest Jones had exclaimed on\r\nKensington Common, \"Never fear the vile men of the law; the police, the\r\ntroops, sympathize with you. Down with the Ministry! Dissolve the\r\nParliament! The Charter, and no surrender!\" At the National Convention,\r\nVernon declared: \"If a few hundreds do fall on each side, they will only be\r\nthe casualties in a mighty movement.\" On April 10 a great demonstration\r\nwas to be held on Kensington Common. In anticipation, special constables to\r\nthe number of 170,000 were sworn in to keep the peace; troops were\r\nquartered in the houses of the main thoroughfares; two thousand stands of\r\narms were supplied to the officials of the General Post-Office; the Custom\r\nHouse, Bank, Exchange, and other public buildings were similarly equipped;\r\nthe Admiralty was garrisoned by a body of marines, and the Tower guns were\r\nmounted. On the eventful morning, London assumed a military guise such as\r\nit had never worn before. Traffic was suspended along the streets for fear\r\nthat the vehicles should be employed, as in France, in the construction of\r\nbarricades. Finally a proclamation was issued warning people against\r\ncollecting for disorderly purposes. The military arrangements were in the\r\nhands of the Duke of Wellington. Owing to these thorough precautions the\r\nthreatened mass meeting collapsed. The procession was never held. The whole\r\naffair was covered with ridicule. The \"monster petition\" was found to\r\ncontain not six million signatures as was alleged, but only 1,975,469, and\r\nmany of these proved to be fictitious, whole sheets being found to be in\r\nthe same handwriting, and containing such names as Victoria Rex, Prince\r\nAlbert, Punch, and so forth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Collapse of Chartism]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Feargus O'Connor]\r\n\r\nIn the words of a contemporary, \"Chartism had received its death-blow.\r\nO'Brien, Vincent, and others endeavored to revive it, but in vain. Its\r\nmembers fell off in disappointment and allied themselves with reformers of\r\ngreater moderation, and Feargus O'Connor, who for ten years had madly\r\nspent his force and energy in carrying forward the movement, gave it up in\r\ndespair. Everything he had touched had proved a failure. From being an\r\nobject of terror, Chartism had become an object of ridicule. O'Connor took\r\nthe matter so much to heart that he soon became an inmate of a lunatic\r\nasylum, and never recovered his reason.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress of Italian Revolution]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austrians driven northward]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Radetzky seeks refuge]\r\n\r\nAll Italy now, from the southern shores of Sicily to the Alps, was in a\r\nblaze of insurrection. Venice, Piedmont and Lombardy were in arms. Charles\r\nAlbert, the King of Sardinia, put himself at the head of the movement in\r\nnorthern Italy. From all parts of Italy volunteers crowded to his banners.\r\nIn defiance of the Pope's orders a compact body of these volunteers marched\r\nfrom Rome. Radetzky, the Austrian commander, a veteran of all the Austrian\r\nwars since the outbreak of the French Revolution, had long prepared for\r\nthis struggle by formidable fortifications at Verona. When Milan revolted\r\nand the Austrian Vice-Governor, O'Donnell, was captured, Radetzky evacuated\r\nthe city at the approach of Charles Albert's army from Piedmont. His\r\noutlying garrison was cut off by the Italians. Preferring the loss of Milan\r\nto a possible annihilation of the army, Radetzky fell back upon Verona. On\r\nthe banks of the Adige, about twenty-five miles east of the Mincio, he\r\nrapidly concentrated all available forces, while the Italians threw up\r\nintrenchments on the Mincio. There, with the armies of Piedmont and\r\nLombardy in front of him and the revolutionary forces of Venice behind him,\r\nRadetzky stubbornly held his ground. Nothing remained to Austria on\r\nItalian ground but Verona and the neighboring fortresses on the Adige and\r\nMincio.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kossuth's appeal]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Magyar Constitution proclaimed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stocks fall in Vienna]\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Empire itself, by this time, was shaken to its foundations.\r\nWhen the news of the February Revolution in Paris reached Austria the\r\nMagyar Diet was in session in Hungary. The success of the revolutionists in\r\nFrance inflamed the Liberal leaders in Hungary. Casting aside all reserve,\r\nKossuth declared in the Diet: \"From the charnel house of the Viennese\r\nsystem a poison-laden atmosphere steals over us. It would paralyze our\r\nnerves and pin us down when we might soar. The future of Hungary can never\r\nbe secured while Austria maintains a system of government in direct\r\nantagonism to every constitutional principle. Our task is to found a\r\nhappier future on the brotherhood of all the races in Austria. For a union\r\nenforced by bayonets and police spies let us substitute the enduring bond\r\nof a free constitution!\" On March 3, the Hungarian Lower House triumphantly\r\npassed a resolution to that effect. The cry for a liberal constitution was\r\ninstantly taken up in the other dominions of Austria. It so happened that\r\nthe Provincial Estates of Lower Austria were to meet about this time. It\r\nwas planned that an address embodying demands similar to those of Hungary\r\nshould be forwarded to the Emperor by this assembly. The political\r\nagitation in Vienna became feverish. The students indulged in noisy\r\ndemonstrations. Rumors of the impending repudiation of the paper currency\r\nand of State bankruptcy made matters worse. A sharp decline in stocks\r\nshowed Metternich that a public catastrophe was near at hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Viennese Diet stormed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fighting in the street]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Imperial palace invaded]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Downfall of Metternich]\r\n\r\nOn March 13, the Provincial Diet met. Dense crowds surged about the Diet\r\nHall. The students marched around in procession. Street orators harangued\r\nthe crowds. The tumult was at its height when a slip of paper was let down\r\nfrom one of the windows of the hall, stating that the Diet was inclining to\r\nhalf measures. An announcement to this effect was received with a roar of\r\nfury. The mob overran the guards and burst into the Diet Hall. All debate\r\nwas stopped, and the leading members of the Estates were forced to head a\r\ndeputation to the Emperor's palace to exact a hearing. All the approaches\r\nto the palace were choked with people. Street fighting had already begun.\r\nDetachments of soldiers were hurried to the palace and to the Diet Hall.\r\nFrom the roof and windows of the Diet Hall missiles were hurled upon the\r\nsoldiery. The interior of the Hall was demolished. The soldiers now fired a\r\nvolley and cleared the Hall with their bayonets. Blood flowed freely and\r\nmany were killed. The sound of the shots was received by the crowds around\r\nthe palace with howls of rage. The whole city was in an uproar. Barricades\r\nwere thrown up and the gunsmith shops were sacked. At the palace, where the\r\nEmperor himself remained invisible, Metternich and his assembled Council\r\nreceived the deputation in state. The Council urged the aged Prime Minister\r\nto grant the demanded concession. At length he withdrew into an adjoining\r\nchamber to draft an order annulling the censorship of the press. While he\r\nwas thus engaged the cry was raised, \"Down with Metternich!\" The deputies\r\nin the Council Chamber peremptorily demanded his dismissal. When the old\r\nstatesman returned he found himself abandoned even by his colleagues.\r\nMetternich realized that the end had come. He made a brief farewell speech,\r\nmarked by all the dignity and self-possession of his greatest days, and\r\nleft the Council Chamber to announce his resignation to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quiet restored]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hungarian demands]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kossuth in Vienna]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demonstrations of enthusiasm]\r\n\r\nThe news of Metternich's downfall was received with deafening cheers. His\r\npersonality was so closely identified with all that was most hateful in\r\nAustrian politics that the mere announcement of his resignation sufficed to\r\nquell the popular tumult. On the night of March 14, Metternich contrived to\r\nescape from Vienna unobserved, and fled across the frontier. On the same\r\nday a National Guard was established in Vienna, and was supplied with arms\r\ntaken from the government arsenal. The Viennese outbreak gave irresistible\r\nforce to the national movement in Hungary. Now the Chamber of Magnates,\r\nwhich had hitherto opposed the demands of the Lower House, adopted the same\r\nby a unanimous vote. On March 15, a deputation was despatched to Vienna to\r\ndemand from the Emperor not only a liberal constitution, but a separate\r\nMinistry, absolute freedom of the press, trial by jury, equality of\r\nreligion, and a free public-school system. The Hungarians, with Kossuth in\r\nthe lead, were received in triumph in Vienna. They paraded through the\r\nstreets, and were greeted by Emperor Ferdinand in person. He consented to\r\neverything and issued an imperial rescript, promising a liberal\r\nconstitution to the rest of Austria as well. The light-hearted Viennese\r\nindulged in indescribable jubilations. On March 18, the Emperor drove\r\nthrough the city. Somebody put a revolutionary banner into his hands. The\r\nblack, red and gold ensign of united Germany was hoisted over the tower of\r\nSt. Stephen. In an intoxication of joy the people took the horses from the\r\nimperial carriage and drew it triumphantly through the streets. The regular\r\ntroops around the imperial palace were superseded by the new National\r\nGuards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Germany in a ferment]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussian Assembly convoked]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King of Prussia cowed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt in Berlin]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prince William's part]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King of Prussia submissive]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal promises]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rising of Schleswig-Holstein]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reverse at Bau]\r\n\r\nBy this time the same storm of revolution was sweeping over Germany.\r\nPopular demonstrations occurred at Mannheim, Cassel, Breslau, Koenigsberg\r\nand along the Rhine region in Cologne, Düsseldorf and Aix-la-Chapelle. A\r\npopular convention at Heidelberg, on March 5, had resolved upon a national\r\nassembly to be held at Frankfort-on-the-Main by the end of March. Elections\r\nfor this assembly were being held throughout Germany. The long-desired\r\nunion of Germany was at last to be accomplished. On March 14, King\r\nFrederick William of Prussia convoked the Prussian Assembly for April 27,\r\nto deliberate upon Prussia's part in the proposed German union. Then came\r\nthe news of the events in Vienna. Crowds gathered in the streets excitedly\r\ndiscussing the events of the day. Attempts on the part of the police to\r\ndisperse them led to threatening encounters. Under the stress of alarming\r\nbulletins from Vienna, the King issued a rescript on March 18, in which he\r\nnot only convoked the Prussian Assembly for the earlier date of April 2,\r\nbut himself proposed such reforms as constitutional government, liberty of\r\nspeech, liberty of the press, and the reconstitution of the Germanic\r\nFederation as a national union of states--a realization in brief of all the\r\nmost ardent ideals of the German Liberals. Now the popular agitators\r\nproposed a monster demonstration to thank the King for his concessions.\r\nShortly after noon, on March 18, the processions converged upon the palace.\r\nImmense crowds filled the streets. The appearance of the King upon the\r\nbalcony was greeted with cheers. King Frederick William tried to speak but\r\ncould not make himself heard. The troops set out to clear the palace\r\ngrounds. Angry shouts arose for the withdrawal of the soldiery. In the\r\nconfusion two shots were fired. A panic ensued: \"We are betrayed,\" cried\r\nthe leaders, and called the people to arms. The troops of the garrison\r\ncharged into the rioters. Barricades were thrown up, and here and there\r\nchurch bells rang the tocsin. From three in the afternoon until early the\r\nnext morning, fighting continued in the streets. The entire garrison of\r\nBerlin was called out and with the help of the bright moonlight succeeded\r\nin clearing one street after another. Prince William, the future German\r\nEmperor, gained unenviable notoriety by his zeal. At two in the morning\r\nthe King gave orders to stop firing. He issued a proclamation: \"To my dear\r\npeople of Berlin,\" the mild tone of which only betrayed his weakness. On\r\nthe following day all the troops were withdrawn and ordered out of the\r\ncity. Prince William likewise left Berlin in deep chagrin and departed for\r\nEngland. His palace had to be protected from the fury of the people by\r\nplacards pronouncing it the property of the nation. Once more the rioters\r\nappeared before the royal palace with the bodies of some of their slain.\r\nThe King convoked a new Ministry and consented to substitute armed citizens\r\nand students for his royal guards. A general amnesty was proclaimed. On\r\nMarch 21, the King agreed to adopt \"the sacred colors of the German Empire\"\r\nfor those of Prussia. After the manner of the weak Emperor of Austria, he\r\nrode through the streets of Berlin wearing a tricolor sash. Not satisfied\r\nwith this, the revolutionists, on March 22, paraded before the palace with\r\nthe open biers of 187 men that had been killed during the riots. Standing\r\non his balcony with bared head, King Frederick William reviewed the ghastly\r\nprocession. In a manifesto published at the close of the day he declared:\r\n\"Germany is in ferment within and exposed from without to danger from more\r\nthan one side. Deliverance from this danger can come only from the most\r\nintimate union of the German princes and people under a single leadership.\r\nI take this leadership upon me for the hour of peril. I have to-day assumed\r\nthe old German colors, and placed myself and my people under the venerable\r\nbanner of the German Empire. Prussia is henceforth merged into Germany.\"\r\nThus Frederick William, by word and acts, which he afterward described as a\r\ncomedy, directly encouraged the imperial aspirations of liberal Germany.\r\nThe passage of his address in which he spoke of external dangers\r\nthreatening Germany came true sooner than was expected. King Christian\r\nVIII. of Denmark had died early in the year. The fear of revolution at\r\nCopenhagen drove his son Frederick VII., the last of the Oldenburg line, to\r\nprick the war bubble blown by his father. On March 22, he called the\r\nleaders of the Eider-Dane party--the party which regarded the Eider as the\r\nboundary of the Danish dominions, thus converting Schleswig into a Danish\r\nprovince--to take the reins of government. The people of Schleswig and\r\nHolstein protested. The King was checkmated at Kiel by the appointment of a\r\nprovisional government. The troops joined the people, and the insurrection\r\nspread over the whole province. The struggle then began. Volunteers from\r\nall parts of Germany rushed to the northern frontier. The German Bundestag\r\nadmitted a representative of the threatened Duchies, and intrusted Prussia\r\nwith their defence. An attempt was made to organize a German fleet. General\r\nWrangel was placed in command of the Prussian forces despatched toward\r\nDenmark. Before he could arrive, the untrained volunteer army of\r\nSchleswig-Holsteiners suffered defeat at Bau. A corps of students from the\r\nUniversity of Kiel was all but annihilated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia stems revolution]\r\n\r\nAn attempted rising of the Poles, in the Prussian province of Posen and at\r\nCracow, was quickly suppressed. As soon as the news of the revolution in\r\nParis reached Russia, the absolute ruler of that vast empire mobilized his\r\narmies, \"so that, if circumstances should demand it, the tide of Anarchy\r\ncould be dammed.\" After the abortive revolt at Cracow, Czar Nicholas issued\r\nan imperial manifesto, closing with a quotation from Isaiah: \"Listen, ye\r\nheathen, and submit, for with us is God.\" When the spirit of revolt spread\r\nto Moldavia and Wallachia, Emperor Nicholas without further ado despatched\r\na Russian army corps across the Pruth. The Sultan of Turkey was prevailed\r\nupon to do the same. Russian and Turkish troops occupied Jassy and\r\nBucharest during the summer.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OPENING OF THE OPERA\r\n    Painted by Edouard Detaille\r\n    Copyright by M. Knoedler & Co.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frankfort Vor-Parlament]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolution in Baden]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Gagern shot]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of rebels]\r\n\r\nThe German preliminary Parliament of five hundred delegates had met at\r\nFrankfort in April. It lasted but five days. The Republicans found\r\nthemselves outnumbered, when they submitted their scheme for a national\r\nconstitution. Repulsed in this, the Liberals proposed that they should\r\ncontinue in session until the real National Parliament should meet, thus\r\nextending their function beyond the limits of a mere constituent assembly.\r\nOutvoted in this, the leaders of the extreme Republicans resorted to armed\r\nrevolt. Assisted by Polish refugees and men from France, they raised the\r\nred flag in Baden. Friedrich Hecker, a popular orator and representative of\r\nBaden, headed the movement. George Herwegh, the poet, took charge of the\r\nrefugees from Switzerland and a group of German operatives recently\r\nreturned from France. A provisional government was declared in the lake\r\ndistrict of Baden. The Parliamentary majority of Frankfort, on breaking up,\r\nleft behind a committee of fifty to prepare the draft of a constitution.\r\nThe Bundestag meeting at the same time called for military measures against\r\nthe insurgents. From three sides troops advanced into Baden. A Bavarian\r\ndetachment marched from Lindau, Swabian troops came from the Black Forest,\r\nwhile from the north Hessian forces were led by General von Gagern, a\r\nbrother of the new Prime Minister of Hesse. On April 19, Von Gagern\r\nencountered the revolutionists under Hecker at Kandern. While haranguing\r\nthe insurgents, he was shot from his horse. The troops charged the\r\ninsurgents with the bayonet and dispersed them in less than an hour. Four\r\ndays later the revolutionary intrenchments at Freiburg were stormed. On the\r\n27th, Herwegh's corps of 1,000 refugees was dispersed by General Miller.\r\nHecker fled to America. The other leaders likewise made good their escape.\r\nOn April 29 they issued a manifesto at Strasburg: \"An overwhelming number\r\nof imported bestial mercenaries have crushed Republican aspirations in\r\nBaden, and have once more subjected the people to the hateful tyranny of\r\nprinces.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The cause of Italy]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Powers hostile]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italy isolated]\r\n\r\nThe unexpected outbreak of revolution in Vienna and Hungary had inspired\r\nthe Italians to rebel against Austrian rule with new confidence. On March\r\n30, Pio Nono at Rome issued a proclamation to the people of Italy, in which\r\nhe said: \"The events which have followed one another with such astounding\r\nrapidity during the last two months are not the work of man. Woe to him\r\nwho, in this storm that shatters cedars as well as oaks, hears not the\r\nvoice of the Lord.\" Under the command of General Durando, a band of\r\nCrociati, or crusaders, marched from Rome against the Austrians. Count\r\nBalbo was placed in command of the Piedmontese army. To the remonstrances\r\nof the British Ambassador at Turin, King Charles Albert replied that he\r\nmust either march against Austria or lose his crown. England, indeed, was\r\nemphatic in its disapproval of the Italian national movement. In the pages\r\nof the \"Edinburgh Review,\" Sir Archibald Allison, the court historian,\r\nwrote: \"It is utterly repugnant to the first principles of English policy,\r\nand to every page in English history, to lend encouragement to the\r\nseparation of nationalities from other empires.\" The new republican\r\ngovernment in France, on its part, had no desire to see a strong Italian\r\nnational State spring up on its southern frontier. Lamartine, the French\r\nForeign Minister, declined Charles Albert's request to sanction his\r\nmilitary occupation of Lombardy. A strong French army of observation was\r\nconcentrated on the Italian frontier in the Alps. Germany, which in later\r\nyears was destined to become the strongest ally of Italy, was still so\r\nbound up with Austria that when Arnold Ruge in the Frankfort Parliament\r\ndared to express a wish for the victory of Italian arms against Austria, a\r\ngreat storm of indignation broke out in Germany. As a last resort, Charles\r\nAlbert, on April 6, proposed an offensive and defensive alliance to\r\nSwitzerland, but the little republic wisely declined to emerge from its\r\ntraditional neutrality. It was then that the Italians raised the defiant\r\ncry: \"Italia fara de se\" (Italy will fight her own battles). When the hard\r\nbeset Austrian Government, in a confidential communication of Minister\r\nWessendberg to Count Casati, showed itself inclined to yield Lombardy upon\r\npayment of Lombardy's share in the Austrian national debt, the proposition\r\nwas curtly declined.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Set-back at Naples]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neapolitan forces recalled]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pio Nono's allocution]\r\n\r\nIt was a fatal move. The course of Italy, as Dante once sang, seemed like\r\nthat of \"a ship without stars in a wild storm.\" Affairs took a wrong turn\r\nin Naples. There a new popular Parliament had just been elected, which was\r\nabout to meet, when there were some final difficulties between the King and\r\nhis Liberal Ministers over the exact wording of the oath of allegiance. The\r\nexcitable Neapolitan populace forthwith became unmanageable. The Swiss\r\nGuards, who had long been the butt of the people, put down the revolt\r\nwithout mercy. Once more King Ferdinand was master. He hastened to dismiss\r\nhis Cabinet and dissolved the Parliament before it could come to order.\r\nOrders were sent to General Pepe, who had marched to the front in northern\r\nItaly with 14,000 men, to return at once. General Pepe, who had already\r\nreached Bologna and had entered hostilities under Charles Albert's command,\r\ndeclined to obey the orders of his sovereign. His rank and file trooped\r\nback to Naples. Only fifteen hundred Neapolitan volunteers remained with\r\nPepe at the front. A number of the officers who returned felt their\r\ndisgrace so keenly that they committed suicide. The Neapolitan fleet, which\r\nhad already succeeded in raising the Austrian blockade of Venice, was\r\nlikewise ordered home. A more serious blow to the cause of Italy was Pio\r\nNono's apparent change of front. On April 29, without previous consultation\r\nwith his new Ministry, the Pope issued the famous \"Allocution,\" in which he\r\ndeclared that he had despatched his troops northward only for the defence\r\nof the Papal dominions, and that it was far from his intentions to join\r\nwith the other Italian princes and peoples in the war against Austria. The\r\nPapal Ministry immediately handed in its resignation. The Municipal Council\r\nof Rome called upon the Pope to abstain from interference with his army.\r\nGeneral Durando, commanding the Papal troops at the front, had already\r\nyielded to their entreaties by crossing the Po. Now he threw in his lot\r\nwith Charles Albert. Pio Nono sent a confidential messenger to Naples to\r\narrange for an asylum there, in case the people should turn against him at\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Garibaldi]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Goito]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cortatone]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surrender of Peschiera]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Radetzky firm]\r\n\r\nCharles Albert on the Mincio lost three precious weeks. His army now\r\nnumbered nearly one hundred thousand men, only sixty thousand of whom were\r\ntrained soldiers. About this time he was joined by Giuseppe Garibaldi, who\r\nhad just returned from the revolutionary battlefields of South America,\r\nwhither he had been driven an exile from Charles Albert's own dominions. He\r\nwas received with honor, and was put in charge of a volunteer corps which\r\nhe had raised at Milan. The Austrian commander profited by the delay of his\r\nopponents to place his army between the strong fortresses of Verona,\r\nMantua, Legnano and Peschiera, and to draw reinforcements from the Tyrol,\r\nuntil the situation in Austria itself became so threatening that no further\r\naid could be given him. In truth, the fate of the Austrian empire now\r\nrested on the aged shoulders of Radetzky. On April 8, the Sardinian army,\r\nin a sharp engagement at Goito, effected the passage of the Mincio. The\r\nAustrians lost one thousand men. Siege was now laid to Peschiera. A Tuscan\r\ndivision moved on Mantua, while the bulk of Charles Albert's army cut off\r\nVerona from the roads to the Tyrol. Radetzky was driven to take the\r\noffensive. In a fight at Cortatone he defeated the Tuscans, but within\r\ntwenty-four hours the Austrian garrison of Peschiera was brought to the\r\npoint of capitulation. The Italians took two thousand one hundred and fifty\r\nmen. On May 6, Charles Albert made an attempt to drive the Austrians out of\r\ntheir positions in front of Verona. Repulsed at Santa Lucia, he was forced\r\nto fall back on the Mincio. Under the influence of the peace party, the\r\nAustrian Emperor now directed Radetzky to offer an armistice to the\r\nItalians. Simultaneously with this, Austrian reinforcements cut their way\r\nthrough to Verona. Radetzky sent Prince Felix Schwarzenberg to Innsbruck to\r\nimplore the Emperor for permission to continue the combat. This was\r\nreluctantly given. Fearing another reversal of his orders, Radetzky\r\nforthwith threw his army into Venetia. General Durando and his Papal army\r\nwere shut up in Vicenza, and compelled to capitulate. The capture of\r\nVicenza was followed by that of all the Venetian mainland east of the\r\nAdige.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Custozza]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Milan]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Truce of Vigevano]\r\n\r\nThe republic of St. Mark sought shelter under the royal Ægis of Piedmont.\r\nManin, the liberator of Venice, resigned his presidency and went into\r\nretirement. Charles Albert now moved on Mantua, leaving half his army at\r\nPeschiera and further north. Radetzky instantly threw himself on the weakly\r\nguarded centre of the long Sardinian line. Charles Albert sought too late\r\nto rejoin his northern detachments. At Custozza, on July 25, he suffered a\r\nsignal defeat. While he was thrown back over the Mincio the northern\r\ndivisions were also overcome. Charles Albert retreated to Milan closely\r\nfollowed by Radetzky. He declared himself unable to hold the city. The\r\npeople rose against him. On the night of August 5, he escaped with\r\ndifficulty, protected by General La Marmora and a few guards. Milan\r\ncapitulated on the following day. When the Austrians made their triumphant\r\nentry, half of the population left their homes to emigrate to Piedmont and\r\nSwitzerland. On August 9, an armistice was arranged at Vigevano. Venice\r\nrefused to accept it, and detaching itself once more from Sardinia,\r\nrestored Manin to power. Garibaldi with his volunteers likewise held aloof\r\nand carried the fight into the northern mountains. From there he was\r\neventually dislodged by D'Aspre and crossed the frontier into Switzerland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Raffet's battle scenes]\r\n\r\nThe picturesque scenes of the revolutionary struggle in Italy have been\r\nperpetuated by Denis-Auguste-Marie Raffet, a pupil of Charlot and of Gros,\r\nwho had already distinguished himself by his lithographs of the brief\r\nBelgian war of 1832, and by his Russian and Oriental sketches made while\r\ntravelling with Prince Demidov. The motley uniforms of the volunteers of\r\nGaribaldi, the Swiss Papal Guards and the Austrian, Piedmontese and French\r\ntroops, as well as the picturesque costumes of the Italian peasantry,\r\nafforded a great scope for Raffet's brush. One of the most characteristic\r\nspecimens of Raffet's art during this period is his well-known picture of\r\n\"The Evening of the Battle of Novara.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austrian court returns]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jellacic ban of Croatia]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Croats and Serbs secede from Magyars]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Riots in Vienna]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jellacic disavowed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil War in Hungary]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Metternich's comment]\r\n\r\nThe success of Radetzky restored a measure of confidence in Austria. The\r\nEmperor and his court, who had sought refuge at Innsbruck, consented to\r\nreturn to Vienna. There the promised elections had been held, and an\r\nassembly representing all the provinces of the Empire, excepting Hungary\r\nand Italy, had met in the third week of July. With the armies of Radetzky\r\nand Windischgrätz within call, the Emperor and his Ministry assumed a\r\nbolder front toward the Magyars. The concessions exacted by Hungary in\r\nApril had raised that kingdom almost to the position of an independent\r\nstate. Under its separate management of the Hungarian army, Austria found\r\nit difficult even to use her Magyar troops at the front in Italy. The\r\nMagyars showed the same haughty spirit toward the Austrian Serbs, Slavs and\r\nCroatians. After Hungary's successful emancipation in March, the Serbs of\r\nsouthern Hungary demanded from Kossuth the restoration of their own local\r\nautonomy. The Magyars insisted on maintaining their ascendency, and decreed\r\nthat only the Magyar language should be the language of the state. Slavic\r\nrace feeling was kindled to sudden hatred. The Croatian national committee\r\nat Agram, that had assumed charge of affairs after the catastrophe in\r\nMarch, elected Jellacic, the colonel of the first Croatian regiment, Ban of\r\nCroatia. The appointment was confirmed at Vienna, even before formal\r\nnotification had reached the Emperor. On assuming office, Jellacic caused\r\nall Magyar officials to be driven out of the country, and broke off all\r\nrelations with the Hungarian government at Pesth. Batthyany, the Hungarian\r\nPremier, hastened to Vienna, and obtained the disavowal of Jellacic. No\r\nattention was paid to this at Agram. Now, General Hrabovsky, commanding the\r\ntroops in the southern provinces, received orders from Pesth to suspend\r\nJellacic from office and bring him to trial for high treason. In the\r\nmeanwhile the Serbs, meeting in Congress at Carlowitz on the Lower Danube,\r\nproclaimed home rule, elected a Voiovode of their own and authorized him to\r\nenter into intimate relations with their fellow Slavs in Croatia. This was\r\nin the middle of May. Vienna during these same days was in a continual\r\nuproar. Early in May a report that the Austrian Ambassador at London had\r\ngiven a formal reception to Prince Metternich upon his arrival in England\r\ncaused an outbreak of popular wrath in Vienna. A mob surrounded the house\r\nof Count Ficquelmont, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and compelled him to\r\nresign his office. Detachments of troops patrolled the streets at night. On\r\nMay 15, the people revolted against this measure before the Palace, and\r\ncompelled Minister Pillersdorf to sign an order for the withdrawal of the\r\ntroops. The Emperor and his family fled to the Tyrol. At Innsbruck, where\r\nhe was received with great demonstrations of loyalty, the Emperor issued a\r\nrescript in which he declined to return to his capital or to open the\r\nnational assembly until order should be restored. In Croatia, on hearing of\r\nHrabovsky's orders, the Palatine was burned in effigy. Batthyany hastened\r\nto Innsbruck to turn this Slavic affront to the crown to account. By\r\nassuring to the Emperor the support of Hungary's troops against the\r\nItalians, Batthyany obtained the Emperor's signature to an emphatic\r\ncondemnation of Jellacic and his suspension from office. Jellacic then set\r\nout for Innsbruck, accompanied by a large deputation of Croats and Serbs.\r\nOn the day that he arrived at Innsbruck, Batthyany at Pesth published the\r\ntext of the Emperor's orders against the Ban. Still Jellacic held his\r\nground. He regained the Emperor's favor by issuing an address to the\r\nCroatian soldiers serving in Italy, enjoining them to stand by the colors\r\nno matter what reports reached them from home. He was permitted to return\r\nto Croatia and to resume his government at Agram. As soon as he reached\r\nhome, he declared himself the champion of Austrian unity, and assumed\r\ndictatorial powers. Civil war broke out in Lower Hungary. General\r\nHrabovsky, when he attempted to occupy Carlowitz, encountered serious\r\nopposition. He was attacked with such vehemence, by the Serbs led by\r\nStratimirovic, that he had to beat a retreat. The Hungarian Diet at Pesth\r\ncalled for a levy of 200,000 men to crush the Slavic rebellion. In the face\r\nof a letter from the Emperor, condemning the resistance offered to the\r\nHungarian government by the Slavs, Kossuth charged the Austrian Court with\r\ninstigating the civil war. Evidence was brought forward to show that the\r\nMinister of War at Vienna was encouraging Austrian officers to join the\r\ninsurrection. Such was the situation in Austria at midsummer. A\r\ncharacteristic comment on this apparently sudden disintegration of the\r\nAustrian Empire at this time was furnished by Prince Metternich to his\r\nfellow refugee, François Pierre Guizot, the fallen Prime Minister of\r\nFrance. \"During the catastrophes of 1848,\" writes Guizot, in his \"Mémoires\r\npour servir a l'Histoire de mon Temps,\" \"meeting Prince Metternich at\r\nLondon one day, I said to him: 'Explain to me the causes of your revolution\r\nin Austria. I know why and how things happened in Paris; but in Austria,\r\nunder your government, I cannot understand.' He replied with a smile of\r\nmingled pride and sadness: 'I have sometimes ruled Europe, but Austria\r\nnever.'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Frankfort Parliament]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John of Austria elected leader]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussia discredited]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign Powers intervene]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Truce of Malmö]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frankfort Parliament powerless]\r\n\r\nAt Frankfort, during this interval, the national parliament of Germany was\r\nconvened on May 18. The event was celebrated throughout Germany with the\r\nringing of bells and bonfires at night. In truth, the assembly was such\r\nthat Germany might well be proud of it. Of the 586 delegates, more than a\r\nhundred were university professors and scholars of eminence. Among them\r\nwere such men as Arndt, the poet, Gervinus and Dahlberg, the historians,\r\nwith others of like note. A promising unity of ideals seemed to prevail.\r\nHeinrich von Gagern, a man of high character and parliamentary experience,\r\nwas elected chairman by a majority of 305 out of 397 votes. It was his\r\nproposal to create a central executive in the person of a _Reichsverweser_.\r\nArchduke John of Austria, one of the most popular of German princes, was\r\nelected to this office by an overwhelming majority of 436 votes. The\r\nArchduke, who was then presiding over the new Austrian Assembly at Vienna,\r\naccepted the honor. By the time the German Bundestag adjourned, on July 13,\r\neverything seemed full of promise. The minor German States formally\r\nacknowledged the new Reichsverweser. King Frederick William of Prussia\r\ninvited him, together with many members of the Frankfort Parliament, to the\r\nCologne Cathedral festival on August 14. There the King pledged the\r\nArchduke at a public banquet: \"May he give us,\" declared the King, \"united\r\nand free German peoples; may he give us united and free sovereigns.\" A few\r\ndays later an event occurred which opened the eyes of the Germans to\r\nPrussia's real part in the destinies of Germany. This was the armistice of\r\nMalmö, concluded on August 26, between Denmark and Prussia. The early\r\nGerman victories at Dannewirk and Oversee had borne no fruit. The Danes\r\nwere masters of the sea, and mercilessly ravaged the German coasts,\r\nunprotected by any navy. As King Frederick William remarked, it was like a\r\nfight between a hound and a fish. The Danes took innumerable prizes and\r\ncrippled the commerce of the Hanseatic cities. General Wrangel thereupon\r\nexacted a contribution of 2,000,000 thalers in Jutland. For every\r\nfisherman's hut that the Danish fleet might injure on the German coast, he\r\nthreatened to lay a Danish village in ashes. The foreign Powers objected to\r\nsuch ruthless campaigning. The Scandinavian States intervened on behalf of\r\nDenmark. Emperor Nicholas of Russia, who regarded the Schleswig-Holstein\r\nmovement as an unjustifiable rebellion, came to their support. Lord\r\nPalmerston, who had once proposed to end the quarrel by simply cutting the\r\ndisputed territory in two, according to the preferences of the inhabitants,\r\nnow threw in the weight of England with the other Powers. Prussia was\r\nconstrained to withdraw her army. According to the provisions of the seven\r\nmonths' truce forced upon Prussia at Malmö in Sweden, all prisoners were to\r\nbe returned, the Schleswig-Holstein army was to be disbanded, while a\r\ntemporary government of the duchies was to be administered by\r\nrepresentatives of Denmark and Prussia. All Germany was in an uproar. The\r\nFrankfort Parliament repudiated the armistice by 238 against 221 votes. The\r\nnew-formed German Ministry resigned. Prof. Dahlmann, one of the\r\nprotagonists of the Schleswig-Holstein movement, was commissioned to form a\r\nnew Ministry. His efforts resulted only in failure. The conviction grew\r\nthat the German Parliament was powerless. Presently the Parliament revoked\r\nits own decision, approving the armistice by 258 over 236 votes. After all,\r\nit was plain that the most momentous German question of the day had been\r\nsettled independently of united Germany by Prussia standing alone. In South\r\nGermany the revolutionists were once more called to arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French Republic]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National workshops]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fyffe's judgment]\r\n\r\nThe new republican government of France had been kept far too busy by the\r\nlogical consequences of its revolutionary measures to take any active part\r\nin the international settlement of the Schleswig-Holstein question. The\r\nmajority of the provisional government were moderate republicans,\r\nrepresenting the _bourgeoisie_, or middle class, rather than the workmen,\r\nbut associated with them were such radicals as Louis Blanc, Ledru-Rollin\r\nand Albert, a locksmith. During the first few days of the installation they\r\nundertook to guarantee employment to every citizen. It proved a gigantic\r\nengagement. The mere distribution of idle workmen among the various\r\nindustries in which they were employed called for a new branch of the\r\nadministration. The task outgrew all expectations. Within four weeks the\r\nnumber of applicants for government work rose from 140 to 65,000. Under the\r\nstimulus of government competition, a series of labor strikes were declared\r\nagainst private factories and establishments. The scheme, as then\r\nattempted, grew utterly unmanageable. As Fyffe has said in his chapter on\r\nthis subject: \"If, instead of a group of benevolent theorists, the\r\nexperiment of 1848 had had for its authors a company of millionaires\r\nanxious to dispel all hope that mankind might ever rise to a higher order\r\nthan that of unrestricted competition of man against man, it could not have\r\nbeen conducted under more fatal conditions.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Radicals outvoted]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another attempted revolution]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National workshop abolished]\r\n\r\nThe elections of April 23 gave the moderate element a handsome majority. An\r\nattempt to change the elections was frustrated by the National Guard.\r\nStrengthened by this manifestation of popular approval, Lamartine and his\r\ncolleagues got rid of their radical associates in the Cabinet. The excluded\r\nradicals now planned a new revolution. On May 15, simultaneously with the\r\nrenewed riots in Vienna, an attempt was made to overthrow the government.\r\nOn the pretext of presenting a petition on behalf of Poland, a mob invaded\r\nthe Chambers and dissolved the Assembly. A provisional government was\r\ninstalled at the Hôtel de Ville. The government supporters rallied the\r\nNational Guard. The leaders at the Hôtel de Ville were taken captive. The\r\nPalais Bourbon was cleared, and the Deputies were reconvened in their\r\nassembly hall. Encouraged by this success, the government resolved to rid\r\nitself of the incubus of the national workshops, after a variety of schemes\r\nwith this purpose in view had been brought forward in the Assembly. The\r\ngovernment cut the Gordian knot by a violent stroke. On June 21, an edict\r\nwas issued that all beneficiaries of the public workshops between the ages\r\nof seventeen and twenty-five must enlist in the army or cease to receive\r\nsupport from the State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paris up in arms]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Archbishop killed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of bloodshed]\r\n\r\nAt this time more than a hundred thousand destitute men had flocked to the\r\nnational workshops. They rose as of one accord. The rising of June 23 was\r\nthe most formidable yet experienced in Paris. The number of the workmen\r\nalone exceeded that of several army corps. The unity of grievances and\r\ninterests gave them an _esprit de corps_ similar to that of an army. The\r\nwhole eastern part of Paris was barricaded like a fortified camp. Instead\r\nof a mere revolt, the government found itself entering upon a civil war.\r\nGeneral Cavaignac, the Minister of War, was placed in supreme command, the\r\nexecutive commission resigning its powers. He summoned all available troops\r\ninto the capital. Regardless of private interests, Paris was treated as a\r\ngreat battlefield in which the enemy was to be attacked in a mass and\r\ndislodged from all his main lines. The barricades were battered down with\r\nfield and siege artillery. Four days and nights the fight lasted. Whole\r\nhouses and blocks in which the insurgents had found a lodgment had to be\r\ndemolished. On the third day the Archbishop of Paris was struck by a bullet\r\nwhile trying to stop the bloodshed. On both sides the fight was waged with\r\ninexcusable savagery. The National Guard, with a few exceptions, fought\r\nside by side with the regular troops. The workmen, threatened with the loss\r\nof their subsistence, fought with the courage of despair. At the point of\r\nthe bayonet they were at last driven into the northeastern quarter of the\r\ncity. There, plied with grape and canister from every direction, they were\r\nbrought to the point of surrender.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cavaignac]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon]\r\n\r\nAfter this hard-won victory, the government did not hesitate to transport\r\nwithout trial the whole mass of prisoners taken alive. A policy of reaction\r\nset in. The government workshops and other concessions to socialism were\r\nabandoned. General Cavaignac, at the direction of the Assembly, retained\r\nhis dictatorial powers until a new Constitution could be drafted. It seemed\r\nas if Cavaignac was marked to become the permanent ruler of France, but his\r\nown rigid republicanism stood in his way. It was at this time that Prince\r\nLouis Napoleon once more came into prominence. When he first made his\r\nreappearance in Paris he was requested to leave by the Provisional\r\nGovernment. Retiring to England, he awaited developments, while his friends\r\nand supporters agitated in his behalf. During the supplementary elections\r\nhe was nominated for the Chambers by four districts at once, and, despite\r\nthe government's efforts, he obtained a fourfold election. A vote of the\r\nAssembly declared the election valid. With unwonted self-command the Prince\r\ndeclined to take his seat, on the ground that it might embarrass the\r\ngovernment in its difficult situation. His letter to the president of the\r\nAssembly ended with the significant declaration that if duties should be\r\nimposed upon him by the will of the people he would know how to fulfil\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: France spellbound]\r\n\r\nThree months later, in the midst of the debates on the constitution, while\r\nCavaignac was still in power, Louis Napoleon was re-elected to the\r\nAssembly--this time by five departments. His hour had come. From this\r\nmoment he was a recognized aspirant for power. The great name of his uncle\r\nshed its glory upon him. The new constitution of the Republic provided that\r\na President with executive powers should be elected by a direct vote of all\r\ncitizens. Louis Napoleon at once became a candidate. In an address to the\r\npeople he declared that he would devote himself without stint to the\r\nmaintenance of the Republic. In well-worded generalities something was\r\npromised to all the classes and parties of France. The other candidates\r\nwere Cavaignac and Lamartine. Out of seven millions of votes cast in this\r\nelection, five million went to Louis Napoleon. The mere glamour of an\r\nimperial name cast a new spell over France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Chopin]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The pianist's career]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these stirring events in Paris, Frederick Chopin, the piano\r\ncomposer, died on October 17. Born at Jelisovaya-Volia in Poland, he\r\nreceived his early musical education at Warsaw. At the age of nine he\r\nplayed a pianoforte concerto with improvisations in public. His first\r\ncompositions were Polish dances. In his fifteenth year he published a rondo\r\nand a fantasie. Having perfected himself as a pianist, he set out on a\r\nconcert tour through Vienna, Munich, Paris and London. After his first\r\nappearance in Vienna, the foremost musical critic there wrote of him: \"From\r\nthe outset Chopin took place in the front rank of masters. The perfect\r\ndelicacy of his touch, his indescribable mechanical dexterity, the\r\nmelancholy tints in his style of shading, and the rare clearness of his\r\ndelivery are in him qualities which bear the stamp of genius. He must be\r\nregarded as one of the most remarkable meteors blazing on the musical\r\nhorizon.\" In Paris he gave a concert at Pleyel's house. His reception was\r\nsuch that he gave up all idea of proceeding further and made Paris his home\r\nfor life. He was welcomed to the intimacy of men like Liszt, Berlioz,\r\nMeyerbeer, Bellini, Balzac and Heine. As one after another of his unique\r\ncompositions for the piano appeared, he took rank as the foremost composer\r\nfor that instrument. On the publication of his preludes and new Polish\r\ndances, Schumann wrote of Chopin: \"He is and ever will be the most daring\r\nand proud poetic spirit of the time.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chopin and Georges Sand]\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Chopin met Madame Dudevant, better known as the celebrated\r\nnovelist Georges Sand. Their attachment was mutual. For her he wrote some\r\nof his most inspired pieces. They spent the winter of 1838-39 together on\r\nthe Island of Majorca, where Georges Sand nursed Chopin through a severe\r\nattack of bronchitis. Of this episode, which had its profound effect on\r\nChopin's music, Georges Sand has left an unengaging record in the novel\r\n\"Lucreticia Floriani,\" published shortly afterward, and another in her\r\n\"Histoire de ma Vie.\" Chopin returned from Majorca broken in health. He was\r\nsupplanted in Georges Sand's affections by Alfred de Musset. During the\r\nseason of 1848-49 he gave concerts in London, whence he returned to Paris\r\nonly to die. He was buried at Père la Chaise, between Bellini and\r\nCherubini's graves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sicilian elections]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King of Sardinia wary]\r\n\r\nIn Italy, after the armistice between the Austrians and the Piedmontese,\r\nmatters went from bad to worse. In Sicily, a National Parliament had met\r\nand put Ruggiero Settimo at the head of affairs by a unanimous vote. King\r\nFerdinand and the House of Bourbon were declared to have forfeited the\r\ncrown of Sicily forever. Elections were ordered to call another Prince to\r\nthe vacant throne. England, interested as ever in Sicilian affairs,\r\nimpressed upon the Sicilian leaders the urgency of an early settlement. The\r\nelections were held in haste. On July 12, at two in the morning, the vote\r\nwas announced in Parliament. The Duke of Genoa, Albert Amadeus of Savoy,\r\nCharles Albert's second son, was elected King. The British and French\r\nwarships in Sicilian waters fired a royal salute. For Charles Albert this\r\nonly meant fresh embarrassment. In case of acceptance, he was sure to be\r\ninvolved in war with Naples in the south, as well as with Austria in the\r\nnorth. When the Sicilian deputies submitted their proposition in Piedmont,\r\non August 27, they obtained no definite reply.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Venice steadfast]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Riots at Bologna]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rossi, Papal Minister]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile King Ferdinand of Naples gathered his forces to win back Sicily.\r\nIn the north the cause of Italy was on the wane. Francis V. was reinstated\r\nas Duke of Modena, with the help of Austrian arms. On his return in August\r\nhe granted an amnesty, from the benefits of which \"only those who had taken\r\npart in the revolution\" were to be excluded. Austrian troops under Count\r\nThurn likewise occupied the Duchy of Parma, the Duke remaining in Germany.\r\nIn Tuscany, the Archduke found it difficult to maintain himself at\r\nFlorence. His principality was overrun by radical refugees. A revolutionary\r\njunta at Leghorn threatened to proclaim the republic unless the Duke of\r\nTuscany should appoint a governor in sympathy with their ideas. In his\r\nextremity the Duke sent them Montanelli, a political dreamer, who\r\nproclaimed Jesus Christ as the father of democracy. At Venice the Republic\r\nof St. Mark, under Manin's able leadership, still held its own. Austria's\r\noccupation of Ferrara and the Romagna brought new embarrassment to the\r\nPope. Baron Von Welden, the Austrian general, made matters worse in the\r\nRomagna by his threatening language: \"Woe to those who dare to oppose me!\"\r\nFormal protests were made in vain by Pope Pio Nono and the diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives of France and England. The Papal Ministry of Mamiani\r\nresigned. The Roman Radicals, under the leadership of Prince Canino, a\r\nBonaparte, clamored for war, and some Austrian officers dared to show\r\nthemselves in Bologna. They were attacked in the streets and murdered by\r\nthe mob. Fighting began around Bologna. Too late the Austrians consented to\r\nrelieve the Pope from this embarrassment by withdrawing their troops from\r\nhis dominions. The Pope's new Minister, Count Pellegrino Rossi, an\r\nunusually able and forceful man who had once acted as an envoy for Louis\r\nPhilippe, was denounced as a Frenchman and an enemy to Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bombardment of Messina]\r\n\r\nIn September, King Ferdinand of Naples, having got rid of his Parliament,\r\nlaunched his forces upon Sicily. General Filangieri, with 12,000 men, was\r\nsent against Messina. There the Neapolitan garrison still held the\r\ncitadel--all that remained to Ferdinand of his Sicilian kingdom. Three\r\ndays before Filangieri landed, the gunners in the citadel began to bombard\r\nthe helpless town lying beneath them. Half of the city was laid in ruins.\r\nThe foreign warships in the harbor were filled with refugees. It was this\r\noutrage that gave to King Ferdinand the nickname of \"King Bomba.\" The\r\ninhabitants remained steadfast. When Filangieri effected his landing, the\r\nfight was carried on with ferocity. The fall of the city was followed by\r\nbarbarous excesses. For three days incendiary fires raged in the hapless\r\ntown. At last the foreign admirals, Parker and Baudin, put a stop to the\r\nhorrors, \"as against all canons of civilized nations.\" An armistice was\r\nestablished between the Neapolitans and the Sicilians. King Ferdinand's\r\ndogged resistance to the remonstrances of the French and English\r\nAmbassadors was strengthened by the latest event in Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assassination of Rossi]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of Pio Nono]\r\n\r\nOn November 15, as the Roman Chambers were about to be opened, Prime\r\nMinister Rossi was assassinated as he left his carriage to enter the\r\nChambers. It was the signal for a new revolt. The delegates in the Hall of\r\nChambers sought safety in flight. The National Guards made common cause\r\nwith the insurgents. A howling mob beset the Quirinal. But for the resolute\r\nstand of the Pope's Swiss mercenaries, the palace would have been stormed.\r\nAs bullets penetrated the walls of the Pope's ante-chamber, Pio Nono\r\nexclaimed: \"Has Heaven no lightning?\" For a while the Pope was practically\r\na prisoner in his palace, while the Prince of Panino and Sterbini, the\r\nPresident of the Circolo Popolare, ruled Rome. At last, on the night of\r\nNovember 24, Pio Nono, in the disguise of a groom, escaped from Rome,\r\nseated on the box of the carriage of the Bavarian Ambassador, Count Spaur.\r\nHe fled to Naples. From the Neapolitan fortress Gaeta he sent a letter to\r\nhis \"dearest son,\" the Emperor of Austria, imploring his help against the\r\nRepublic of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt in Frankfort]\r\n\r\nAt Frankfort, the ratification of the armistice of Malmö by the German\r\nParliament had aroused the Radicals to fury. On September 17, the day after\r\nthe second vote on this matter, a mass meeting was called at Frankfort. One\r\ndelegate, Zitz, proposed the abolition of the Parliament; another, Ludwig\r\nSimon, declared the time had come to discuss all further questions from\r\nbehind barricades. The Municipal Senate of Frankfort, taking alarm, ordered\r\nout the city troops and appealed for help to Prussia. On the morrow\r\nfighting began in the streets of Frankfort. Barricades had been erected\r\novernight, and all day long the insurgents held their ground. It was known\r\nthat a Prussian column was approaching. Prince Lichnovsky and General Von\r\nAuerswald, two leaders of the Conservative majority in the Parliament,\r\nrashly undertook to meet the Prussian troops halfway. At the gates of\r\nFrankfort both men were seized by the insurgents and were lynched by the\r\nmob. Shortly before midnight the Prussian troops arrived and soon overran\r\nthe barricades with their bayonets. On the following day the city was under\r\nmilitary rule.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South Germany restive]\r\n\r\nIn other parts of South Germany revolution had broken out anew. The Prince\r\nof Sigmaringen was driven from his little domain, which was proclaimed a\r\nrepublic. Insurgent expeditions were organized in Wurtemberg and Baden.\r\nThere Karl Blind and Gustav Struve made another attempt on Freiburg. At\r\nStaufen, on September 24, they were beaten back by regular troops under\r\nGeneral Hoffmann and fled toward Switzerland. Struve himself was captured\r\nnear the frontier. On the same day the German Cabinet at Frankfort was\r\nreinstated. Still the ill success of popular government in Germany brought\r\nthe Parliament into lasting disrepute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reaction in Berlin]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brandenburg Prime Minister]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussian Parliament dissolved]\r\n\r\nThe reaction was first felt at Berlin. There the return of General\r\nWrangel's troops from Denmark was followed by friction between the soldiers\r\nand the democratic agitators in the streets. A resolution was passed in the\r\npopular Parliament of Prussia that all officers out of sympathy with\r\ndemocratic government should be encouraged to leave the army. The failure\r\nof the Minister of War to act on this suggestion was followed by his\r\ndownfall. Having succeeded in this, the parliamentary majority next passed\r\na vote to eliminate the words \"by the grace of God\" from the titles of the\r\nKing. Toward the end of October a national convention of democrats met at\r\nBerlin, and held its sessions amid tumultuous scenes in the streets. In\r\nexasperation, the King dissolved the Cabinet that had been forced upon him,\r\nand commissioned Count Brandenburg, a natural son of Frederick William II.,\r\nto form another. It included Major-General von Strotha, Minister of War,\r\nand Otto von Manteuffel, Minister of the Interior. The Parliament sent a\r\ndeputation to remonstrate with the King. One of the delegates, Jacoby, as\r\nthe King terminated the audience, called after him: \"Behold the chief\r\nmisfortune of kings, that they will not listen to the truth!\" Immediately\r\nafter this King Frederick William IV. prorogued the Parliament to the town\r\nof Brandenburg. The majority of the delegates declined to adjourn. The\r\nCabinet Ministers, followed by the members that had been outvoted, left the\r\nhall. On November 15, the remaining Parliament issued a proclamation to the\r\npeople to withhold all further payment of taxes. General Wrangel posted his\r\ntroops throughout Berlin. The Municipal Guards of Berlin were dissolved. An\r\nattempt on the part of the Parliament to meet again was easily frustrated.\r\nThe taxes were collected as before. When the Parliamentary minority came to\r\norder at Brandenburg their sessions were dissolved by royal order. On his\r\nown initiative, King Frederick William IV. now proclaimed a constitution.\r\nThe Chambers, provisions for which were contained in this royal\r\nconstitution, were to meet at Berlin on February 24, 1849. Such was the end\r\nof the People's Parliament in Prussia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WAGNER AND LISZT\r\n    Painted by W. Beckmann]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Robert Blum, one of the radical Parliamentarians of\r\nFrankfort, was shot in Austria. Together with Froebel, he had been\r\ndespatched to Vienna by the Parliamentary minority in Frankfort with\r\nmessages of sympathy for the popular cause in Austria. To offset this, the\r\nmajority sent two delegates to the Emperor to offer the Parliament's good\r\nservices for mediation with his rebellious subjects. They were coolly\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slav Congress of Prague]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bohemian revolt suppressed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ferdinand's duplicity]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Archduke Stephen withdraws]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kossuth in power]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murder of General Lamberg]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Count Zichy shot]\r\n\r\nAll Austria was in a state of civil war. After the example of the Slavs in\r\nServia and Croatia, the Czechs of Bohemia rose at Prague. Austrian-German\r\nauthority there collapsed. A National Guard was organized, and a popular\r\nAssembly convened. In midsummer a Congress of Slavs from all parts of\r\nAustria met at Prague. Popular excitement rose to a threatening pitch. On\r\nthe day that the Panslavistic Congress broke up, barricades were erected\r\nand fighting began in the streets of Prague. The wife of Count\r\nWindischgrätz, the military commandant, was killed by a bullet.\r\nWindischgrätz, after withdrawing his troops, threatened to bombard the city\r\nunless the barricades were removed. This was not done. Windischgrätz then\r\ntook the city by storm. Military law was proclaimed. This success, like\r\nthat of Radetzky's arms in Italy, gave new hope to the Austrian Emperor. He\r\npronounced his veto on Hungary's military measures against Croatia. A\r\nhundred delegates from the Magyar Diet at Pesth posted to Vienna to exact\r\nfrom the Emperor the fulfilment of his promises to Hungary. On September 9,\r\nthe Emperor received them at his palace with renewed assurances that he\r\nwould keep his plighted word. A few hours afterward the official \"Gazette\"\r\npublished a letter over the Emperor's signature, expressing his full\r\napproval of Jellacic's measures in Croatia. This was all Jellacic had been\r\nwaiting for. On September 11, he crossed the Drave with his Croatians and\r\nmarched upon Pesth. Archduke Stephen, the Hungarian Palatine, took command\r\nof the Magyar army and went to the front. At Lake Balaton he requested a\r\nconference with Jellacic. The Ban paid no attention to it. Realizing the\r\nsecret support given to Jellacic by the Crown, Archduke Stephen resigned\r\nhis command in Hungary. The Emperor now appointed General Lamberg at Vienna\r\nto the supreme command over the military forces of Hungary as well as\r\nCroatia. At the same time the Austrian Cabinet submitted a memorial\r\nsuggesting that the laws establishing Hungarian autonomy be declared null\r\nand void. On the publication of this memorial in Pesth, Batthyany's\r\nMinistry resigned. Kossuth openly proposed war with Austria. When Lamberg\r\narrived at Pesth, Kossuth prevailed upon the Diet to withhold its\r\nratification of Lamberg's appointment. Should Lamberg attempt to resume his\r\nmilitary command Kossuth demanded that he should be outlawed as a traitor.\r\nAs General Lamberg crossed the bridge at Budapesth he was recognized by the\r\npopulace. A cry was raised that he meant to seize the citadel and bombard\r\nthe town. He was dragged from his carriage and torn to pieces by the mob.\r\nHis body was dragged through the streets, and finally strung up before one\r\nof the government buildings. A few days later, Count Zichy, one of the\r\nMagyar magnates, was court-martialled by order of Arthur Goergey, the\r\nHungarian Honved leader, for entering into a correspondence with Jellacic,\r\nand was shot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Imperial rescript repudiated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troops mutiny in Vienna]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of Emperor]\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of this news, Emperor Ferdinand declared the Hungarian\r\nParliament dissolved, and pronounced all its acts null and void. Jellacic\r\nwas appointed representative of Austria in Hungary with command of all the\r\nforces. The Magyar Diet repudiated the Emperor's manifesto as a breach of\r\nthe constitution, and pronounced Jellacic a traitor. Jellacic's forces were\r\nchecked by the Hungarian army in their advance upon Pesth. General Latour,\r\nthe Austrian Minister of War, ordered a division of troops at Vienna to go\r\nto the support of Jellacic. The Magyar sympathizers at Vienna raised a\r\nfearful uproar. As the troops were marching out of the city several\r\nbattalions were prevailed upon to mutiny. The Hungarian flag was hoisted\r\nabove the Cathedral of St. Stephen. The National Guard joined the mutiny.\r\nOther battalions of the line were driven out of the city. The guards at the\r\narsenal capitulated. Vienna was at the mercy of the insurgents. The\r\nEmperor, who had sought refuge at Schoenbrunn, left his palace at four on\r\nthe morning of October 1, and fled to Olmütz.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jellacic marches on Vienna]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Windischgrätz moves from Bohemia]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assault on Vienna]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival of Hungarians]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of the Schwechat]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of these events reached Jellacic he evacuated his\r\nthreatened positions on the banks of the Raab and marched for Vienna.\r\nWindischgrätz, with his garrison, set out from Prague. Revolutionists of\r\nall races flocked into Vienna. Among them were the German delegates Froebel\r\nand Blum, and the Polish general, Bem. The Hungarians pursued Jellacic no\r\nfurther than their frontier. The regiments expelled from Vienna, under the\r\ncommand of Count Auersperg, joined forces with Jellacic. The insurgents at\r\nVienna manned their fortifications as well as they could, and called upon\r\nthe people throughout Austria to take up arms. Emperor Ferdinand, at\r\nOlmütz, offset this by an imperial proclamation to his people in which he\r\nguaranteed all peasant rights. Prince Windischgrätz was created a field\r\nmarshal, with full command over all the forces in the empire, except those\r\nunder Radetzky in Italy. Windischgrätz took immediate steps to effect a\r\njunction with Jellacic by seizing the bridges at Krems and Stein. In vain\r\ndid the delegates from Frankfort, who now appeared upon the scene, present\r\ntheir offer of intervention. Windischgrätz would not listen to them. On\r\nOctober 23, the Austrian army, 80,000 strong, appeared before Vienna. The\r\ndefence of the city had been intrusted to Captain Messenhauser, an officer\r\nof the regular army, and to General Bem. Robert Blum, the German\r\nParliamentarian, fought in the ranks. While Windischgrätz was wasting his\r\ntime in parleys, an army of 18,000 Hungarians crossed the frontier and\r\nthreatened Jellacic's rear. On October 28, twenty-four hours after the time\r\nfixed in Windischgrätz's last ultimatum, he began his assault on the city.\r\nIn the course of an all-day fight the troops succeeded in taking the\r\nsuburbs. The scenes of that night were frightful. The troops bivouacked on\r\nthe ramparts. The following Sunday was spent in further parleys. Already\r\nthe terms of capitulation had been settled, when Messenhauser, from the top\r\nof the church of St. Stephen, made out the approaching columns of the\r\nHungarians. The news of their arrival was signalled to the city by a column\r\nof smoke rising from the top of the tower. All negotiations for surrender\r\nwere dropped. The Hungarians attacked Jellacic on the banks of the\r\nSchwechat, within a few leagues of the capital. The boom of their artillery\r\ncould be plainly heard in Vienna. In a frenzy of enthusiasm the Viennese\r\nresumed the struggle. A corps of students attempted a sortie. Unfortunately\r\nfor them, the engagement on the banks of the Schwechat turned against the\r\nHungarians. Shortly after noon they gave way all along the line and fell\r\nback toward Hungary. On the ramparts of Vienna the hopeless fight of a few\r\nthousand civilians against an army of 90,000 men was continued until\r\nnightfall. At six in the evening the troops broke into the city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Vienna]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stadion's Ministry]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abdication of Ferdinand]\r\n\r\nOn the following day, November 1, Prince Windischgrätz declared Vienna\r\nunder military law. All arms had to be delivered within forty-eight hours.\r\nArrests and courts-martial followed in profusion. Robert Blum was one of\r\nthe first to be shot. His colleague, Froebel, owed his life to a political\r\npamphlet signed with his name, in which he had defended the interests of\r\nAustria against those of a united Germany. A new Ministry was installed,\r\nunder the leadership of the notorious Prince Felix Schwarzenberg and Count\r\nStadion. They announced their programme to be the maintenance of a strong\r\ncentral government and the integrity of the Austrian Empire, with quick\r\nsuppression of the civil war in Hungary. A new Reichsrath was convoked at\r\nthe village of Kremsier, near Olmütz. On December 2, it was announced that\r\nEmperor Ferdinand had resolved to abdicate his throne. His brother,\r\nArchduke Francis Charles, renounced the succession. The Archduke's son,\r\nFrancis Joseph, a youth of eighteen, was declared by a family council to\r\nhave attained his majority. In virtue of this he ascended the throne as\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis Joseph, Emperor]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The war in Hungary]\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian Diet, on learning of this transfer of the crown, refused to\r\nacknowledge Francis Joseph as King of Hungary. The whole nation was\r\nsummoned to arms. The command of the army was given to Goergey. His first\r\nserious problem was a rising of the Roumanians in Transylvania against\r\nMagyar rule. The Roumanian peasants committed all conceivable atrocities.\r\nWhen they raised the standard of the Empire, the Austrian commander,\r\nGeneral Puchner, espoused their cause. Transylvania was lost to Hungary.\r\nThe Roumanians led by Puchner co-operated with Jellacic's forces in\r\nCroatia, and moved on Hungary from that quarter. On December 15, the main\r\nAustrian army, under Windischgrätz, crossed over the River Leitha and\r\ninvaded Hungary. Goergey declared from the first that Pesth would have to\r\nbe abandoned. Kossuth's frantic efforts to prevent this only served to\r\nhamper Goergey's able campaign. One line after another had to be abandoned.\r\nAt last, toward the close of the year, Kossuth and his Magyar Diet were\r\ncompelled to evacuate Pesth. The Hungarian army fell back over the River\r\nTheiss, upon the fortress of Comorn, and the mountainous regions of\r\nnorthern Hungary. Kossuth's government was established at Debreczin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1849\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bem's aggressive campaign]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goergey and Dembinsky]\r\n\r\nOn January 5, Windischgrätz and Jellacic made their triumphant entry into\r\nBudapesth. The Vienna \"Gazette\" announced \"the glorious end of the\r\nHungarian campaign.\" Prince Windischgrätz rested on his arms. During this\r\ninterval the Polish general, Bem, who had escaped from Vienna, aroused his\r\ncountrymen in Siebenbürgen and carried the war into that region. The\r\nAustrian troops under General Puchner were beaten in a series of\r\nengagements. Goergey, aided by another Pole, Dembinsky, repulsed the\r\nAustrian troops under General Schlik in the north. While Windischgrätz\r\nremained idle at Pesth, Klapkah, the new Hungarian Minister of War,\r\norganized the Magyar forces and created new defences for his country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Afghan war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chilian Wallah]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Gough superseded]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Battle of the Guns\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Punjab annexed to England]\r\n\r\nPrince Metternich, whiling away his idle hours among other notable refugees\r\nat London and Brighton, now had the satisfaction of seeing the dangers of\r\nrevolt brought home to the people of England. The tidings of a disaster in\r\nAfghanistan provoked an outburst of alarm and indignation in England. On\r\nJanuary 13, Lord Gough had advanced on Sher Singh's intrenchments at\r\nChilian Wallah. They were held by 30,000 Sikhs with sixty guns, screened by\r\na thick jungle. As the British imprudently exposed themselves the Sikhs\r\nopened fire. Lord Gough ordered a general charge. The drawn battle that\r\nfollowed proved the bloodiest affair in the history of British India.\r\nDriven from their first line of defences, the Sikhs stood their ground in\r\nanother stronger position, and repulsed the British attack. Nearly 2,500\r\nBritish officers and men fell in the fight. In the face of the Afghan\r\nrejoicings Lord Gough claimed a victory. The British War Office, however,\r\nhastily despatched Sir Charles Napier to India to supersede Lord Gough.\r\nThere was still time for that commander to retrieve himself. General Whish\r\ncaptured the town of Multan, and by terrible bombardment of the citadel\r\nbrought Mulraj to surrender. General Whish then joined forces with Lord\r\nGough in his final struggle with Sher Singh. At Guzerat, on February 22,\r\nLord Gough achieved the crowning victory known as \"the battle of the guns.\"\r\nFor two hours a terrific artillery duel was maintained, the Sikhs firing\r\nwith all their sixty pieces. Finally the British stormed their batteries in\r\na combined charge of bayonets and cavalry. The Sikh forces were scattered,\r\nand their camp, with most of their standards and guns, were captured by the\r\nBritish. Dost Muhammad Khan and his Afghans were driven out of Peshawar and\r\nnarrowly escaped to Kabul. Mulraj was imprisoned for life. The whole of the\r\nPunjab was annexed to British India. A successful administration of this\r\nhostile province was Lord Dalhousie's first great triumph.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Taylor inaugurated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of Western America]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Forty-Niners\"]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, General Taylor, the conqueror of Buena Vista, was\r\ninaugurated as President of the United States. One sentence in his\r\ninaugural address provoked derision: \"We are at peace with all the world\r\nand the rest of mankind.\" The old Spanish missions in the conquered\r\nterritory were deprived of their wealth and influence. The name of San\r\nFrancisco was adopted in place of Yerba Buena. Besides California, the new\r\nterritory included the subsequently admitted States of Nevada, Arizona,\r\nUtah, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado, Wyoming and Kansas. The Apache and\r\nNavajo Indians in those regions gave immediate trouble. The gold seekers\r\ntracking across the plains were the first to suffer from the Indians. Still\r\nthe stream of immigrants poured into California. Their halfway stations on\r\nthe Missouri River developed into the two thriving towns of Omaha and\r\nCouncil Bluffs. The Bay of San Francisco was soon surrounded by a\r\nsettlement of tents and sheds. A Vigilance Committee took affairs into its\r\nown hands, and administered justice without fear or favor. Six times the\r\nnew city was destroyed by fire. Within two months all traces of the\r\ndisaster would be lost. California soon had a population entitling it to\r\nStatehood. President Taylor eagerly seconded the wishes of the people for a\r\ngovernment of their own. The first Constitutional Convention of California\r\ndeclared against slavery. More than $40,000,000 worth of gold was produced\r\nin the new State, and the first gold dollars were coined.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Poe]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Posthumous poems]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Conqueror Worm\"]\r\n\r\nThe death of Edgar Allan Poe, the American poet, was as tragic as his life\r\nhad been. After the death of his wife, Poe had engaged himself to marry a\r\nwealthy lady in Richmond, and the wedding day was fixed. On his way to New\r\nYork to settle up affairs in anticipation of his marriage, Poe fell in with\r\nsome of his companions in dissipation at Baltimore. He became drunk,\r\nwandered through the streets, and was finally taken to a hospital in an\r\nunconscious condition. Later he became delirious and finally expired,\r\nsaying: \"Lord, help my poor soul!\" After Poe's death the simplest and\r\nsweetest of his ballads, \"Annabel Lee,\" and the wonderful poem of \"The\r\nBells,\" were published. His former friend and editor, Griswold, published a\r\nscathing denunciation of the dead man in the New York \"Tribune.\" Poe's fame\r\nas a master of the weird and fanciful in literature was already established\r\nwherever his thrilling tales and superb poem \"The Raven\" had penetrated. He\r\nwas one of the few poets of America at that period who had succeeded in\r\nachieving an international reputation. The best of his poems were rendered\r\nin choice French by Baudelaire, while his short stories were translated\r\ninto almost all European languages. As his biographer, Woodberry, has said:\r\n\"On the roll of American literature Poe's name is inscribed with the few\r\nforemost, and in the world at large his genius is established as valid\r\namong all men. Much as he derived nurture from other sources, he was the\r\nson of Coleridge by the weird touch in his imagination, by the principles\r\nof his analytic criticism, and the speculative bent of his mind.\" Most\r\ncharacteristic of Poe's genius perhaps are these lines from his famous\r\npoem \"The Conqueror Worm\":\r\n\r\n  Lo! 'tis a gala night\r\n  Within the lonesome latter years!\r\n  An angel throng, bewinged, bedight\r\n  In veils, and drowned in tears,\r\n  Sit in a theatre, to see\r\n  A play of hopes and fears,\r\n  While the orchestra breathes fitfully\r\n  The music of the spheres.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  That motley drama--oh, be sure\r\n  It shall not be forgot!\r\n  With its Phantom chased for evermore\r\n  By a crowd that seize it not,\r\n  Through a circle that ever returneth in\r\n  To the self-same spot,\r\n  And much of Madness, and more of Sin,\r\n  And Horror the soul of the plot.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Out--out are the lights--out all!\r\n  And over each quivering form\r\n  The curtain, a funeral pall,\r\n  Comes down with the rush of a storm,\r\n  And the angels, all pallid and wan,\r\n  Uprising, unveiling, affirm\r\n  That the play is the tragedy \"Man,\"\r\n  And its hero the Conqueror Worm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abortive Spanish rising]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italian republics]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Situation in Sicily]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the startling upheavals of the previous year were followed by an\r\naftermath no less startling. Even in Spain, where a first attempt at\r\nrevolution had easily been crushed at Madrid, Don Carlos deemed the time\r\nripe to join Cabrera's revolutionary rising in Catalonia. On his way there\r\nhe was arrested at the French frontier. Deprived of his support, Cabrera\r\nhimself had to remove his forces to French soil. In Italy, the\r\nrevolutionary movement spread. On February 7, Duke Leopold of Florence was\r\ndriven out of Tuscany. A republican government was established at Florence\r\nunder the triumvirate of Guerazzi, Montanelli and Manzoni. Taking refuge on\r\na British man-of-war, the Duke of Tuscany fled to Gaeta to share the Pope's\r\nexile there. On the same day that the new republic was proclaimed at\r\nFlorence a popular assembly at Rome formally deposed the Pope from temporal\r\npower and proclaimed the Republic of Rome. The armistice in Sicily was\r\nabout to expire. King Ferdinand's final concessions to his rebellious\r\nsubjects were repudiated. Lord Palmerston, who had vainly offered British\r\nmediation to Ferdinand, on the floor of Parliament openly defended the\r\nuncompromising attitude of the Sicilians. In preparation for the inevitable\r\nconflict, Filangieri gathered an army of 20,000 Neapolitans, while\r\nMierolavsky, a Pole, took command of the Sicilian insurgents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hungarian defeats]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austrian reverses]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Windischgrätz \"Reconcentrates\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hungarian declaration of independence]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tide of war set against the Hungarians. On February 4, Bem\r\nwas defeated on the site of his former victory at Hermannstadt. While\r\nretreating he was defeated again at Paiski. By the middle of February the\r\nAustrians succeeded in taking the fortress of Essek from the Hungarians.\r\nToward the close of the month a disastrous defeat was inflicted upon the\r\nHungarians under the command of General Dembinsky at Kapolna. Kossuth had\r\nmade the mistake of superseding Goergey by that commander. Now Goergey was\r\nreinstated. The Hungarians rallied. On March 5, the Magyar Csikos, or\r\nirregular cavalry, under Janos Damjanies, defeated the Austrians under\r\nGeneral Grammont at Szolnok. A few days later the Hungarian army in\r\nTransylvania, under General Bem, retrieved their ill-fortune by another\r\nglorious victory at Hermannstadt. A Russian contingent from Wallachia,\r\nwhich had crossed the frontier to assist the Austrians, was defeated by Bem\r\nat Brasso. General Puchner and his Russian allies sought refuge across the\r\nborder. Goergey relieved Komorn. The ablest of the Austrian generals,\r\nSchlik, was beaten at Hapvan, while Jellacic was overthrown at Isaszteg and\r\nGoedoelloe. Prince Windischgrätz had to give up Pesth, or, as he put it in\r\nhis immortal thirty-fourth bulletin: \"Reconcentrate the army in front of\r\nBudapesth, a movement hastily imitated by the enemy.\" Goergey added another\r\ntouch of humor by attributing the Hungarian victory solely to the activity\r\nof Windischgrätz and Jellacic. On March 4, Emperor Francis Joseph had\r\nannulled the old Hungarian constitution. Kossuth retaliated in kind. Under\r\nhis influence the Magyar Diet at Debreczin pronounced the deposition of the\r\nHouse of Hapsburg from the throne of Hungary and declared the independence\r\nof Hungary and the adjoining southern provinces. While the Hungarian army,\r\ninstead of marching on Vienna, lost valuable time before Ofen, the Austrian\r\nGovernment improved the interval to perfect its long-threatened alliance\r\nwith Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sardinia renews war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polish leaders]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Five Days' Campaign\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Novara]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italian retreat]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D'Aspre's heavy losses]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles Albert abdicates]\r\n\r\nIn the interim war had broken out anew in Schleswig-Holstein and in Italy.\r\nBefore the expiration of the Austrian-Italian armistice, Charles Albert of\r\nSardinia, in a spirited address on February 1, announced his determination\r\nto renew the war. To this desperate resolve he was driven by the increasing\r\nturbulence of Italian affairs. The spread of the revolutionary movement to\r\nhis dominions could be forestalled only by placing himself once more at the\r\nhead of the Italian movement. In some respects the moment appeared\r\npropitious. Charles Albert's army now numbered a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand men, while Radetzky had little more than seventy thousand\r\nAustrians. A characteristic note of the times was the appointment of Poles\r\nto command the Italian troops. Prince Chrzanovsky, who had fought under\r\nNapoleon at Leipzig and Waterloo, and had subsequently commanded a Russian\r\ndivision at Varna, was put in supreme command, seconded by Alexander La\r\nMarmora. Another Pole, or half Pole, Ramorino, who had figured in the\r\nunfortunate rising of 1833, commanded the legion of Lombardy. On March 12,\r\nthe pending termination of the truce was officially announced. At noon on\r\nMarch 20, hostilities were to be resumed. The campaign that followed lasted\r\nbut five days. Radetzky, by his preliminary feint, made the Italians\r\nbelieve that he would evacuate Lombardy as heretofore; but at the last\r\nmoment he quickly concentrated his five army corps at Pavia. At the stroke\r\nof noon, on March 20, he threw his army across the Tessino on three\r\nbridges. While the Italians believed that Radetzky was retreating on the\r\nAdda, the Austrians were already bivouacking on the flank of the\r\nPiedmontese army. Three bloody engagements at Mortara, Gambola and\r\nSforzesca, on March 21, ended in a retreat of the Italians all along the\r\nline. Ramorino had received orders to move northward and to destroy the\r\nbridges behind him. Out of accord with his countryman, Chrzanovsky, he\r\ndisobeyed his orders and lingered at Stradella. Radetzky flung his army in\r\nbetween, and cut off the Italian line of retreat upon Turin and\r\nAlessandria. It was then that Benedek, an Austrian colonel, distinguished\r\nhimself by leading his troops far in advance of the Austrian army, and\r\ncutting his way through an Italian brigade, under the cover of night. At\r\nmidnight of March 21, Charles Albert had to order a general retreat on\r\nNovara. There Chrzanovsky determined to make a stand with his main column\r\nof about 50,000 men. Radetzky was in doubt whether the Italians had fallen\r\nback on Novara or Vercelli. To make sure he sent his troops in either\r\ndirection. He himself remained at his headquarters, so as to be ready to\r\nride either way. The roar of artillery from Novara, on the morning of March\r\n23, told him where the battle was to be fought. There General D'Aspre,\r\ncommanding the second Austrian army corps, undertook to win some laurels on\r\nhis own account by a bold attack on the superior position of the Italians.\r\nAs Charles Albert rode out of the gate of Novara he received the last\r\ncheers of his devoted Bersaglieri. After a three hours' fight the scale\r\nturned against the Austrians. Count D'Aspre repented of his rashness, and\r\nsent for help to Count Thurn at Vercelli. Fortunately for him, Radetzky and\r\nThurn had marched in that direction as soon as they heard the sound of the\r\ncannon. It was a race between the two divisions. As Radetzky, at the head\r\nof the first army corps, galloped through Nebola, the aged marshal met the\r\nretreating columns of D'Aspre's second corps. Both the first and the third\r\nAustrian corps rushed into the battle almost simultaneously. The Italian\r\nadvance was checked. At last, when Thurn's fourth corps arrived at sundown,\r\nthe Austrian bugles sounded for a general charge. The Italian line of\r\nbattle was overthrown. The Austrian cavalry circled around the flank. While\r\nthe Italians fled into Novara they suffered from the fire of their own\r\nartillery. Charles Albert was one of the last who left the Bicocca to seek\r\nrefuge in Novara. The town itself was bombarded by the Austrian artillery\r\nfar into the night. Standing on the ramparts of Novara, Charles Albert\r\nrealized the disastrous nature of his defeat. His losses aggregated more\r\nthan seven thousand, of whom three thousand had been taken captive. Of the\r\nAustrian losses of 3,158 men, five-sevenths fell to D'Aspre's corps. The\r\nother Austrian divisions were practically intact. The Italians were in\r\nconfusion. Charles Albert, who throughout the day had exposed his person\r\nwith the utmost gallantry, had to be dragged from the ramparts by General\r\nDurando. As the Austrian shells struck all around them he exclaimed, \"Leave\r\nme, General. Let it be the last day of my life. I wish to die.\" At last he\r\nconsented to send his Minister, Cadorna, to Radetzky's headquarters to sue\r\nfor an armistice. Cadorna was received in an insulting manner. Charles\r\nAlbert came to the conclusion that his own person was an obstacle in the\r\nway of peace. That night he resigned his crown. In the presence of his\r\ngenerals he pronounced his eldest son, Victor Emmanuel, King of Sardinia.\r\nAccompanied by but one attendant he left Novara, and passed unrecognized\r\nthrough the enemy's lines. Sending a farewell letter to his wife, he went\r\ninto exile. A few months later he died at Oporto in Portugal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Charles Albert]\r\n\r\nAs Fyffe has said of this unfortunate Prince: \"Nothing in his reign became\r\nhim like the ending of it. He proved that there was one sovereign in Italy\r\nwho was willing to stake his throne, his life, the whole sum of his\r\npersonal interests, for the national cause.... The man who, beaten and\r\noutnumbered, had for hours sat immovable in front of the Austrian cannon in\r\nNovara, had, in the depth of his misfortune, given to his son not the crown\r\nof Piedmont only, but the crown of Italy.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victor Emmanuel yields]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italian Princes reinstated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French expedition to Rome]\r\n\r\nOn the day after the battle of Novara, King Victor Emmanuel sought out\r\nMarshal Radetzky and came to terms. Venice and the Italian duchies had to\r\nbe relinquished to the Austrians. Austrian troops, in conjunction with\r\nthose of Piedmont, occupied Alessandria. Piedmont was to reduce its army to\r\na peace footing, to disperse all volunteers, and to pay a war indemnity of\r\n75,000,000 francs. The Austrian demand that Victor Emmanuel should annul\r\nthe liberal constitution granted by his father was unconditionally refused.\r\nFor this Piedmont had to suffer a prolonged military occupation by Austrian\r\ntroops, but Victor Emmanuel, by the same token, retained his father's\r\nclaim to the leadership of the national cause of Italy. The victory of\r\nAustrian arms was speedily followed by the return of the princes of\r\nnorthern Italy to their petty thrones. Radetzky's troops undertook the\r\nreconquest of Venice. To forestall an Austrian movement against Rome,\r\nFrance undertook to reinstate Pio Nono in the Holy Chair of St. Peter. A\r\nFrench expedition under Oudinot, a son of the famous marshal, disembarked\r\nat Civita Vecchia. Mazzini and Garibaldi alone rallied their men to the\r\ndefence of the republic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subjection of Sicily]\r\n\r\nIn Sicily, hostilities had been likewise renewed on March 29. The Sicilians\r\nwere discouraged by the report of the Italian defeats in the north.\r\nFilangieri succeeded in capturing Taormina, the Sicilian base of supplies.\r\nIn the defence of Catania the Polish general commanding the Sicilian\r\ntroops, Mierolavsky, was severely wounded. At the foot of Mount Etna, the\r\nSicilians were again defeated on April 6, Good Friday. Catania was taken.\r\nSyracuse surrendered to the Neapolitan fleet. Filangieri's army penetrated\r\ninto the interior. In vain did the English and Austrian Ambassadors offer\r\nmediation. Ruggiero Settimo resigned his Presidency of the Sicilian\r\nRepublic. The heads of the insurrection fled the country. Palermo\r\nsurrendered. The customary courts-martial and military executions followed.\r\nUntil the accession of King Ferdinand's eldest son to the throne,\r\nFilangieri ruled as military governor. In commemoration of one of the\r\ncities he had laid in ashes, he was created Duke of Taormina. When England\r\ntried to exact the promised recognition of the Constitution of 1812, King\r\nFerdinand rejected the proposal with the sardonic statement that peace had\r\nbeen re-established in Sicily, and everybody was content.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danish war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dueppel trenches stormed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Gudsoe]\r\n\r\nThe armistice of Malmö with Denmark expired on February 26. The German\r\nBundestag mobilized three divisions of the allied German federation. Within\r\na month Prussian, Bavarian and Swabian troops marched into Holstein. A\r\nPrussian general, Von Prittwitz, assumed supreme command. On April 3, the\r\nDanes opened hostilities by a bombardment of the Island of Allston. Then\r\ncame the battle of Eckenfoerde, when German shore batteries blew up the\r\nDanish ship of the line, \"Christian VIII.,\" and two smaller vessels, the\r\ncrews of which surrendered. On April 13, the Bavarians and Saxons stormed\r\nthe intrenchments of Dueppel. One week later, the German troops, in\r\nconjunction with the volunteers of Schleswig-Holstein, under Von Bonin,\r\noccupied Jutland, and defeated the Danes at Kolding. A Danish advance from\r\nFridericia was repulsed after a seven hours' fight, on May 7, at Gudsoe.\r\nThe Danes fell back on Fridericia, where they were invested.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Francis Joseph's \"Constitution\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German Constitution adopted]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German imperial crown rejected]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the German Parliament had met again at Frankfort. After the\r\nresignation of the former Austrian chief of the Cabinet, Schmerling, the\r\nParliament was split into two factions, according to their preferences for\r\na German union with or without Austria. Early in January it had been\r\ndecided to elect some German prince to assume the leadership of German\r\naffairs as Emperor of the Germans. To this plan the minor German\r\nsovereigns gave their consent. During the first week of March, when the\r\nEmperor of Austria issued his new Constitution, which declared the whole of\r\nthe Austrian Empire under one indivisible constitutional monarchy, it was\r\nplain to the German delegates that Austria could no longer be reckoned on.\r\nOn March 28, King Frederick IV. of Prussia was elected by 290 votes. Some\r\n284 delegates, among whom were 100 Austrians, abstained from voting. An\r\nimperial constitution was adopted which limited the former sovereign rights\r\nof the various principalities, declared for the liberties of speech and of\r\nthe press, religious worship, free public schools, and the total abolition\r\nof all feudal titles of nobility. On April 23, the great Parliamentary\r\ndeputation, with President Simpson at its head, came to Berlin to notify\r\nthe King of Prussia of his election. To the consternation of all, Frederick\r\nWilliam declined the honor. He explained in private that he did not care\r\n\"to accept a crown offered to him by the Revolution.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Saxon revolution]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South German risings]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German Parliament dispersed]\r\n\r\nThe immediate effects of his rejection were new attempts at revolution in\r\nGermany. After Frederick William's refusal to enter into the plans of the\r\nGerman Parliament, this body fell into utter disrepute. Its radical\r\nelements could no longer be kept in control. Armed revolts, encouraged by\r\nthe radical delegates, broke out in Frankfort, Kaiserslautern and\r\nthroughout Saxony. The King of Saxony, with his Ministers, Von Beust and\r\nRabenhorst, fled from Dresden. From the barricades the provisional\r\ngovernment was proclaimed. The garrison was at the mercy of the insurgents,\r\ngreat numbers of whom flocked to Dresden from Leipzig and Pirna. Prussian\r\ntroops overran Saxony. The revolutionary movement spread to Hesse, Baden,\r\nthe Rhine provinces, Wurtemberg and the Bavarian Palatinate. Encounters\r\nwith the troops occurred at Elbafeldt, Düsseldorf and Cologne. The reserves\r\nand municipal guards sided with the insurgents. All Baden rose and declared\r\nitself a republic, forming an alliance with the revolted Palatinate. The\r\npeople of Wurtemberg, in a turbulent mass-meeting, demanded coalition with\r\nboth of these countries. It was then that the Parliament at Frankfort\r\ndecided to hold its future sessions at Stuttgart. Those principalities\r\nwhich had not yet succumbed to revolution withdrew their delegates. Prussia\r\nnow gave to the Parliament its _coup de grace_ by arrogating to herself all\r\nfurther prosecution of the Danish war, on the ground that \"the so-called\r\ncentral government of Frankfort had no more weight of its own to affect the\r\nbalance of peace or war.\" The remnants of the Parliament tried to meet at\r\nStuttgart, under the leadership of Loewe and Ludwig Uhland, the foremost\r\nliving poet of Germany. When they came together at their meeting hall they\r\nfound the doors blocked by troops. Attempts at protest were drowned by the\r\nroll of drums. Under the threat of a volley the delegates dispersed. Such\r\nwas the end of the first German Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Princes reinstated]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Fridericia]\r\n\r\nPrussian troops advanced into the Palatinate, Baden and Wurtemberg. After\r\ndesultory encounters with ill-led bands of insurgents, the sovereigns of\r\nthese principalities were reinstated on their thrones by the Prussian\r\narmy. The refugees thronged into Switzerland. In the north, on the other\r\nhand, Prussia's further advance into Denmark was stopped by the\r\nthreatening attitude of England, Russia and France. On July 5, the Danes\r\nmade a sortie from Fridericia and inflicted a crushing defeat on the\r\nSchleswig-Holsteiners, capturing 28 guns and 1,500 prisoners. The Germans\r\nlost nearly 3,000 men in dead and wounded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danish armistice]\r\n\r\nFive days after this disgrace to German arms, the Prussian Government\r\naccepted an armistice, according to which Schleswig was to be cut in two to\r\nbe occupied by Swedish and Prussian troops. The provisional government of\r\nthis province was intrusted to a joint commission, presided over by an\r\nEnglishman. Holstein was abandoned to its fate. The final downfall of all\r\nthe ideals of the German Liberals was followed by a feeling of dejection in\r\nGermany akin to despair. The number of immigrants who left Germany to seek\r\nnew homes in America and elsewhere rose abruptly to 113,000 persons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austrian-Russian alliance]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians invade Hungary]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Budapesth]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Last Hungarian victories]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kemmisvar]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surrender of Vilagos]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Batthyany hanged]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hungary crushed]\r\n\r\nWorse even than in Germany fared the cause of popular government in\r\nHungary. On the day that Goergey's Hungarians stormed Ofen (May 21),\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph had a personal interview with Czar Nicholas at\r\nWarsaw. A joint note announced that the interest of all European States\r\ndemanded armed interference in Hungary. The Emperor of Russia placed his\r\nwhole army, under the command of Paskievitch, at the disposal of his \"dear\r\nbrother, Francis Joseph.\" On June 3, the vanguard of the Russian main army\r\noccupied Pressburg. Paskievitch called upon all Magyars to submit. Instead\r\nof that, Kossuth called upon his countrymen to destroy their homes and\r\nproperty at the approach of the enemy, and to retreat into the interior as\r\ndid the Russians before Napoleon. The rapid course of military events made\r\nthis impracticable. While Kossuth and his government retired to Scegedin in\r\nthe far southeast, Goergey, with the bulk of the army, took post on the\r\nupper Danube to prevent the junction of the Austrians and Russians. There\r\nthe notorious Haynau, who had been recalled from Italy, was in command.\r\nWhile Goergey attacked his left wing on the River Vag, Haynau perfected his\r\njunction with the Russians. On June 28 their united forces, 80,000 strong,\r\ncaptured Raab, under the eyes of Francis Joseph. The Russians occupied\r\nDebreczin, while the Austrians moved on Budapesth. Goergey's attempts to\r\nstop them resulted only in placing him in a dangerous position between both\r\narmies. On the same day that the Austrians reoccupied Budapesth, the\r\nHungarians under Vetter succeeded in inflicting another disastrous defeat\r\non Jellacic at Hegyes. Three days later, Goergey won his last victory over\r\nthe Russians at Waitzen. After this the tide of war turned against Hungary.\r\nThe united army of Austria and Russia exceeded 225,000 men and 600 guns.\r\nThe Hungarian resources were exhausted. In the first week of August the\r\nfinal conclusion of peace between Austria and Sardinia and the victorious\r\nmovement against Venice put new forces at Austria's disposal. Dembinsky,\r\nwho was to defend the passage of the Theiss before Scegedin, was defeated,\r\non August 5, at Czoreg with heavy losses. Kossuth now gave the command to\r\nBem. He fought the last battle of the campaign at Kemmisvar, on August 9,\r\nending in the disastrous defeat of the Hungarians. Bem barely succeeded in\r\nsaving the remnant of his army by crossing the Moldavian frontier. On\r\nAugust 11, Kossuth at Arad relinquished his dictatorship in favor of\r\nGeneral Goergey. This headstrong soldier, in realization of his\r\nhelplessness, led his army of 20,000 foot, 2,000 horse and 130 guns within\r\nthe Russian lines at Vilagos and surrendered unconditionally. Goergey's\r\nlife was spared. Not so those of his foremost fellow prisoners, who were\r\nhanded over to the tender mercies of Haynau. \"Hungary,\" wrote Paskievitch\r\nto the Czar, \"lies at the feet of your Majesty.\" Goergey's galling\r\nexplanation that he did not deign to surrender to his despised Austrian\r\nadversaries was brutally avenged by Haynau. The foremost Magyar officers\r\nand statesmen who fell into Austrian hands were court-martialled and shot.\r\nCount Batthyany, the former Prime Minister, was hanged as a common felon.\r\nHungary lost all her ancient constitutional rights, besides her former\r\nterritories of Transylvania and Croatia. The flower of her youth was\r\nenrolled in Austrian ranks and dispersed to the most remote garrisons of\r\nthe empire. Her civil administration was handed over to German bureaucrats\r\nfrom Austria. The exiled patriots sought refuge in Turkey and in America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paris insurrection suppressed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French enter Rome]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of Garibaldi]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pio Nono firm]\r\n\r\nThe French interference in Rome aroused the Republicans in France. While\r\nOudinot was carrying on siege operations against Rome, Ledru-Rollin, in\r\nParis, demanded the impeachment of the Ministry. The rejection of this\r\nmotion by the Chambers was followed by revolutionary risings at Paris,\r\nLyons, Marseilles and other cities. Then it was shown that France had a new\r\nmaster. President Louis Napoleon was on his guard. Large forces of troops,\r\nheld in readiness for this event, put down the insurrections without much\r\ntrouble. The siege of Rome was pressed to its conclusion. On June 14,\r\nOudinot began his bombardment of Rome. Garibaldi prolonged his defence\r\nuntil the end of the month. Then, when sufficient breaches had been opened,\r\nthe French stormed the ramparts and entered Rome. Garibaldi attempted to\r\nthrow his forces into Venice to prolong the war against Austria. With his\r\never-dwindling followers he was hunted from place to place. In the end,\r\nthrough the devotion of Italian patriots, he managed to escape to America.\r\nOn July 14, the restoration of the Pope's authority over Rome was announced\r\nby Oudinot. Pio Nono, however, showed no inclination to place himself in\r\nthe power of his protectors. Remaining at Gaeta, he sent a commission of\r\ncardinals to take over the government of Rome. Their first act was to\r\nrestore the Inquisition, and to appoint a court for the trial of all\r\npersons implicated in the Roman revolution. Thereat great wrath arose\r\namong the Republicans of France. Louis Napoleon felt compromised. In\r\nreliance on the growing ascendency of Austria, the Pope insisted on his\r\nabsolute rights as a sovereign of Rome. All that Pio Nono would consent to,\r\nunder the pressure of the French Government, was to suffer his political\r\nprisoners to go into exile, and to bestow a small measure of local powers\r\nupon the municipalities of the various States.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Rome and of Hungary no hope remained for Venice. A\r\nfortnight after the surrender of Vilagos, and several months after the\r\nsubjugation of the Venetian mainland, the Republic of St. Mark, reduced by\r\ncholera and famine, gave up its long struggle. The Austrians re-entered\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nHaving gained a free hand in her Hungarian and Italian dominions, Austria\r\nset to work to recover her ascendency in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1850\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blockade of the Piræus]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cholera in England]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the year the British Foreign Office determined to bring\r\npressure to bear upon Greece for payment of the public debts which were\r\nowing to English bankers. A British squadron, during January, blockaded the\r\nPiræus. On January 17, a resolution was passed in the British House of\r\nLords condemning the foreign policy of the government in Greece. Later\r\nFrance interposed in behalf of Greece and the blockade was discontinued.\r\nThroughout the earlier part of the year the scourge of cholera continued in\r\nEngland. In London alone the death-rate for a while was 1,000 per week.\r\nMore than 50,000 people died from the epidemic in England and Wales.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Wordsworth]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Lyrical Ballads\" and \"Peter Bell\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Lake School\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wordsworth's doctrine]\r\n\r\nWilliam Wordsworth, the English Poet Laureate, died on April 23, at Rydal\r\nMount. Born at Cockermouth in 1770, Wordsworth received his academic\r\neducation at Cambridge University. Two years after his graduation, he made\r\nhis first appearance as a poet with the publication of \"An Evening Walk; an\r\nEpistle in Verse.\" In the same year he published \"Descriptive Sketches in\r\nVerse,\" inspired by a pedestrian tour through the Alps. These poems brought\r\nthe appreciation of Coleridge, and both men soon became friends. Together\r\nwith Wordsworth's sister they made a tour of Germany. On their return,\r\nWordsworth brought out the first volume of his \"Lyrical Ballads,\" which won\r\ngreat popularity, and the anonymous \"Peter Bell,\" the most condemned of all\r\nhis poems. After his marriage in 1803, Wordsworth settled at Grasmere in\r\nthe lake country, where he was joined by Southey and Coleridge. This caused\r\nthe writings of all three to be classified under the generic title of \"The\r\nLake School of Poetry\" by the \"Edinburgh Review.\" The fame of Wordsworth's\r\npoetic productions, and especially of his sonnets, slowly grew. While he\r\nwon the immediate approbation of his countrymen by some of his stirring\r\npatriotic pieces, his strongest appeal to the world at large and to future\r\ngenerations lay in his poetic appreciation of the beauties of nature and of\r\nthe essential traits of human character. As he sang in the famous preface\r\nto \"The Excursion\":\r\n\r\n  Beauty--a living presence of the earth,\r\n  Surpassing the most fair ideal forms\r\n  Which craft of delicate spirits hath composed\r\n  From earth's materials--waits upon my steps;\r\n  Pitches her tents before me as I move,\r\n  An hourly neighbor. Paradise, and groves\r\n  Elysian, Fortunate Fields--like those of old\r\n  Sought in the Atlantic main--why should they be\r\n  A history only of departed things,\r\n  Or a mere fiction of what never was?\r\n  For the discerning intellect of man,\r\n  When wedded to this goodly universe\r\n  In love and holy passion, shall find these\r\n  A simple produce of the common day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ode on immortality]\r\n\r\nThe annunciation of this doctrine was greeted by the critic of the\r\n\"Edinburgh Review\" with the insolent: \"This will never do.\" In truth,\r\nWordsworth's fondness for the inner beauty of common things sometimes led\r\nhis verse into the commonplace. Wordsworth reached the height of his poetic\r\nfervor in his \"Ode on the Intimations of Immortality,\" containing the\r\nfamous lines:\r\n\r\n  Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\r\n  The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,\r\n      Hath had elsewhere its setting,\r\n      And cometh from afar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shelley's sonnet to Wordsworth]\r\n\r\nIt is at the end of this ode that Wordsworth summed up his veneration for\r\nnature in the lines:\r\n\r\n  To me the meanest flower that blows can give\r\n  Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his friend Southey, the mantle of the Poet Laureate fell\r\nupon him. His acceptance of this honor, and of the humble office of stamp\r\ndistributer in the counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland, was decried by\r\nsome of his fellow poets as a sordid compromise. Robert Browning then wrote\r\nhis stirring invective, \"The Lost Leader,\" while Shelley wrote the famous\r\nsonnet addressed to Wordsworth:\r\n\r\n  Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know\r\n  That things depart which never may return:\r\n  Childhood and youth, friendship and love's first glow,\r\n  Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving thee to mourn.\r\n  These common woes I feel. One loss is mine\r\n  Which thou too feel'st, yet I alone deplore.\r\n  Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine\r\n  On some frail bark in winter's midnight roar,\r\n  Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stood\r\n  Above the blind and battling multitude:\r\n  In honored poverty thy voice did weave\r\n  Songs consecrate to truth and liberty--\r\n  Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,\r\n  Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Prelude\"]\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel's recognition of Wordsworth's genius, on the other hand,\r\nwas regarded by the English Liberals as one of the brightest points in that\r\nfamous statesman's career. The University of Oxford, shortly afterward,\r\nbestowed upon Wordsworth an honorary degree. One of Wordsworth's latest\r\npoems was addressed to the Mount of Wanswell, rising above his country home\r\nat Ambroside, closing with the prophetic lines:\r\n\r\n                  When we are gone\r\n  From every object dear to mortal sight,\r\n  As soon we shall be, may these words attest\r\n  How oft, to elevate our spirits, shone\r\n  Thy visionary majesties of light,\r\n  How in thy pensive glooms our hearts found rest.\r\n\r\nAfter Wordsworth's death, appeared \"The Prelude, or Growth of the Poet's\r\nMind,\" an autobiographical poem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Peel]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First international cable]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Koh-i-noor]\r\n\r\nThe next noted death in England this year was that of Sir Robert Peel,\r\nwhich occurred after a stirring debate on the foreign policy of Lord\r\nPalmerston in Greece. On the following day Peel was thrown from his horse\r\nwhile riding near London. The injuries he received were such that he died\r\nthree days later. A monument to his memory was erected in Westminster\r\nAbbey; but in accordance with his own wish he was buried in the village\r\nchurchyard of Drayton Bassett. Of other events arousing interest in\r\nEngland, the most noteworthy was the laying of the first submarine electric\r\ntelegraph between England and France. The cable, which was twenty-seven\r\nmiles long and covered with gutta-percha, stretched from Dover to Cape Gris\r\nNez. Messages were interchanged, but the cable soon parted. During the\r\nsame year the great East Indian diamond, Koh-i-noor, was presented to Queen\r\nVictoria. The history of this great jewel was more stirring, in its way,\r\nthan that of any living man. Its original weight was nearly 800 carats. By\r\nthe lack of skill of the European diamond cutters this was reduced to 270\r\ncarats.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Taouk Wang]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hien Fong, Emperor]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Taiping rebellion]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese emigration]\r\n\r\nBeyond the immediate shores of England the course of events kept the\r\nBritish Colonial Office fully occupied. In Canada, a movement arose for the\r\nannexation of British America to the United States. Earl Grey, the Colonial\r\nSecretary, took occasion to warn all Canadians against this movement as an\r\nact of high treason. In India, the Afghans succeeded in reconquering Balkh.\r\nThe fifth Kaffir war broke out in South Africa. The affairs of China gave\r\nfresh concern. On February 24, Emperor Taouk Wang died in his sixty-ninth\r\nyear. The thirty years during which he reigned were among the most\r\neventful, and in some respects the most portentous, for China. His\r\nstrenuous opposition to the evils of the opium trade mark him as a wise, if\r\nnot a powerful, ruler. He never wasted the public moneys of China on his\r\nown person, and his expenditures in behalf of the court and mere pomp were\r\nless than that of most of his predecessors. One of Taouk Wang's last acts\r\nshowed how his mind and his health had been affected by the recent\r\nmisfortunes of the empire. It appeared that the Chinese New Year's\r\nDay--February 12, 1850--was marked by an eclipse of the sun. Such an event\r\nbeing considered inauspicious in China, the Emperor decreed that the new\r\nyear should begin on the previous day. The decree was utterly disregarded,\r\nand the Chinese year began at the appointed time. Taouk Wang's end was\r\nhastened by the outbreak of a great fire in Pekin, which threatened the\r\nimperial city with destruction. On February 25, a grand council was held in\r\nthe Emperor's bedchamber, and Taouk Wang wrote in his bed an edict\r\nproclaiming his fourth son, Yihchoo, ruler of the empire. Prince Yihchoo,\r\nwho was less than twenty years old, took the name of Hien Fong, which means\r\ngreat abundance, and immediately upon his accession drew to his aid his\r\nfour younger brothers, a new departure in Manchu rule. Their uncle, Hwuy\r\nWang, who had made one attempt to seize the throne from his brother Taouk\r\nWang, once more put forward his pretensions. After the imperial Ministers,\r\nKiaying and Muchangah, had been degraded, Hwuy Wang's attempt signally\r\nfailed, but his life was spared. Later in the year, as a result partly of\r\npoor harvests, the great Taiping rebellion began. The great secret society\r\nof the Triads started the movement by raising an outcry in southern China\r\nagainst the Manchus. Their leader, Hung Tsiuen, a Hakka or Romany,\r\nproclaimed himself as Tien Wang, which means the head of the Prince. Under\r\nthe cloud of the impending upheaval, Chinese coolies in great numbers began\r\nto emigrate to the United States. At the same time the bitter feeling\r\nagainst foreigners was intensified by an encounter of the British\r\nsteamship \"Media\" with a fleet of piratical Chinese junks. Thirteen of the\r\njunks were destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: California an American issue]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fugitive slave bill]\r\n\r\nIn California, where most of the Chinese immigrants landed, this movement\r\nwas scarcely considered in the heat of the discussion whether California\r\nshould be admitted into the Union as a pro-slavery or anti-slavery State.\r\nIn the American Senate, Henry Clay introduced a bill for a compromise of\r\nthe controversy on slavery. His proposal favored the admission of\r\nCalifornia as a free State. On March 7, Daniel Webster delivered a\r\nmemorable speech in which he antagonized his anti-slavery friends in the\r\nNorth. This was denounced as the betrayal of his constituents. State\r\nConventions in South Carolina called for a Southern Congress to voice their\r\nclaims. Not long afterward a fugitive slave bill was adopted by the United\r\nStates Congress. A fine of $1,000 and six months' imprisonment was to be\r\nimposed on any person harboring a fugitive slave or aiding him to escape.\r\nFugitives were to be surrendered on demand, without the benefit of\r\ntestimony or trial by jury. This served to terrorize some 20,000 escaped\r\nslaves and created intense indignation in the North. The issues were still\r\nmore sharply drawn by the resignation of Jefferson Davis from the Senate,\r\nto run as a State-rights candidate for Governor of Mississippi. His\r\nUnionist rival, Foote, was elected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American filibusters in Cuba]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bulwer-Clayton treaty]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Friction with Portugal]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile trouble had arisen with Spain and Portugal. On May 19,\r\nGeneral Narcisso Lopez, with 600 American filibusters, landed at Cardenas\r\nto liberate Cuba from the dominion of Spain. He was defeated and his\r\nexpedition dispersed. Another Cuban expedition was agitated in America. On\r\nApril 25, President Taylor felt constrained to issue a second proclamation\r\nagainst filibusters. In May, the United States, in conjunction with Great\r\nBritain, recognized the independence of the Dominican Republic. Both\r\ncountries at the same time agreed not to interfere in the affairs of\r\nCentral America. In accordance with this agreement the famous\r\nBulwer-Clayton Treaty was completed. It provided that neither country\r\nshould obtain exclusive control over any inter-oceanic canal in Central\r\nAmerica, nor erect fortifications along its line. In June an American\r\nsquadron was sent to Portugal to support the United States demand for\r\nAmerican war claims of 1812. The claims were refused and the American\r\nMinister was recalled from Lisbon. The American fleet was withdrawn without\r\nfurther hostile demonstrations. The American President, in pursuance of his\r\npolicy of peace, proclaimed neutrality in the civil war which had arisen in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shields' prophecy]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Webster scourged]\r\n\r\nThe furious slavery debate was resumed when Clay's so-called \"Omnibus Bill\"\r\nwas offered for final consideration. It was during this debate that Senator\r\nShields of California uttered his famous prophecy that the United States,\r\nso far from dissolving, would within a few generations send its soldiers to\r\nAsia and into China. On July 9, Webster soothed the angry passions of the\r\nlegislators when he announced that President Taylor was dying. Webster's\r\nsupport of the Compromise Act of 1850, with its fugitive slave bill,\r\ndimmed his Presidential prospects. It was then that Whittier wrote the\r\nscathing lines entitled \"Ichabod\":\r\n\r\n  So fallen! so lost! the light withdrawn\r\n    Which once he wore!\r\n  The glory from his gray hairs gone\r\n    For evermore!\r\n\r\n  Revile him not! the tempter hath\r\n    A snare for all;\r\n  And pitying tears, not scorn and wrath,\r\n    Befit his fall.\r\n\r\n  Oh, dumb be passion's stormy rage,\r\n    When he who might\r\n  Have lighted up and led his age\r\n    Falls back in night!\r\n\r\n  Scorn! would the angels laugh to mark\r\n    A bright soul driven,\r\n  Fiend-goaded, down the endless dark,\r\n    From hope and heaven?\r\n\r\n  Let not the land once proud of him\r\n    Insult him now,\r\n  Nor brand with deeper shame his dim\r\n    Dishonor'd brow!\r\n\r\n  But let its humbled sons, instead,\r\n    From sea to lake,\r\n  A long lament, as for the dead,\r\n    In sadness make!\r\n\r\n  Of all we loved and honor'd naught\r\n    Save power remains,\r\n  A fallen angel's pride of thought\r\n    Still strong in chains.\r\n\r\n  All else is gone; from those great eyes\r\n    The soul has fled:\r\n  When faith is lost, when honor dies.\r\n    The man is dead.\r\n\r\n  Then pay the reverence of old days\r\n    To his dead fame!\r\n  Walk backward, with averted gaze,\r\n    And hide the shame!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Calhoun]\r\n\r\nJohn Caldwell Calhoun, after a final speech on the issues of the country,\r\ndied on the last day of March. He was the most prominent advocate of State\r\nsovereignty. He was noted for his keen logic, his clear statements and\r\ndemonstrations of facts, and his profound earnestness. Webster said\r\nconcerning him that he had \"the indisputable basis of high character,\r\nunspotted integrity, and honor unimpeached. Nothing grovelling, low, or\r\nmean, or selfish came near his head, or his heart.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of President Taylor]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fillmore's Presidency]\r\n\r\nOn July 9, President Taylor died, and Vice-President Fillmore succeeded\r\nhim. He received the resignations of all the Cabinet. His new Cabinet was\r\nheaded by Webster, Secretary of State (succeeded by Everett in 1852). The\r\nnew fugitive slave bill was signed by Fillmore. But the law was defied in\r\nthe North as unconstitutional. Benton called the measure \"the complex,\r\ncumbersome, expensive, annoying and ineffective fugitive slave law.\" In\r\nBoston occurred the cases of the fugitives Shadrach, Simms and Anthony\r\nBurns. Fillmore and Webster came to be looked upon in the North as traitors\r\nto the anti-slavery cause. But for this Fillmore would have had a fair\r\nchance of re-election to the Presidency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Scarlet Letter\"]\r\n\r\nThen appeared in the \"National Era\" at Washington the opening chapters of\r\nHarriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" A million copies of the book\r\nwere sold in America and in Europe. It spread and intensified the feeling\r\nagainst slavery. Emerson published \"Representative Men\"; Hawthorne \"The\r\nScarlet Letter\"; and Whittier brought out his \"Songs of Labor.\" Parodi,\r\nthe Italian singer, made her first appearance in America. She was eclipsed\r\npresently by Jenny Lind, whose opening concert at Castle Garden in New York\r\nnetted $30,000 to her manager, Barnum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian conscription]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schleswig-Holstein abandoned]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibsen]\r\n\r\nUnder the stress of another Mohammedan rising against the Christians in\r\nSyria and the Balkans, Emperor Nicholas of Russia decreed a notable\r\nincrease of the Russian army. Out of every thousand persons in the\r\npopulation seven men were mustered into the ranks in western Russia, thus\r\nadding some 180,000 men to the total strength of the Russian force. In\r\nmidsummer, the city of Cracow, in Poland, was nearly destroyed by fire.\r\nLater in the year occurred the death of the Polish general Bem, in Turkey,\r\nwho had won such distinction while serving the cause of Hungary. Another\r\nattempt to win Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark was made in summer. Unaided\r\nby the Germans, the Schleswig-Holsteiners, under the leadership of\r\nWillisen, a former Prussian general and distinguished theoretical\r\nstrategist, engaged a superior Danish army at Idstedt. They were beaten.\r\nTheir defeat had so discouraging an effect that Prussia abandoned the\r\nstruggle in their behalf. In Norway, about this time, Henrik Ibsen came\r\ninto prominence with a publication of his early drama \"Catalina.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dumas Fils]\r\n\r\nIn France, the younger Dumas proved himself a formidable rival of his\r\nfather by such works as his \"Trois Hommes\" and \"Henri de Navarre.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Balzac]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Human Comedy\"]\r\n\r\nThe death of Honoré de Balzac, the celebrated French novelist, was an event\r\nin literature. Born at Tours in 1799, he soon devoted himself to writing.\r\nHis first work, the tragedy \"Cromwell,\" written at the age of nineteen,\r\nproved unsuccessful, as did all of his earlier novels, which appeared under\r\na pseudonym. Various unfortunate undertakings, such as the publication of\r\nnew editions of \"La Fontaine\" and \"Molière,\" plunged him into debt. He\r\nreturned to writing novels. Not until late was his authorship openly\r\navowed. By this time several of his stories, such as \"Le Dernier Chouan,\"\r\n\"La Femme de Trente Ans,\" and his sprightly \"Physiologie du Mariage,\" had\r\nachieved immense success. Still Balzac failed to turn his successes to\r\nfinancial account. He sank ever deeper in debt. In 1843 he turned upon his\r\ncritics with a slashing \"Monograph on the Parisian Press.\" The major part\r\nof his striking, realistic novels was published in the famous series \"La\r\nComédie Humaine.\" This in turn was divided into these seven parts: \"Scenes\r\nof Private Life,\" \"Life in the Provinces,\" \"Life in Paris,\" \"In Politics,\"\r\n\"In the Army,\" \"In the Country,\" with \"Philosophical Studies\" and \"Studies\r\nin Analysis.\" In his preface of 1842, Balzac thus explained the scheme of\r\nhis work:\r\n\r\n     \"In giving the general title of 'The Human Comedy' to a work begun\r\n     nearly thirteen years ago, it is necessary to explain its motive, to\r\n     relate its origin, and briefly sketch its plan, while endeavoring to\r\n     speak of these matters as though I had no personal interest in them.\r\n     This is not so difficult as many imagine. Few works conduce to much\r\n     vanity; much labor conduces to great diffidence....\r\n\r\n     \"As we read the dry and discouraging list of events called History,\r\n     who can have failed to note that the writers of all periods, in Egypt,\r\n     Persia, Greece and Rome, have forgotten to give us the history of\r\n     manners? The fragment of Petronius on the private life of the Romans\r\n     excites rather than satisfies our curiosity....\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: The novel defined]\r\n\r\n     \"A sure grasp of the purport of this work will make it clear that I\r\n     attach to common, daily facts, hidden or patent to the eye, to the\r\n     acts of individual lives, and to their causes and principles, the\r\n     importance which historians have hitherto ascribed to the events of\r\n     public national life.... I have had to do what Richardson did but\r\n     once. Lovelace has a thousand forms, for social corruption takes the\r\n     hues of the medium in which it lives. Clarissa, on the contrary, the\r\n     lovely image of impassioned virtue, is drawn in lines of distracting\r\n     purity. To create a variety of Virgins it needs a Raphael.\r\n\r\n     \"It was no small task to depict the two or three thousand conspicuous\r\n     types of a period; for this is, in fact, the number presented to us by\r\n     each generation, and which the Human Comedy must require. This crowd\r\n     of actors, of characters, this multitude of lives, needed a\r\n     setting--if I may be pardoned the expression, a gallery. Hence the\r\n     division into Scenes of Private Life, of Provincial Life, of Parisian,\r\n     Political, Military and Country Life. Under these six heads are\r\n     classified all the studies of manners which form the history of\r\n     society at large.\r\n\r\n     \"The vastness of a plan which includes both a history and a criticism\r\n     of society, an analysis of its evils, and a discussion of its\r\n     principles, authorizes me, I think, in giving to my work the title\r\n     'The Human Comedy.' Is this too ambitious?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Balzac's Works]\r\n\r\nAltogether, Balzac brought out more than a hundred prose romances. They\r\ncontain the most graphic pictures of the life of the French people under\r\nLouis Philippe. Balzac said of himself that he described people as they\r\nwere, while others described them as they should be. A few months before\r\nhis death Balzac improved his circumstances by a marriage with the rich\r\nCountess Hanska. On his death Victor Hugo delivered the funeral oration,\r\nwhile Alexandre Dumas, his rival throughout life, erected a monument to him\r\nwith his own means.\r\n\r\nOne week later Louis Philippe, the deposed King of France, died at\r\nClaremont in England, in his seventy-seventh year. His career, from the\r\ntime that he followed the example of his father, Philippe Egalité, by\r\nfighting the battles of the Revolution, and through the vicissitudes of his\r\nexile until he became King in 1830, was replete with stirring episodes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Gay-Lussac]\r\n\r\nGay-Lussac, the great French chemist and physicist, died during the same\r\nyear. Born at Saint Léonard, Haut-Vienne, in 1788, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac\r\ndistinguished himself early in his career as a scientist by his aerial\r\nvoyages in company with Biot for the observation of atmospheric phenomena\r\nat great heights. In 1816, he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the\r\nPolytechnic School of Paris, a chair which he held until 1832. Promoted to\r\na professorship at the Jardin des Plantes, Gay-Lussac labored there\r\nincessantly until his death. There is scarcely a branch of physical or\r\nchemical science to which Gay-Lussac did not contribute some important\r\ndiscovery. He is noted chiefly for his experiments with gases and for the\r\ndiscovery of the law of combination by volumes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon's presidency]\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon, while administering affairs as President, began to let\r\nFrance feel his power. Early in the year he created his incapable uncle,\r\nJerome Bonaparte, a marshal of France. On August 15, his Napoleonic\r\naspirations were encouraged by a grand banquet tendered to him at Lyons.\r\nHis government felt strong enough to enact new measures for the restriction\r\nof the liberty of the press.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussian constitution]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South German alliance]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Denmark's integrity guaranteed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hessians resist despotism]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, as well as in Austria and Russia, similar reactionary measures\r\nwere enforced. Frederick William IV. of Prussia for a while appeared\r\nanxious to undo the effects of his narrow policy of the previous year. A\r\nconstitution had been adopted in Prussia on the last day of January, and on\r\nFebruary 6 the King took the constitutional oath. Austria now began to edge\r\nher way back into the management of German affairs. Under her influence\r\nHanover withdrew from the alliance of the three North German powers,\r\nHanover, Saxony and Prussia. Later Saxony also withdrew. On February 27,\r\nthe Kings of Bavaria, Wurtemberg and Saxony signed a joint agreement for a\r\nrestoration of the German Confederation and a maintenance of the federal\r\nunion. The Emperor of Austria gave to this scheme his full support. When\r\nthe Bundestag met again at Frankfort, Austria insisted on her rights as a\r\nGerman State. Too late the Prussian representative advocated a German\r\nfederal State, with Austria excluded. The disastrous failure of Prussian\r\nintervention in Schleswig-Holstein about this time brought Prussia into\r\nfurther disrepute with the rest of Germany. England, France and Sweden\r\nunited to guarantee the integrity of Denmark. Prussia left the Duchies to\r\ntheir fate. On July 19, Austria called for another assembly of the old\r\nConfederation. Prussia and her adherents could not join. On August 17, the\r\nGerman sovereigns met on the call of Austria at Frankfort to consider a\r\nplan of federal union. The old Bundestag was reopened at Frankfort on\r\nSeptember 2, under the auspices of Austria. Prussia clung to her rival\r\nfederal union. A bone of contention was furnished by the little State of\r\nHesse. The Archduke of Hesse, the most reactionary of German princes, had\r\nresumed his rule with the help of his hated Prime Minister, Hassenpflug.\r\nThe financial budget of this Minister was disapproved by the Hessian\r\nEstates. Hassenpflug now dissolved the Assembly and proceeded to levy taxes\r\nwithout its sanction. The people refused to pay. The courts decided against\r\nthe government. Even the soldiers and their officers declined to lift a\r\nfinger against the people. In the face of this resolute attitude the Prince\r\nand his Minister fled the country, on September 12, and appealed to the new\r\nBundestag at Frankfort for help. The restoration of the Archduke to his\r\nthrone was decreed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussians intervene]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austria prepares for war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussia cowed]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hessia ground under]\r\n\r\nPrussia now took a decided stand. On September 26, General von Radowitz,\r\nthe originator of the North German Union, was placed at the head of\r\nPrussia's foreign affairs. He declared for the cause of the people in\r\nHesse. The Prussian troops were withdrawn from Baden over the military\r\nroads leading through Hesse. To meet this situation, Francis Joseph of\r\nAustria, in October, had a personal interview with the Kings of Bavaria\r\nand of Wurtemberg at Bregenz. It was decided to crowd the Prussians out of\r\nBaden and Hesse by moving Bavarian and Austrian troops into those\r\ncountries. Another personal conference between Francis Joseph and Czar\r\nNicholas at Warsaw assured to Austria the support of Russia. In vain did\r\nFrederick William send his cousin, Count Brandenburg, to win over the Czar\r\nto his side. Count Brandenburg met with so haughty a reception that he\r\nreturned chagrined, and, falling ill, died soon afterward. Both Austria and\r\nPrussia mobilized their armies. At Vienna the Austrian Prime Minister\r\navowed to the Ambassador of France that it was his policy to \"avilir la\r\nPrussie, puis la démolir.\" On November 8, the vanguards of the Prussian and\r\nAustrian troops exchanged shots. The single casualty of a bugler's horse\r\nserved only to tickle the German sense of humor. The Prussians retired\r\nwithout further encounters. Radowitz resigned his Ministry. Otto von\r\nManteuffel was put in charge. On November 21, the Austrian Ambassador at\r\nBerlin, Prince Schwarzenberg, demanded the evacuation of Hesse within\r\nforty-eight hours. Prussia gave in. Manteuffel requested the favor of a\r\npersonal interview at Olmütz. Without awaiting Austria's reply he posted\r\nthither. In a treaty signed at Olmütz late in the year, Prussia agreed to\r\nwithdraw her troops from Baden and Hesse, and to annul her military\r\nconventions with Baden, Anhalt, Mecklenburg and Brunswick. Thus miserably\r\nended Prussia's first attempt to exclude Austria from the affairs of\r\nGermany. As heretofore, the Prussian-Polish provinces of Posen and Silesia\r\nwere excluded from the Confederation. Austria, on the other hand, tried to\r\nbring her subjected provinces in Italy and Hungary into the Germanic\r\nConfederation. Against this proposition, repugnant to most Germans, France\r\nand England lodged so vigorous a protest that the plan was abandoned. The\r\nElector of Hesse-Cassel returned to his capital. Under the protection of\r\nthe federal bayonets he was able to bring his wretched subjects to complete\r\nsubjection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gervinus]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richard Wagner]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lenau]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lenau's pessimism]\r\n\r\nThe profound disappointment of the German patriots at the downfall of their\r\npolitical ideals found its counterpart in German letters and music. Georg\r\nGottfried Gervinus, the historian, who had taken so active a part in the\r\nattempted reorganization of Germany, turned from history to purely literary\r\nstudies. It was then that he wrote his celebrated \"Study of Shakespeare.\"\r\nRichard Wagner, who had escaped arrest only by fleeing from Dresden, gave\r\nup active composition to write pamphlets and essays, and published his\r\nremarkable essay on \"The Revolution and the Fine Arts.\" In the meanwhile,\r\nFranz Liszt at Weimar brought out Wagner's new operas \"Lohengrin\" and\r\n\"Tannhäuser.\" Nicolas Lenau, the most melodious of the German lyric poets\r\nafter Heine, died insane. Lenau, whose true name was Niembsch von\r\nStrehlenau, was a Hungarian by birth. He joined the group of German poets\r\namong whom were Uhland, Gustav Schwab and Count Alexander von Wurtemberg,\r\nwhose literary aspirations were ridiculed by Heine as \"la Romantique\r\ndéfroquée.\" Stimulated by his fellow poet Chamisso's voyage to Bering\r\nStrait, Lenau sought new inspiration in America. On his return he wrote a\r\nnumber of poems on America, which were published under the title of\r\n\"Atlantica.\" In later years Lenau's verses, like those of Leopardi in\r\nItaly, became ever more melancholy, owing partly to inherited tendencies.\r\nIn the early forties the poet's pessimism turned into absolute melancholia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Uhland]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heyse]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Lenau the mantle of German poetry fell upon Uhland. One\r\nof the younger poets, Paul Heyse, at the same time made his first\r\nappearance with the poetic drama \"Francesca da Rimini.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Babism in Persia]\r\n\r\nIn this year, Mirza Ali Mohamad, the great founder of the new Bab religion\r\nin Persia, with his disciples Aka Mohamad Ali and Sayyid Husayn of Yezd,\r\nsuffered martyrdom. Sayyid Husayn recanted under torture, but the Bab and\r\nAka went firmly to the place of execution. Condemned to be shot, the Bab\r\nescaped death by an apparent miracle. The bullets only cut the cords that\r\nheld him bound. He was afterward slain by a soldier. His body was recovered\r\nby his disciples. Thus, in the words of Denison Ross, the Persian scholar,\r\n\"died the great Prophet-Martyr of the Nineteenth Century, at the age of\r\ntwenty-seven, having during a period of six brief years, of which three\r\nwere spent in prison, attracted to his person and won for his faith\r\nthousands of devoted men and women throughout Persia, and having laid the\r\nfoundation to a new religion destined to become a formidable rival to\r\nIslam.\" Further persecution of the Babis during this same year did much to\r\nforward the new religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1851\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon's measures]\r\n\r\nPresident Louis Napoleon's growing mastery of France was revealed early in\r\nthe year. On January 3, as the result of his restrictions of the liberty of\r\nthe press, the Ministry had to resign. The President deprived General\r\nChangarnier, a pronounced Republican, of the command of the Paris garrison,\r\nand dissolved the Assembly, which might have objected to these measures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Spontini]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spontini's career]\r\n\r\nGasparo Spontini, the celebrated Italian composer, died on January 24, at\r\nhis birthplace in Ancona province. Born in 1774, Spontini was intended for\r\nthe priesthood, but while still a lad ran away and took up music. A\r\nsympathetic uncle sent him to the musical conservatory at Naples, where he\r\nstudied under Sala Tritto. Spontini began his career as a dramatic composer\r\nat the opening of the century while acting as orchestral conductor at\r\nPalermo. In 1800 he brought out three operas, and wrote others for Rome and\r\nVenice, so that by the time he went to Paris in 1803 he had sixteen operas\r\nto his credit. His study of Mozart's music served to bring about a complete\r\nchange in his style. Thus his one-act opera \"Milton,\" dedicated to Empress\r\nJosephine, may be regarded as the first of his truly original works.\r\nEmpress Josephine appointed him her chamber composer, and secured a hearing\r\nfor his new opera \"The Vestal,\" produced at the Grand Opera. Napoleon\r\nawarded to him the prize for the best dramatic work of that year. In 1810,\r\nSpontini became the director of the Italian opera, and there staged\r\nMozart's \"Don Giovanni.\" Dismissed in 1812, on charges of financial\r\nirregularity, he was reappointed as court composer by Louis XVIII. His\r\nstage pieces in glorification of the Restoration only achieved a _succès\r\nd'estime_. He was glad to accept an appointment to Berlin as court composer\r\nfor Frederick William III. There he brought out \"Lalla Rookh,\" \"Alcidor,\"\r\nand \"Agnes Hohenstauffen,\" none of which found currency in other cities.\r\nHis overweening conduct gradually made his position at Berlin untenable. He\r\nwas finally driven out by the hostile demonstrations of his audiences, and\r\nretired, in 1841, a broken man. After a few years spent in Paris he\r\nreturned to Italy, where the Pope created him a count. Spontini returned to\r\nhis birthplace of Magolati village only to die.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prussian events]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schleswig-Holstein again]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Metternich returns]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bismarck]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Dreibund]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austrian-Turkish agreement]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, King William IV. at Berlin celebrated the 150th anniversary of\r\nthe Prussian monarchy on January 18. A colossal statue of Frederick the\r\nGreat was made for this occasion by the sculptor Christian Rauch. At the\r\nsame time a further humiliation upon Prussia was inflicted by the military\r\noccupation of Schleswig-Holstein by Austria. The Austrian troops, who came\r\nto put a definite stop to hostilities in those provinces, marched into\r\nSchleswig-Holstein over a pontoon bridge laid by the retreating columns of\r\nthe Prussians. As a concession to outraged German feeling, representatives\r\nfrom Schleswig-Holstein were to be readmitted to the Diet of the Germanic\r\nConfederation. This superannuated Diet met again at Frankfort as in the\r\ndays of the Holy Alliance. Before this a conference of Ministers had been\r\nheld at Dresden, at which Prussia was represented by Baron Lamsikell, while\r\nPrince Felix Schwarzenberg appeared for Austria. With the powerful backing\r\nof Russia, Austria could force the hand of Prussia into reacceptance of the\r\nold order of things. As if to emphasize this, old Prince Metternich made\r\nhis reappearance in Vienna as if nothing had happened. On May 30, the\r\nConfederate Diet met again at Frankfort. Baron Bismarck was appointed as a\r\ndelegate from Prussia. On the day after the opening of the Diet, the\r\nsovereigns of Russia, Austria, and Prussia met at Olmütz to renew the\r\nformer alliance of these countries. A period of reaction set in. The\r\nPrussian Constitution was modified. The Emperor of Austria began to undo\r\nthe reforms granted by the Liberal Constitution of 1849. On August 20, he\r\narrogated to himself absolute powers in a series of Cabinet letters, in\r\nwhich he declared that his Ministers were \"responsible to no other\r\npolitical authority than the throne,\" while the Reichsrath was to be merely\r\n\"considered as the council of the throne.\" Before this the Austrian and\r\nTurkish Governments had come to a settlement respecting Hungarian and\r\nPolish refugees in Turkey. With the exception of Kossuth and seven others\r\nof the foremost leaders of the Hungarian revolution, a so-called amnesty\r\nwas extended to all refugees, provided they did not set foot in Hungary.\r\nAbout this time another popular rising occurred in Bosnia. A Turkish army\r\nwas sent to suppress it, and Austrian troops took up their station on the\r\nfrontier. Many of the exiled Hungarians betook themselves to America.\r\nKossuth first went to England. A magnificent reception awaited him there.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Palmerston rebuked]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boers lose Orange Colony]\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary, in the meanwhile had\r\ncompromised himself with his colleagues in the Cabinet by his independent\r\nthreats of interference in regard to the Hungarian refugees in Turkey.\r\nQueen Victoria sent a letter to Prime Minister Russell containing these\r\nsignificant words: \"The Queen expects to be kept informed by Lord\r\nPalmerston of what passes between him and the foreign Ministers, before\r\nimportant decisions are taken based upon that intercourse; to receive the\r\nforeign despatches in good time; and to have the drafts for her approval\r\nsent to her in sufficient time to make herself acquainted with their\r\ncontents before they be sent off.\" Lord Palmerston replied: \"I have taken a\r\ncopy of this memorandum of the Queen, and will not fail to attend to the\r\ndirections which it contains.\" Some of the most troublesome foreign\r\ncomplications, as often before, first came up for settlement in the\r\nColonial Office. Thus, in March a British force under Sir Harry Smith\r\ndefeated a commando of Boers at Boomplaatz. Other Boer forces were\r\ndispersed. The British flag was hoisted beyond the Orange River and the\r\nannexation of that territory to Great Britain was accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Burmese war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Rangoon]\r\n\r\nIn India, war was renewed with the King of Burma. As usual, the trouble\r\nstarted with complaints of the British merchants at Rangoon calling for the\r\nprotection of their country. Lord Dalhousie sent Commodore Lambert to\r\nRangoon on the \"Fox.\" Lambert seized one of the ships of the Burmese king\r\nlying in the river, promising to restore it on receipt of ten thousand\r\nrupees as compensation for the injured merchants. In reply the Burmese\r\nopened fire on the \"Fox.\" Now all Burmese ports were declared in a state of\r\nblockade. Lord Dalhousie sent nineteen steamers and 6,000 men to Rangoon\r\nunder General Godwin. Rangoon was captured after a heavy cannonade. The\r\nthree terraces of the great Pagoda there were carried by storm, and the\r\nBritish flag hoisted over the golden dome of the sacred Pagoda. The capture\r\nof Rangoon was followed by that of Bassie on the Irawaddy, and Prome. The\r\nwhole of Pegu was annexed to the British Empire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gold found in Australia]\r\n\r\nIn Australia great excitement was created by the discovery of gold in\r\nvarious places. As early as February, gold was found in New South Wales by\r\nreturned gold seekers from California. A great number of immigrants rushed\r\ninto that province. In July, a squatter on Meroo Creek found a mass of\r\nvirgin gold weighing above a hundred pounds. Thereupon the famous gold\r\nfields of Ballarat were opened in Victoria. In October, gold discoveries\r\nwere made near Melbourne surpassing all others. As a result of the great\r\ntide of immigration that swept into Victoria that province separated itself\r\nfrom New South Wales. Melbourne became the capital of Victoria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crystal Palace show]\r\n\r\nIn England, throughout the summer, a great international exposition in the\r\nso-called \"Crystal Palace\" erected on Hyde Park attracted visitors from far\r\nand wide. A special ode by Alfred Tennyson was sang at the opening:\r\n\r\n  Uplift a thousand voices full and sweet,\r\n    In this wide hall with earth's invention stored,\r\n    And praise the invisible universal Lord,\r\n  Who lets once more in peace the nations meet,\r\n    Where Science, Art and Labor have outpoured\r\n  Their myriad horns of plenty at our feet.\r\n\r\nThe Exposition was the most ambitious affair of the kind held so far. The\r\nbuilding, which covered an area of nineteen acres, cost about £180,000. The\r\ntotal receipts of the Exposition were more than a half million pounds. At\r\none time it was calculated nearly a hundred thousand visitors were\r\nassembled under its roof. The difficult problem how to place the exhibits\r\nof various countries was settled by awarding the choice places in an\r\narrangement according to Mercator's projection of the map of the world.\r\nEven then Spain refused to be represented at the Exposition unless she were\r\nprovided with an entrance distinct from that of Portugal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil war in Portugal]\r\n\r\nPortugal was scarcely in a condition to share in any exhibition of\r\nindustrial progress. Another outbreak of the persistent conflict between\r\nthe Septembrists and Cabralists broke out in April. An insurrection in\r\nOporto declared for the fugitive Duke of Saldanha. On April 29, he arrived\r\nat Oporto. The movement assumed such threatening proportions that Queen\r\nMaria da Gloria dismissed Count Thomar de Costa Cabral, and made Saldanha\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South American convulsions]\r\n\r\nIn Portugal's former colonial possessions a civil war, no less wearing, was\r\nmaintained. On October 2, General Urquiza of the Argentine Republic, having\r\njoined forces with Brazil and Montevideo, compelled General Oribe to\r\ncapitulate at Montevideo. This ended the nine years' investment of\r\nMontevideo. Later in the year General Urquiza overthrew General Rosas at\r\nMontevideo and proclaimed himself military dictator. In Chile, about the\r\nsame time that a violent earthquake wrecked more than four hundred houses\r\nat Valparaiso, a military insurrection broke out under Colonel Ourriola. In\r\na sharp engagement between the government troops and the insurgents\r\nOurriola with three hundred of his followers was killed. The insurrection\r\nwas prolonged by General José Maria de la Cruz. Between four and five\r\nthousand men were killed in the desultory engagements that followed. At\r\nlast the revolt was crushed by the decisive defeat of General Cruz in the\r\nbattle of Longamilla.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extension of railways]\r\n\r\nIn China, the threatening Taiping rebellion gathered force. In Siam, the\r\nunusual spectacle was beheld of the simultaneous enthronement of two kings\r\nas rulers of that country. The progress of modern civilization was attested\r\nby the opening of a steam railway in Egypt between the cities of Cairo and\r\nAlexandria. In Russia, too, a straight line of railroad was laid over the\r\nlong stretch between St. Petersburg and Moscow, and work was begun on\r\nothers no less ambitious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American filibusters pardoned]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American yacht victory]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kossuth in America]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Fenimore Cooper]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cooper's novels]\r\n\r\nThe fears of unpleasant complications between the United States and Spain,\r\nby reason of Cuban filibustering expeditions, were allayed by a general\r\npardon extended to the American filibusters on the part of the Queen of\r\nSpain. On August 11, Lopez had landed with more filibusters in Cuba. He was\r\ncaptured shortly after his landing and was shot. The same fate was shared\r\nby his Cuban followers. Only to the American adventurers who accompanied\r\nthe expedition did the Spanish Queen's pardon apply. An event of joyful\r\ninterest to Americans was the victory of the American schooner-yacht\r\n\"America\" over all her English competitors in the yacht races at Cowes on\r\nOctober 22. She carried off the trophy of an international cup, which,\r\nunder the name of the America's Cup, was destined to remain beyond the\r\nreach of English racing yachts throughout the rest of the century. Not long\r\nafter this the visit of two distinguished Europeans excited general\r\ninterest in America. One was Lola Montez, the famous Spanish dancer, whose\r\nrelations with King Louis I. of Bavaria had resulted in the loss of his\r\ncrown. The other was Louis Kossuth, the Hungarian patriot, who had been\r\nbrought from England on an American vessel. His reception in America\r\nsurpassed even that which had been accorded to him in England. During this\r\nsame year in America occurred the deaths of Audubon, the great naturalist;\r\nGallaudet, the benefactor of deaf-mutes, and James Fenimore Cooper, the\r\nnovelist. Cooper was born in Burlington, New Jersey, the son of a wealthy\r\nfather, who settled on the shores of Lake Otsego in New York. After\r\nattending Yale College for three years, Cooper entered the United States\r\nnavy as a common sailor. He was promoted after some time to the rank of\r\nmidshipman and eventually to that of lieutenant. On his marriage in 1811 he\r\nleft the service, and soon began his career as an author. His first novel,\r\n\"Precaution,\" was not promising. In \"The Spy,\" which appeared in 1821, he\r\ngave the first indications of his peculiar originality. It made Cooper's\r\nreputation as an American author. The knowledge that Cooper had acquired in\r\nhis father's estate on the borders of the wilderness and later on the sea\r\nwas turned to account in his many tales of Indian life and sea stories,\r\nwhich took his contemporaries by storm. Most famous among them are:\r\n\"Deerslayer,\" \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" \"Pathfinder,\" \"Pioneers,\"\r\n\"Prairie,\" and the sea tales \"The Pilot\" and \"Red Rover.\" His strictures on\r\nAmerican customs in \"Homeward Bound\" and \"Home as Found\" brought upon him\r\nmuch newspaper abuse. About the time of Cooper's death, Francis Parkman\r\npublished his \"Conspiracy of Pontiac,\" Longfellow his \"Golden Legend,\"\r\nwhile Nathaniel Hawthorne brought out \"The House of the Seven Gables.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tennyson, poet laureate]\r\n\r\nIn England, Alfred Tennyson had been selected as the worthiest successor of\r\nWilliam Wordsworth in the office of Poet Laureate. He showed his\r\nappreciation of the honor by his famous dedication to Queen Victoria in\r\n\"The Keepsake.\"\r\n\r\n  Revered, beloved--O you that hold\r\n    A nobler office upon earth\r\n    Than arms, or power of brain, or birth\r\n  Could give the warrior kings of old,\r\n\r\n  Victoria--since your Royal grace\r\n    To one of less desert allows\r\n    This laurel greener from the brows\r\n  Of him that utter'd nothing base:\r\n\r\n  And should your greatness, and the care\r\n    That yokes with empire, yield you time\r\n    To make demand of modern rhyme\r\n  If aught of ancient worth be there;\r\n\r\n  Then--while a sweeter music wakes,\r\n    And thro' wild March the throstle calls,\r\n    Where all about your palace walls\r\n  The sunlit almond-blossom shakes--\r\n\r\n  Take, Madam, this poor book of song;\r\n    For tho' the faults were thick as dust\r\n    In vacant chambers, I could trust\r\n  Your kindness.

She wrote some half dozen novels and\r\nstories, the best of which was \"Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus.\"\r\nThe weird story, which was written in 1816 in a spirit of friendly rivalry\r\nwith Shelley and Byron, achieved great popularity. This was largely by\r\nreason of the originality of the author's conception of the artificial\r\ncreation of a human monster which came to torment its maker. Mrs. Shelley's\r\nlast book was an account of rambles in Germany and Italy. She also brought\r\nout a careful edition of her husband's complete works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Turner]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Slave Ship\"]\r\n\r\nJoseph M.W. Turner, the most celebrated English artist of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury, died in this same year. Born in 1775, he displayed his artistic\r\ntalents at an early age. At the outset of the Nineteenth Century he\r\nachieved a national reputation by his \"Battle of the Nile,\" but did not\r\nreach the apotheosis of his fame until Ruskin sang his praises. One of his\r\nmost discussed pictures was that of the \"Slave Ship,\" which has in turn\r\nexcited the most scathing ridicule and the most extravagant admiration.\r\nThus George Inness, the American artist, wrote of him: \"Turner's 'Slave\r\nShip' is the most infernal piece of clap-trap ever painted. There is\r\nnothing in it.\" Thackeray confessed with delightful frankness: \"I don't\r\nknow whether it is sublime or ridiculous.\" Mark Twain, the American\r\nhumorist, has voiced both of these views at once, whereas Ruskin has\r\nrecorded:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ruskin's estimate]\r\n\r\n\"I believe if I were reduced to rest Turner's immortality upon any single\r\nwork, I should choose 'The Slave Ship.' Its daring conception, ideal in the\r\nhighest sense of the word, is based on the purest truth, and wrought out\r\nwith the concentrated knowledge of a life. Its color is absolutely perfect,\r\nnot one false or morbid hue in any part or line, and so modulated that\r\nevery square inch of canvas is a perfect composition; its drawing as\r\naccurate as fearless; the ship buoyant, bending, and full of motion; its\r\ntones as true as they are wonderful; and the whole picture dedicated to the\r\nmost sublime of subjects and impressions (completing thus the perfect\r\nsystem of all truth, which we have shown to be formed by Turner's\r\nworks)--the power, majesty, and deathfulness of the open, deep, illimitable\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some Turner prices]\r\n\r\nThe picture, having first been acquired by Ruskin, finally went to America.\r\nAbout this time Turner's canvases began to command fabulous prices. \"Van\r\nGoyen Looking for a Subject,\" sold in 1833 for a few hundred pounds, was\r\nresold in London thirty years later for 2,510 guineas. At a Turner sale in\r\n1878 hitherto unsold canvases and unfinished sketches brought over £73,000,\r\nor about $365,000. Over a hundred of Turner's paintings and as many\r\nsketches and drawings, dating from 1790 to 1850, are now in the National\r\nGallery of London.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Sebastiani]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corsican diplomacy]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Soult]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soult's early successes]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Peer of France]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foremost soldier of Empire]\r\n\r\nIn France, Marshal Horace François Sebastiani, one of the favorites of\r\nNapoleon the Great, died on July 21 at Paris. Sebastiani was a Corsican\r\nlike Napoleon. He was identified with his great countryman's career from\r\nbeginning to end. A soldier of fortune, like his illustrious chief, he\r\ndistinguished himself chiefly by his Machiavellian talents for diplomacy.\r\nIt was he who stirred up Napoleon's first war with England by his famous\r\nmission to the East to lay bare England's weakness in that quarter. After\r\nthis, Sebastiani's name figured in many confidential missions. By his\r\nmachinations at Constantinople, at one time he embroiled both England and\r\nRussia with Turkey, when such a diversion came most welcome to Napoleon,\r\nwho was then fighting on the frontiers of Poland. On the downfall of\r\nNapoleon, Sebastiani was temporarily intrusted with the management of\r\naffairs at Paris. His conduct at this time as at all others laid him open\r\nto charges of double dealing and treachery. Napoleon showed his\r\nappreciation of Sebastiani's services by remembering him in his will. The\r\nfamous old marshal's death gave to Prince Louis Napoleon a welcome\r\nopportunity to recall the lost glories of the First Empire. A still better\r\nchance was presently afforded. For, soon after Sebastiani, Marshal Soult\r\ndied at château St. Amans, on November 26, in his eighty-second year. The\r\ndeath of this distinguished Marshal-General of France served to recall some\r\nof the brightest glories of Napoleonic days. Born in 1769 at St.\r\nAmans-la-Bastide, Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult joined the royal army of\r\nFrance at the age of sixteen. He served as a sous-lieutenant under Marshals\r\nLukner and Ustine, and so distinguished himself that he soon won his steps\r\nand was attached as adjutant-general to Marshal Lefebvre's staff. As a\r\nbrigadier-general he turned the tide of victory at the battle of Fluress.\r\nAfter this he was intrusted with the command of a division, and took part\r\nin all the campaigns in Germany, and through the Swiss and Italian\r\ncampaigns waged by Massèna. In a sortie from Genoa he was taken prisoner.\r\nSet at liberty after the battle of Marengo, he returned to France at the\r\npeace of Amiens, and was made one of the four colonels of the guard of the\r\nconsuls. Napoleon Bonaparte, though by no means fond of Soult, was quick to\r\ndetect his great talents as a soldier. After this a prominent part was\r\nassigned to Soult in all of Napoleon's campaigns. He was one of the first\r\nof the generals selected for the new rank of marshal in 1804, and was the\r\nfirst of the marshals to be advanced to the dignity of a peer of France. In\r\n1805, Soult led the main column of the Grand Army, which gained the\r\nAustrian rear, and thus brought about the disastrous capitulation of Ulm.\r\nOn the field of Austerlitz he was charged with the execution of the\r\nbrilliant manoeuvre which decided the fate of that battle. His share in\r\nthe battle of Jena was scarcely less distinguished. After this victory,\r\nSoult defeated Kalkreuth, captured Magdeburg, and put to flight Blücher and\r\nLestocq. On the bloody field of Eylau, Soult's ardor helped to secure the\r\nsemblance of victory for France. In 1808 he was sent to secure the French\r\nconquest of Spain. He defeated the Spaniards at Manuessa and fought the\r\nbattle at Coruña where Sir John Moore lost his life. The English army\r\nhaving fled, Soult overran Galicia and the north of Portugal, where he\r\nstormed Oporto. On the landing of Wellington he retreated before that\r\ncommander into Spain, but after the battle of Talavera once more drove the\r\nSpaniards and English before him into Portugal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Last stand at Toulouse]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minister of war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marshal-General of France]\r\n\r\nAfter the loss of Badajoz and Ciudad Rodrigo, Soult was recalled to aid\r\nNapoleon in Germany after the catastrophe of Moscow. He was the Emperor's\r\nchief-of-staff in the battles of Luetzen and Bautzen. On Wellington's\r\ninvasion of France, Soult was sent against him. Marching through the passes\r\nof the Pyrenees, he succeeded in inflicting great losses on the English.\r\nHis attempts to secure Pampeluna and San Sebastian having failed, Soult was\r\ncompelled to face Wellington on the soil of France. His dispirited troops\r\nwere driven back at Toulouse, where he held his ground tenaciously until\r\nthe allies had lost 5,000 men. At the Peace of Paris he signed a separate\r\nsuspension of arms, and was rewarded for this by Louis XVIII. with the\r\ncross of St. Louis and the portfolio of the Ministry of War, but during the\r\nHundred Days he declared for Napoleon, and once more served as his\r\nchief-of-staff at Waterloo. On his return from exile in 1819 his marshal's\r\nbaton was restored to him. Charles X. also confirmed him in his rank as\r\npeer. Louis Philippe twice made him Minister of War. At the coronation of\r\nQueen Victoria in 1838, Soult was elected to represent France. When he\r\nretired into private life, nearly ten years later, the King revived for him\r\nthe ancient dignity of Marshal-General of France.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon's aspirations]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maupas]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emphatic disavowals]\r\n\r\nBy the time of Marshal Soult's death, the storm that arose over Louis\r\nNapoleon's abrupt removal of Changarnier had been suppressed with a firm\r\nhand. The majority in the Assembly who voted for a revision of the\r\nConstitution was found to be ninety-seven less than the three-fourths\r\nrequired, and all further opposition of the Assembly against Louis\r\nNapoleon's measures was denounced as factious. Maupas, the obsequious Chief\r\nof Police, discovered dangerous plots against the government and against\r\nthe person of the President. Fears of possible Napoleonic aspirations had\r\nbeen silenced by Louis Napoleon's energetic protests. He himself stated\r\npublicly: \"They think that I wish to revive Napoleon. What could I revive\r\nof Napoleon? One sole thing--a crime. I am not a genius--so I cannot copy\r\nNapoleon; but I am an honest man--so I will imitate Washington. My name,\r\nthe name of Bonaparte, will be inscribed on two pages in the history of\r\nFrance. On the first there will be crime and glory; on the second propriety\r\nand honor. And the second, perhaps, will be worth the first. Why? Because,\r\nif Napoleon is the greater, Washington is a better man. Between the guilty\r\nhero and the good citizen I choose the good citizen. Such is my ambition.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A last denial]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Coup d'État]\r\n\r\nLater, after a caricaturist had been imprisoned and fined for depicting\r\nLouis Bonaparte in the act of shooting at the French Constitution as a\r\ntarget, Morigny, Minister of the Interior, declared in the Council that \"a\r\nguardian of public power should never so violate the law, as otherwise he\r\nwould be--\" \"A dishonest man,\" interposed President Napoleon. Such was the\r\nsituation on the eve of December 2. As Victor Hugo put it, in the opening\r\nchapter of his \"History of a Crime\": \"People had long suspected Louis\r\nBonaparte; but long continued suspicion blunts the intellect and it wears\r\nitself out by fruitless alarms.\" On December 1, the session of the Assembly\r\nwas devoted to a discussion on municipal law. It terminated with a peaceful\r\ntribunal vote. Prince Louis Napoleon held an informal reception at the\r\nElysées. During that night, Louis Napoleon, in complicity with the bastard\r\nprinces, De Morny, Valevsky, Saint-Arnaud, Persigny, Maupas and others,\r\nhaving made sure of the commanding officers of the troops on duty, caused\r\nthe arrest before daylight of all the leading Republicans. It was alleged\r\nafterward that Colonel Espinasse, who was in charge of the soldiers\r\nstationed at the Legislative Palace, received 100,000 francs and the\r\npromise of a general's rank for his part in the affair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Boxed up\"]\r\n\r\nAt the stroke of five in the morning, columns of soldiery filed out of all\r\nthe Paris barracks and occupied the commanding positions where barricades\r\nhad been thrown up in former times. At the same time a score of detectives\r\nin closed carriages apprehended the leading members of the Assembly. Among\r\nthem were Cavaignac, Changarnier, Thiers, Bedeau, General Lamorcière, the\r\nActing-Secretary of War, and Charras. The government printing establishment\r\nand all the newspaper offices were occupied by troops. Soldiers were placed\r\nat the side of the printers, who were then ordered to set up a series of\r\nproclamations. Before six in the morning bands of bill stickers, hired for\r\nthe occasion, posted them up all over Paris. At breakfast time, when\r\nsixteen deputies and seventy-eight citizens had been arrested and were held\r\nsecure, the Duke of Morny reported the success of the undertaking to Louis\r\nNapoleon with the two words: \"Boxed up.\" Louis Napoleon hereupon issued the\r\nfollowing decree in the name of the French People:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon's manifesto]\r\n\r\n     \"ARTICLE I.--The National Assembly is dissolved.\r\n\r\n     \"II.--Universal suffrage is re-established. The law of May 31 is\r\n     abrogated.\r\n\r\n     \"III.--The French People are convoked in their electoral districts\r\n     from the 14th December to the 21st December following.\r\n\r\n     \"IV.--The State of Siege is decreed in the district of the first\r\n     Military Division.\r\n\r\n     \"V.--The Council of State is dissolved.\r\n\r\n     \"VI.--The Minister of the Interior is charged with the execution of\r\n     this decree.\r\n\r\n     \"Given at the Palace of the Elysée, 2d December, 1851.\r\n\r\n     \"LOUIS NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n     \"DE MORNY, Minister of the Interior.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Napoleonic address]\r\n\r\nTogether with this decree Louis Napoleon issued this appeal to the people:\r\n\r\n     \"FRENCHMEN! The present situation can last no longer. Every day which\r\n     passes enhances the dangers of the country. The Assembly, which ought\r\n     to be the firmest support of order, has become a focus of\r\n     conspiracies. The patriotism of three hundred of its members has been\r\n     unable to check its fatal tendencies. Instead of making laws in the\r\n     public interest it forges arms for civil war; it attacks the power\r\n     which I hold directly from the People, it encourages all bad passions,\r\n     it compromises the tranquillity of France; I have dissolved it, and I\r\n     constitute the whole People a judge between it and me. The men who\r\n     have ruined two monarchies wish to tie my hands in order to overthrow\r\n     the Republic; my duty is to frustrate their treacherous schemes, to\r\n     maintain the Republic, and to save the Country by appealing to the\r\n     solemn judgment of France.\r\n\r\n     \"Such is my firm conviction. If you share it, declare it by your\r\n     votes. If, on the contrary, you prefer a government without strength,\r\n     Monarchical or Republican, borrowed I know not from what past, or from\r\n     what chimerical future, answer in the negative.\r\n\r\n     \"But if you believe that the cause of which my name is the\r\n     symbol--that is to say, France regenerated by the Revolution of '89,\r\n     and organized by the Emperor, is to be still your own, proclaim it by\r\n     sanctioning the powers which I ask from you.\r\n\r\n     \"Then France and Europe will be preserved from anarchy, obstacles will\r\n     be removed, rivalries will have disappeared, for all will respect, in\r\n     the decision of the People, the decree of Providence.\r\n\r\n     \"Given at the Palace of the Elysée, 2d December,\r\n     1851.          LOUIS NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Second December]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary executions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proscription]\r\n\r\nDuring the same day the Assembly was dissolved by troops. Attempts at\r\npublic protests were roughly suppressed. A few barricades were thrown up,\r\nbut the crowds were quickly dispersed, and those agitators who were caught\r\nwere hurried off to prison. On December 4, the troops were ordered out in\r\nforce, and proceeded to clear the streets. Nearly a thousand persons were\r\nshot during the course of the day. The insurrection was stamped out. A few\r\ndays later, when the National Assembly tried to meet again, a hundred and\r\neighty members were arrested. Then appeared two parallel lists of names.\r\nOne contained the names of those who could be counted on for the purposes\r\nof Prince Napoleon. They were all created members of a consultative\r\ncommittee, which was to sit \"until the reorganization of the legislative\r\nparty.\" The other list contained the names of those who were proscribed\r\nfrom French territory, from Algeria, and from the colonies \"for the sake of\r\npublic safety.\" Among them were Victor Hugo, Thiers, Baune, Laboulaye,\r\nTheodore Bac, and Lamarque. Many hundreds of compromised Republicans fled\r\nbefore they were proscribed. Others were transported across the borders\r\nwithout any publication of the fact. Still others were summarily shot in\r\nthe barrack courtyards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The plebiscite]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreign congratulations]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Palmerston dismissed]\r\n\r\nOn December 21, the result of the so-called popular plebiscite was\r\nannounced. Louis Napoleon had been elected President for ten years by an\r\nalleged vote of 7,473,431 ays against 641,341 nays. He was clothed with\r\nmonarchical power and was authorized to issue a constitution for France.\r\nOutside of France the results of the _coup d'état_ were received with\r\nequanimity. Pope Pius IX. went to a review held by General Gémeau in Rome\r\nand begged him to congratulate Prince Louis Napoleon for him. Lord\r\nPalmerston in London, it was stated, told the French Ambassador that he\r\n\"entirely approved of what had been done, and thought the President of the\r\nFrench fully justified.\" The British Ambassador at Paris was instructed to\r\nmake no change in his relations with the French Government, and to do\r\nnothing that might wear the appearance of English interference. It appeared\r\nthat Lord Palmerston had once more acted on his own initiative. He was\r\nrequested to resign. Before long the dismissed Minister had an opportunity\r\nof showing the government how formidable an adversary he could be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1852\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Louis Napoleon in power]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Empire foreshadowed]\r\n\r\nOn the first day of January, Louis Napoleon was reinstalled as President of\r\nFrance in the Cathedral of Notre Dame. The day was made a public holiday.\r\nOn New Year's Eve the Diplomatic Corps had congratulated Prince Napoleon at\r\nthe Palace of the Tuileries. A few days later some of the more prominent of\r\nthe President's opponents, among them Changarnier and Lamorcière, were\r\nconducted to the Belgian frontier. On January 10, the President banished\r\neighty-three members of the Legislative Assembly. Some six hundred persons\r\nwho had been arrested for resisting the _coup d'état_ at the same time were\r\ntaken to Havre for transportation to Cayenne. On January 14, the new\r\nconstitution was made public. All real powers were vested in the President.\r\nHe had the initiative for all new measures, as well as the veto on\r\ndeliberations of both Senate and Legislative Assembly. The Senators were to\r\nbe appointed by him. The sessions of both bodies were to be held behind\r\nclosed doors. The impotence of the legislators was offset by their princely\r\nsalaries. Senators were to receive 30,000 francs per year, while the\r\nDeputies drew half that sum. The actual sessions of the Legislature were\r\nlimited to three years. The President himself was to draw an annual salary\r\nof 12,000,000 francs. The money for these expenditures was raised by\r\nextraordinary means. A decree on January 22 confiscated all former crown\r\nlands and the estates of the Princes of Orleans. The press was gagged by a\r\ndecree prohibiting the publication of any newspaper without the sanction of\r\nthe government. All liberty poles were chopped down, and the motto of\r\n\"Liberté, Fraternité, Egalité,\" was tabooed. On February 29, the elections\r\nfor the Legislative Assembly were held. The government nominated all the\r\ncandidates, and practically all were elected. Late in March, Prince Louis\r\nNapoleon opened the Senate and Corps Legislatif. His address throughout was\r\ncouched in the language of a monarch. While he conceded the intention of\r\nthe republican reforms to be harmless, he suggested the possibility that he\r\nmight be called upon \"to demand from France in the interest of peace a new\r\ntitle, by which the powers that have been conferred upon me may be\r\nconfirmed once for all.\" A Cabinet was formed of the President's most\r\ndevoted followers, under the nominal leadership of Persigny. One of the\r\nfirst votes of the Legislature, after fixing the President's salary, was a\r\ngrant of 80,000,000 francs for public works wherewith to occupy the\r\nlaboring classes. This done, the President made a triumphal tour of France.\r\nThe government officials saw to it that he received a magnificent welcome\r\nwherever he appeared.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Schwarzenberg]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Buol Schauenstein, Austrian Minister]\r\n\r\nIn the neighboring countries the progress of events in France created less\r\nmisgivings than had the doings of the Republic. In Austria, Emperor\r\nFrancis Joseph further undid the work of the recent revolution by his total\r\nabolition of the rights of trial by jury on January 15. Shortly afterward,\r\nPrince Felix Schwarzenberg, the Prime Minister, died in Vienna. He was a\r\nnephew of Charles Philippe, the famous Prince of Schwarzenberg who\r\nnegotiated the marriage of Napoleon and Marie Louise, and later led the\r\nallied armies against Napoleon. In 1848, Prince Felix Schwarzenberg\r\ncommanded a division in Italy. Later he joined Windischgrätz in the\r\nmilitary occupation of Jena, and soon took charge of the civil\r\nadministration of the empire, in which he continued until his death. He was\r\nsucceeded by Count Buol von Schauenstein.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German affairs]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Danish succession]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German fleet sold]\r\n\r\nThroughout the year the affairs in Germany were tranquil. Shortly after the\r\ndeath of the old King of Hanover, a tariff union was established with\r\nRussia, while a postal and telegraph union was extended to all the German\r\nStates. Early in the year the King of Prussia revived the old Council of\r\nState as it was before 1848. The Constitution underwent new modifications.\r\nIn May, a conference of the great Powers met at London to treat of certain\r\nGerman affairs. An agreement was signed practically assuring the\r\nindependence of the Swiss district of Neuchâtel, which had revolted from\r\nPrussia in 1848. Three days later, on May 8, a protocol was signed\r\nconcerning the Danish succession. This intricate problem continued to vex\r\nthe souls of diplomats. Lord Palmerston, when interrogated about it, said\r\nthat there were only three persons who understood the Danish succession.\r\nOne was the Queen Dowager of Denmark, the second was God Almighty, and the\r\nthird was a German professor, but he had gone mad. While attempting to\r\nsettle the terms of the succession the five great Powers and Sweden signed\r\na treaty guaranteeing the integrity of the Danish monarchy. The throne was\r\ngranted to Christian of Sonderburg-Glücksburg. Christian, Duke of\r\nAugustenburg-Holstein, consented to surrender his rights for a money\r\nconsideration. The treaty was not recognized by the German Confederation,\r\nbut was accepted by Hanover, Saxony and Wurtemberg. In June, Germans had\r\nthe humiliating experience of seeing their fleet, the formation of which\r\nwas undertaken in 1848, sold at public auction. All aspirations for sea\r\npower had been abandoned by the Bund. In July, Prussia's representative at\r\nthe Bund meetings, Baron Bismarck, was sent as envoy to Austria. Through\r\nhis efforts at Vienna the Austrian Government was prevailed upon to join\r\nthe German Zollverein and to sign commercial treaties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Froebel]\r\n\r\nDuring this year in Germany, Friedrich Wilhelm Froebel, the German\r\neducator, died at Marienthal on July 21, in his seventieth year. After an\r\nunsettled and aimless youth, he started teaching, and soon developed a\r\nsystem which has become famous under the name of Kindergarten (children's\r\ngarden). It was intended to convert schooling into play, which, according\r\nto Froebel, is the child's most serious business. The first Kindergarten\r\nwas opened in 1840 at Blankenburg, Prussia. Meeting at first with little\r\nencouragement, it gradually gained a footing in most civilized countries.\r\nFroebel was largely assisted in the propagation of his ideas by the\r\nBaroness Marenholz-Buelow. He was the author of \"Die Menschenerziehung\"\r\n(Human Education) and \"Mutter und Koselieder,\" a book of nursery songs and\r\npictures for children.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Prometheus\" affair]\r\n\r\nIn England, the dismissal of Lord Palmerston left the Foreign Office in an\r\nembarrassing position as regarded Louis Napoleon's government. Other\r\nembarrassments were likewise bequeathed. Thus, on January 10, Lord\r\nPalmerston's successor, Lord Granville, had to disavow to the American\r\nMinister the act of the British man-of-war \"Empress,\" which had fired into\r\nthe American steamer \"Prometheus.\" England offered an apology which was\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Third of February\"]\r\n\r\nThe caustic comments of the English press on French affairs, together with\r\nthe free utterances of Victor Hugo and other French exiles on English soil,\r\ngave great offence to Louis Napoleon. Count Valevski's diplomatic protests\r\nfound support in the British House of Lords. It was then that Alfred\r\nTennyson, undeterred by the supposed reserve of his Poet Laureateship,\r\nwrote the invective lines entitled \"The Third of February.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Henry Esmond\"]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Thackeray brought out his \"History of Henry Esmond,\" a\r\nmasterpiece of English historical fiction. In the dedication to Lord\r\nAshburton, Thackeray thus announced his departure for America. \"My volume\r\nwill reach you when the author is on his voyage to a country where your\r\nname is as well known as here.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transvaal's independence recognized]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, at the Sand River Convention on January 17, the British\r\nvirtually accepted the independence of the Transvaal. In the meanwhile the\r\nfifth war with the Kaffirs was begun by Sir George Cathcart. Incidentally a\r\ncrushing defeat was inflicted on the Basutos at Guerea. Toward the close of\r\nthe year the situation grew so alarming that martial law was proclaimed by\r\nthe Governor of Cape Colony. All inhabitants were bidden to the frontier\r\nfor the defence of the colonies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress of Taiping rebellion]\r\n\r\nIn China, the Taiping rebellion grew ever more threatening. Early in the\r\nyear Tien Wang decided to march out of Kmaysi to invade the vast untouched\r\nprovinces of Central China. He averred that he had \"the divine commission\r\nto possess the Empire as its true sovereign.\" The rebels now became known\r\nas Taipings, after a town of that name in Kwangsi province. Tien Wang began\r\nhis northern march in April. Irritated by the conduct of Tien Wang's\r\nlieutenants, the Triads took a secret departure and made peace with the\r\nImperialists. Their secession put an end to the purpose of attacking Canton\r\nwhich Tien Wang had cherished, and he made an assault on Kweisling. The\r\nImperial Commissioners at that place having beaten them back failed to\r\npursue and conquer them, and they advanced unopposed across the vast\r\nprovince of Hoonan. At Changsha they encountered strong resistance. After a\r\nsiege of eighty days they abandoned the attack and marched northward. They\r\ncaptured Yoochow, which was an important arsenal, and soon afterward\r\nHankow, Manchong and How-Kong were taken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: South American struggles]\r\n\r\nIn the Argentine Republic, the civil war and its consequent upheavals were\r\ncontinued. On February 3, General Urquiza, commanding the combined army of\r\nEntre Rios and Brazil, defeated General Rosas at Monte Cazeros, \"the gate\r\nof Buenos Ayres.\" The city capitulated and the civil war seemed ended.\r\nUrquiza announced himself as provisional dictator. On May 31, he was\r\nelected Provisional President, while Vincente Lopez was elected Governor of\r\nBuenos Ayres. One month later, Urquiza, having won over the army by a\r\nsudden _coup d'état_, seized the reins of government as dictator. His first\r\nmeasure was to acknowledge the independence of Paraguay. In September,\r\nUrquiza's refusal to recognize the political and commercial pre-eminence of\r\nBuenos Ayres produced another revolt. On September 11, the people of Buenos\r\nAyres, under the leadership of Bartholomay Mitré, seceded from the\r\nconfederacy. Urquiza was compelled to leave Buenos Ayres and proceeded to\r\nSanta Fé, where he was acknowledged as President by the thirteen other\r\nprovinces. They bound themselves by a treaty to secure the free navigation\r\nof all rivers flowing into the La Plata. On November 20, the Congress of\r\nthe Confederation met at Santa Fé and invested Urquiza with full powers to\r\nsuppress the revolution in Buenos Ayres. Urquiza's blockade of the city by\r\nsea led to another revolution within the walls of Buenos Ayres. General\r\nPintos assumed charge and Urquiza withdrew.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EXECUTION OF SEPOY REBELS\r\n    Painted by Verestchagin]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Gogol]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Dead Souls\"]\r\n\r\nNicholas Vasilievitch Gogol died on March 4 at Moscow. Born in 1810, at\r\nSoroczince, in the district of Poltava, he began his career as a writer\r\nwith poems and a metrical tragedy, written in the dialect of Little Russia.\r\nTo this period belongs his ballad \"Two Fishes.\" After travelling in\r\nGermany, he was called to a professorship at the patriotic institute of St.\r\nPetersburg, where he wrote his famous prose romances in Greater Russian\r\ndialect. His \"Evenings at a Farm\" admitted him to the literary circles of\r\nthe capital and brought him the friendship of his fellow poet, Pushkin. He\r\nwrote a series of short stories, treating of life in the Russian provinces,\r\nand among the middle class, which were subsequently published in the\r\ncollection of four volumes, entitled \"Mirgorod.\" In 1833, Gogol brought out\r\nhis satirical comedy, \"The Commissioner,\" in which he laid bare the\r\nall-pervading corruption of Russian official life. After prolonged travels\r\nthrough Germany, France, Italy and Palestine, Gogol returned to Russia and\r\nsettled near St. Petersburg. He wrote more short stories and descriptions\r\nof travel, and finally published the incomplete satirical novel, \"Dead\r\nSouls,\" which is the best of his works. In this novel he handled Russian\r\nlife fearlessly, with satirical comments on the weak points of Russian\r\nsociety. It is stated that he finished the story before his death, but\r\nburned the manuscript. When he died he was acknowledged as the best writer\r\nof satirical prose in Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Palmerston's revenge]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earl of Derby Premier]\r\n\r\nOn February 20, Lord Palmerston was enabled to make his former colleagues\r\nin the Cabinet feel his power. Owing to general vague apprehensions that\r\nPrince Louis Napoleon might revive his illustrious namesake's projects\r\nagainst England, a cry had arisen for the strengthening of the national\r\ndefences. To satisfy this demand, Lord John Russell brought in a local\r\nmilitia bill. Lord Palmerston promptly moved an amendment for a general\r\nvolunteer force instead of local militia, thus totally altering the nature\r\nof the bill. The amendment was sustained by a majority of eleven votes.\r\nLord John Russell's Ministry thereupon resigned, and the Earl of Derby was\r\ncalled in. The most conspicuous member of the new Cabinet was Benjamin\r\nDisraeli, who took the portfolio of the Exchequer. Disraeli by this time\r\nhad already achieved popularity as an author. Some idea of his personality\r\nmay be gathered from a contemporary's description of his outward appearance\r\nin those days:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disraeli's appearance]\r\n\r\n\"Usually he wore a slate-colored velvet coat lined with satin, purple\r\ntrousers with a gold band down the outside seam, a scarlet waistcoat, long\r\nlace ruffles falling down to the tips of his fingers, white gloves with\r\nbrilliant rings outside them, and long black ringlets rippling down over\r\nhis shoulders. When he rose in the House, he wore a bottle-green frock\r\ncoat, with a white waistcoat, collarless, and a needless display of gold\r\nchains.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American fisheries dispute]\r\n\r\nThe new Ministry was so distinctly protectionist that the Anti-Corn Law\r\nLeague was reorganized to resume the agitation for free trade. Soon the\r\nperennial troubles with America about the fisheries of Newfoundland broke\r\nout afresh. The new Foreign Secretary, the Earl of Malmesbury, insisted\r\nupon a strict fulfilment of the terms agreed upon in the convention of\r\n1818. Armed vessels were sent to the coast of British North America. The\r\nUnited States likewise sent a war steamer to the disputed fishing-grounds.\r\nMany vessels were boarded for information, but both sides abstained from\r\ngiving serious grounds for complaint.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Franklin Pierce elected]\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the Whigs, encouraged by their success with Taylor,\r\nput forth another military officer, General Scott, as their Presidential\r\ncandidate. At the convention held in Baltimore in June, Webster, Fillmore\r\nand Scott were put in nomination. Fifty-two ballots were cast before Scott\r\nwas nominated. The candidates before the Democratic Convention in Baltimore\r\nwere Buchanan, Cass, Marcy and Douglas. Franklin Pierce was chosen after\r\nmore than forty ballots. The Free Democrats selected John P. Hale and\r\nJulian of Indiana. Pierce carried twenty-seven States, to Scott's four,\r\nreceiving 254 votes to Scott's 42.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Clay]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Webster]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Webster's oratory]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Concord speech]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Webster in Congress]\r\n\r\nHenry Clay died in June. He was a candidate for the Presidency three times.\r\nFew Americans have been more idolized than he. His great success was\r\nlargely due to his manner, which captivated opponents as well as friends.\r\nIn will and fine sense of honor he was as firm and lofty as Jackson or\r\nJefferson. He it was who said that he would \"rather be right than\r\nPresident.\" His death was followed in October by that of his great rival,\r\nDaniel Webster. This great American orator was born in 1782, the son of a\r\nNew England farmer. He was graduated from Dartmouth College, and began the\r\nstudy of law. While reading Vattel, Montesquieu, and Blackstone, he eked\r\nout a humble income as a school teacher. He became associated with\r\nChristopher Gore, a noted lawyer of those days in Boston, and presently\r\nacquired a reputation as an orator. An address delivered at Fryeburg in\r\n1802 furnished the model for his great Concord speech four years later. As\r\na result of the speeches in opposition to Jefferson's and Madison's embargo\r\npolicy against England, Daniel Webster was elected by the Federalists of\r\nNew Hampshire to represent them in the Thirteenth Congress. Henceforth\r\nWebster's stirring addresses were delivered in the national forum of the\r\nUnited States. Pitted against such distinguished speakers as Calhoun and\r\nHenry Clay, he gradually came to be acknowledged the foremost orator of\r\nAmerica. He was at the height of his reputation when he died. His most\r\nlasting achievement, perhaps, was the conclusion of the famous\r\nWebster-Ashburton treaty with England, settling the boundaries between\r\nBritish North America and the United States.\r\n\r\nShortly before Webster's death another orator of world-wide reputation was\r\nheard at Washington. This was Louis Kossuth, the Hungarian exile. On the\r\noccasion of a banquet tendered to him by the American Congress early in the\r\nyear, Kossuth delivered the famous speech in which he compared the Roman\r\nSenate of antiquity to that of the New World.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Junius Brutus Booth]\r\n\r\nJunius Brutus Booth, the great English tragedian, died in America while\r\nreturning from a lucrative tour to California. Booth made his début at\r\nCovent Garden Theatre in London in 1814 as Richard III. His personal\r\nresemblance to the hunchbacked tyrant conformed so well to the traditions\r\nof the stage, and his personification of the character was in other\r\nrespects so striking, that he eclipsed Edmund Keane, then acting at Drury\r\nLane. The rivalry of the two actors grew so intense that Booth was driven\r\nfrom the stage by a serious theatrical riot. In 1821, he made his first\r\nappearance in the United States, again as Richard III., and was received\r\nwith such enthusiasm that he settled permanently at Baltimore. From here he\r\nmade professional excursions to other American cities. Among his most\r\nfamiliar personations were Iago, Hamlet, Shylock, Sir Giles Overreach, and\r\nSir Edmund Mortimer. Over his audiences he ever exercised a wonderful\r\npower. On his death he left two sons, both actors like himself, and both\r\ndestined to make their mark in life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Tom Moore]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moore's American impressions]\r\n\r\nThe death of Thomas Moore, the Irish poet, excited as much attention in\r\nAmerica as it did in England. Born at Dublin in 1779, Tom Moore, as he was\r\nusually called, wrote verses in early youth. Like Pope, he may be said to\r\nhave lisped in numbers. At the age of thirteen he was a contributor to the\r\n\"Anthologia Hibernica.\" After graduating at Trinity College he came to\r\nLondon, and there dedicated his translation of the poems of Anacreon to the\r\nPrince Regent. He became a favorite of fashionable society. Among his\r\npatrons were the Earl of Moira, Lord Holland, the Marquis of Lansdowne, and\r\nother noblemen of the Whig party. He obtained the appointment of Registrar\r\nto the Admiralty in Bermuda, but on arriving there hired a deputy to\r\ndischarge the duties of the office and went on a tour to America. Like some\r\nother famous travellers, he conceived a poor opinion of the American\r\npeople. In commemoration of his trip, Moore brought out \"Epistles, Odes and\r\nother Poems,\" containing many defamatory verses on America. One scurrilous\r\nstanza read:\r\n\r\n  The patriot, fresh from Freedom's councils come,\r\n  Now pleas'd retires to lash his slaves at home;\r\n  Or woo, perhaps, some black Aspasia's charms,\r\n  And dream of freedom in his bondmaid's arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Irish Melodies\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Lalla Rookh\"]\r\n\r\nIn a footnote Moore was careful to explain that this allusion was to the\r\nPresident of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. The poems were roughly\r\nhandled by the \"Edinburgh Review.\" This led to a duel between Moore and\r\nJeffrey--a bloodless encounter, which resulted in a life-long friendship\r\nbetween the two men. The same affair produced a quarrel and Moore's\r\nsubsequent friendship with Byron. Throughout this time Moore brought out\r\nhis charming \"Irish Melodies,\" the most popular of all his productions.\r\nMessrs. Longwin, the publishers, agreed to give him £3,000 for a long poem\r\non an oriental subject. Moore retired to the banks of the Dofe, surrounded\r\nhimself with oriental books, and in three years produced \"Lalla Rookh.\" The\r\nsuccess of this work was beyond the expectations of the publishers. After\r\nachieving this triumph, Moore travelled abroad in the company of the\r\nwealthy poet Rogers, and later of Lord John Russell. At Venice he visited\r\nLord Byron. The affairs of his office in Bermuda next called him there,\r\nafter which he resided in Paris, where he wrote his famous \"Fables for the\r\nHoly Alliance.\" Returning to England, he settled at Bow-wood near\r\nWiltshire, the seat of his life-long friend, Lord Lansdowne. There he spent\r\nhis declining years and died in dotage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Dear Harp of My Country\"]\r\n\r\nTom Moore, while a very popular poet, produced few poems of lasting\r\nquality. Most characteristic of Moore, perhaps, are his lightest verses,\r\nsuch as \"The Time I Lost in Wooing,\" the melodious lines \"Oft, in the\r\nStilly Night,\" or the famous Irish apostrophe:\r\n\r\n  Dear Harp of my Country! in darkness I found thee,\r\n    The cold chain of silence had hung o'er thee long,\r\n  When proudly, my own Island Harp, I unbound thee,\r\n    And gave all thy chords to light, freedom, and song!\r\n\r\n  The warm lay of love and the light note of gladness\r\n    Have waken'd thy fondest, thy liveliest thrill;\r\n  But, so oft hast thou echoed the deep sigh of sadness,\r\n    That ev'n in thy mirth it will steal from thee still.\r\n\r\n  Dear Harp of my Country! farewell to thy numbers,\r\n    This sweet wreath of song is the last we shall twine!\r\n  Go, sleep with the sunshine of Fame on thy slumbers,\r\n    Till touch'd by some hand less unworthy than mine;\r\n\r\n  If the pulse of the patriot, soldier, or lover,\r\n    Have throbb'd at our lay, 'tis thy glory alone;\r\n  I was but as the wind, passing heedlessly over,\r\n    And all the wild sweetness I wak'd was thine own.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Wellington]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellesley's campaigns]\r\n\r\nThe death of Wellington, on September 14, was felt as a national loss in\r\nEngland. The Iron Duke died in his eighty-fourth year, having grown more\r\nand more infirm in his last few years. Arthur Wellesley, or Wesley, as the\r\nname was originally written, singularly enough received his first military\r\neducation in France, under the direction of Pignorel, the celebrated\r\nengineer. He saw his first active service with the Duke of York's\r\ndisastrous expedition to the Netherlands in 1794. There he gained his\r\ncolonelcy. After his transfer to India he served under his elder brother,\r\nMarquis Wellesley, and gained the brilliant victories of Assaye and of\r\nArgaum. On his return from India he was appointed Secretary of Ireland, and\r\nthere established the celebrated police force which later served as a model\r\nfor that of London. In 1807, he took part in the expedition against\r\nCopenhagen, and after the death of Sir John Moore was sent to Portugal,\r\nwhere he won the battles of Rolica, Vimiera, the brilliant passage of the\r\nDouro, and the hard-fought field of Talavera. The battle of Busaco, the\r\nstorming of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, the victories of Salamanca and\r\nVittoria, followed, and the Viscount successively became Earl and Marquis\r\nof Wellington, and a grant from Parliament subsequently placed him in\r\npossession of the domain of Strathfieldsaye. The capture of Pampeluna and\r\nSt. Sebastian, and the defeat of the French in the passes of the Pyrenees,\r\nenabled him to plant the British ensign on French ground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington's funeral]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tennyson's Ode]\r\n\r\nThe concluding triumphs of Orthes and Toulouse were succeeded by the\r\ngeneral peace and by his own promotion to a dukedom, the baton of a\r\nfield-marshal having previously been conferred upon him for his victory at\r\nSalamanca. In 1814, the Duke of Wellington was appointed Ambassador to\r\nFrance, and proceeded in that capacity to the Congress of Vienna. While\r\nthere, the return of Napoleon from Elba once more called him to the field;\r\nand on June 18, 1815, he gained his greatest triumph at Waterloo. After\r\nthis Wellington served his country in the capacity of a diplomat, as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the army, Prime Minister, and again as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the army. A public funeral was of course decreed.\r\nWilliam Gladstone pronounced the funeral oration in Parliament. In the\r\nprocession that followed Wellington's bier, British soldiers of every arm\r\nand of every regiment of the service for the first time marched together.\r\nFrom Grosvenor Gate to St. Paul's Cathedral there was not a foot of\r\nunoccupied ground. An unbroken silence was maintained as the procession\r\nmoved slowly by to the mausoleum where the remains of England's great\r\nwarrior were to be placed side by side with those of Nelson. Alfred\r\nTennyson recited his famous ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington:\r\n\r\n  Bury the Great Duke\r\n  With an empire's lamentation,\r\n  Let us bury the Great Duke\r\n  To the noise of the mourning of a mighty nation,\r\n  Mourning when their leaders fall,\r\n  Warriors carry the warrior's pall,\r\n  And sorrow darkens hamlet and hall.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Lead out the pageant: sad and slow,\r\n  As fits an universal woe,\r\n  Let the long, long procession go,\r\n  And let the sorrowing crowd about it grow,\r\n  And let the mournful martial music blow;\r\n  The last great Englishman is low.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disraeli and Gladstone]\r\n\r\nA new Parliament assembled in November. The result of the elections left\r\nthe government in as hopeless a minority as before. An elaborate system of\r\nfinance brought forward by Disraeli was rudely handled by Gladstone. The\r\ndebate was one of the fiercest ever heard in Parliament. The excitement on\r\nboth sides was intense. Disraeli, animated by the power of desperation, was\r\nin a mood neither to give nor to take quarter. He assailed Sir Charles\r\nWood, the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, with a vehemence which more\r\nthan once went to the very limits of Parliamentary decorum. The House had\r\nnot heard the concluding word of Disraeli's bitter and impassioned speech,\r\nwhen Gladstone leaped to his feet to answer him. The Government was\r\ndefeated. Disraeli took his defeat with characteristic composure. The\r\nmorning was cold and wet. \"It will be an unpleasant day for going to\r\nOsborne,\" he quietly remarked to a friend as they went down Westminster\r\nHall together and looked out into the dreary street. That day, at Osborne,\r\nthe resignation of the Ministry was accepted by the Queen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New English Ministry]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Aberdeen formed a new Ministry including Lord John Russell as\r\nForeign Secretary; Lord Palmerston, Home Secretary; Earl Granville,\r\nPresident of the Council; Gladstone, Chancellor of the Exchequer, while Sir\r\nW. Molesworth, the historian, was Commissioner of Public Works. The Marquis\r\nof Lansdowne occupied a seat in the Cabinet without holding any office. It\r\nwas another Ministry of all the talents. Recent events in France demanded\r\ninstant attention, the more so since the municipal council of London had\r\ntaken upon itself to send an address of congratulation to Louis Napoleon\r\nupon his assumption of the empire. In the end the British Government took\r\nthe same course.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of French Republic]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second Empire]\r\n\r\nIn Paris, the Senate had been reconvened to consider the reinstitution of\r\nthe empire. Within three days a _senatus consultum_ was ready recommending\r\nthe desired change to another plebiscite. Every one of the Senators, so the\r\nParisians suggested, had 30,000 francs' worth of reasons for advocating the\r\nchange. The formality of a plebiscite was accomplished by November 21. The\r\ngovernment functionaries reported 7,854,189 yeas against 253,145 nays. On\r\nthe anniversary of his _coup d'état_ of the previous year, Louis Napoleon\r\ntook the title of Napoleon III., by the grace of God and the will of the\r\nnation, Emperor of the French. The title was made hereditary. In vain did\r\nthe Count of Chambord voice the protest of the Royalists, and Victor Hugo,\r\nin his exile on the Island of Jersey, that of the Republicans. France was\r\nonce more under imperial rule, and seemed content to remain so. About this\r\ntime the great Crédit Mobilier was established as a joint-stock company by\r\nIsaac and Emile Pereire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Holy Sepulchre controversy]\r\n\r\nOutside of France, Louis Napoleon's second _coup d'état_ created little\r\nstir. Only Emperor Nicholas of Russia refused to recognize Louis Napoleon\r\nas a full-fledged monarch. An ecclesiastical dispute concerning the\r\nguardianship of the holy places in Palestine threatened to make trouble\r\nbetween France and Russia. In the end the Sultan was prevailed upon to sign\r\na treaty confirming the sole custody of the Holy Sepulchre to the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1853\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Empress Eugénie]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Royalists reconciled]\r\n\r\nOn January 30, Louis Napoleon married Eugénie Marie de Montijo de Guzman, a\r\nSpanish beauty. Raised to the rank of Empress, this ambitious lady at once\r\nbecame a leader of fashion. The Czar of Russia, acting in conformity with\r\nthe sovereigns of Austria and Prussia, finally consented to acknowledge\r\nNapoleon III. as Emperor of the French, and Great Britain followed.\r\nStrengthened by this outward recognition, Louis Napoleon deemed it safe to\r\nextend an amnesty to some 4,500 political prisoners and Republican exiles.\r\nOn February 5, however, General Saint-Priest, with many other Royalists,\r\nwas secretly arrested on charges of communicating with the Comte de\r\nChambord and of sending false news to foreign newspapers. Not long\r\nafterward a bill was passed restoring capital punishment for attempts to\r\nsubvert the imperial government and for plots against the life of the\r\nEmperor. On the recognition of the Empire by Great Britain, application was\r\nmade to the English Government for a surrender of the Great Napoleon's last\r\ntestament. The request was granted. Louis Napoleon thereupon undertook to\r\ncarry out his famous uncle's bequests. Under the stress of adversity, the\r\ntwo branches of the Bourbon family became reconciled to each other. The\r\nDuke de Nemours, on behalf of the House of Orleans, made his peace with the\r\nComte de Chambord. Henceforth, the Count of Paris was recognized by the\r\nRoyalists of France as the rightful pretender to the crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gervinus' State trial]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Tieck]\r\n\r\nIn Germany, reactionary measures of repression were still in order. An\r\nalleged democratic conspiracy was unearthed at Berlin in March, and another\r\nin April. In Baden, Georg Gervinus, the historian, on charges of high\r\ntreason for writing his \"Introduction to the History of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury,\" was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment, and his book was\r\nordered to be burned. The sentence of imprisonment, however, was not\r\nexecuted. On April 28, Ludwig Tieck, the great German Shakespearian scholar\r\nand romantic poet, died at Berlin. Born in 1778 at Berlin, he entered into\r\nliterary activity at the opening of the Nineteenth Century, and joined the\r\nenlightened circle of Weimar. There he issued his great collection of\r\nGerman medieval romances, and of the works of the Minnesingers. It was he\r\nwho drew Goethe into the study of Shakespeare, and who persuaded Henry\r\nSteffens, the Norwegian philosopher, to try his hand at purely literary\r\nproductions. Together with Schlegel he was the greatest German exponent of\r\nthe works of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reaction in Italy]\r\n\r\nIn Italy, likewise, severe measures of reaction were inflicted on the\r\npeople of the governments of Austria, Naples and some of the petty\r\nprincipalities. In Tuscany, the reading of the Bible was prohibited. In\r\nFebruary, a revolt at Milan, instigated by Mazzini, was ruthlessly put\r\ndown. A few months later a revolutionary plot was revealed at Rome. Some\r\nhundred and fifty conspirators were thrown into prison. As heretofore,\r\nGaribaldi figured in these movements. In Sardinia alone, under the\r\nenlightened Ministry of Count Cavour, the liberal movement for united Italy\r\nwas encouraged. The Pope's hostile attitude was resented by the passage of\r\nanti-clerical measures in Sardinia. Thus at first ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction was abolished, and later bills were proposed for the\r\nsuppression of convents and for the ultimate withdrawal of all State\r\nsupport from the clergy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tommaso Grossi]\r\n\r\nIn October, while the conspiracy trials were still in full prosecution at\r\nMilan, Tommaso Grossi, the Italian romantic poet, died in that city. Grossi\r\nwas born at Belland, on Lake Como, in 1791, and at an early age won\r\ndistinction by a patriotic satire against Austrian rule in northern Italy.\r\nIn 1817 he published \"La Fuggitiva,\" a love story of the French wars, which\r\nfound great favor. Inspired by his intercourse with Manzoni, a few years\r\nlater he wrote \"Ildegonda,\" a romantic poem treating of the times of\r\nchivalry and cloister life. This poem won a great success. Less happy was\r\nhis attempt to rival Tasso with an epic poem in fifteen cantos on the\r\nCrusades. Among his prose tales, the most lasting in interest are the\r\nhistorical novel \"Marco Visconti\" and the idyl \"Ulrico e Lida.\" Of his\r\nlyric songs, \"La Rondiella\" achieved the greatest popularity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gustave Courbet]\r\n\r\nGustave Courbet, the French originator of realism in painting, the author\r\nof \"Le Beau c'est le Laid,\" the man who claimed that all search for the\r\nbeautiful or ideality in art was a gross error, this year exhibited his\r\n\"Women Bathing,\" and again created a stir on the exhibition of his \"Funeral\r\nat Ornans\" and his \"Drunken Peasants at Flagny.\" This early exponent of\r\nrealism in its most radical form, despite his taste for vulgar types,\r\nshowed such strength of technique that his landscapes were accepted almost\r\nat once as masterpieces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: International expositions]\r\n\r\nIn England, a period of great prosperity had set in, notwithstanding\r\nseveral great labor strikes, among them that of the London cabmen, and of\r\nmany thousands of operatives at Stockport and Preston. The success of the\r\nCrystal Palace Exhibition had been such that another great Industrial\r\nExhibition was held at Dublin. It was made the occasion of Queen Victoria's\r\nsecond visit to Ireland. International expositions were likewise held at\r\nBerlin and in New York.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: President Pierce inaugurated]\r\n\r\nThe change of Administration in the United States of North America gave a\r\nnew tone to affairs there, and incidentally brought America into closer\r\ntouch with the East. Congress had counted the electoral vote on February 9,\r\ngiving to Pierce 254 and 42 to Scott. Franklin Pierce was forty-nine years\r\nof age when he became President, and was the youngest man who had been\r\nelected to that office. During the Mexican war he had fought with credit\r\nunder Scott. William L. Marcy became Secretary of State, and Guthrie,\r\nMcClelland, Jefferson Davis, Dobbin, Campbell and Cushing completed the\r\nCabinet. It was said that Pierce came into office with no bitter\r\nopposition and went out with none. In his inaugural message he spoke with\r\ndoubt concerning his own powers. In truth, he proved himself the tool of\r\ndifferent managers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kane's Arctic voyage]\r\n\r\nThe American Government also assisted Grinnell in fitting out a second\r\nexpedition to the Arctic under charge of Dr. Kane, who was surgeon and\r\nnaturalist of the former expedition. The ships were frozen fast on the\r\nshores of Greenland. Kane's crew, without waiting for relief, set out to\r\nreturn in open boats, and after a voyage of 1,300 miles reached a Danish\r\nsettlement in Greenland, where a relief expedition met them. They reached\r\nNew York on October 11, 1855, where they were welcomed as men risen from\r\nthe dead. They brought no news concerning Sir John Franklin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Arago]\r\n\r\nDominique François Arago died on October 2, at the age of sixty-seven.\r\nScientists remember him chiefly for his experiments and discoveries in\r\nmagnetism and optics. He was one of the few men who championed Fresnel\r\nduring the controversy which raged at the time when the undulatory theory\r\nof light was first announced. As a popular expounder of scientific facts,\r\nArago had few equals. With Gay-Lussac he was the founder of \"Annales de\r\nChimie et de Physique.\" He was also an active politician, and was a member\r\nof the French Provisional Government of 1848.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The opening of Japan]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Japanese dissensions]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preparing for intrusion]\r\n\r\nA thriving oriental trade had sprung up, fostered partly by the development\r\nof steam navigation and partly by the discovery of gold in California. A\r\nfew years previously a first attempt had been made by the United States\r\nGovernment to break down if possible the system of exclusion kept up by\r\nJapan. Commodore Biddle was despatched with two war vessels. His mission\r\nproved unsatisfactory, and the Commodore was subjected to humiliating\r\nexperiences. Early in 1853, President Fillmore sent Commodore Perry with a\r\nsquadron of four vessels to present a letter from the President of the\r\nUnited States to the Mikado of Japan, asking consent to the negotiation of\r\na treaty of friendship and commerce between the two governments. On July 7,\r\nCommodore Perry's squadron steamed into the harbor of Yeddo. Perry got a\r\nfavorable reception after using his big guns. The President's letter was\r\nleft with the Mikado for the consideration of the Japanese Government,\r\nwhile Perry sailed away, promising to return the following spring. In the\r\nmeanwhile violent upheavals in Japan resulted from the appearance of the\r\nAmerican mission at Yeddo. The appearance of the squadron had long been\r\nanticipated, and was the subject of violent political discussions. Japan at\r\nthat time was threatened with civil war. Two parties were disputing\r\nconcerning the proper successor to the worn-out Shogun, who had hitherto\r\nwielded the powers of the impotent Mikado. The head of one party was Ee\r\nKamong No Kami, the head of the Fudai Daimios. By right he was to be\r\nappointed Regent in case of an emergency. The head of the other party was\r\nthe Prince of Mito, one of the \"three families,\" hereditary Vice-Shogun in\r\nYeddo, and connected by marriage with the family of the Emperor and with\r\nthe wealthiest Daimios. The two parties made the arrival of the American\r\nsquadron a pretext for grasping at the reins of power. Letters were sent to\r\nall the Daimios and Ometkis, requesting their opinions as to the reception\r\nto be given to the Americans. The majority were for resenting any foreign\r\ninterference in the affairs of Japan by force. It was agreed, however, that\r\nopen declaration of war had best be deferred until the comparatively\r\ndefenceless shores of Japan could be strengthened and sea forts could be\r\nerected. Orders were sent to the Daimios to muster the full strength of\r\ntheir retainers and munitions of war, for \"if Japan does not conquer, it\r\nwill be a great disgrace.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taipings capture Nanking]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peking threatened]\r\n\r\nIn China, the Taipings, having captured Kinkiang and Gurking, closely\r\ninvested Nanking. After a fortnight's siege, the city surrendered to an\r\narmed rabble. The Tartar colony of 200,000 threw themselves upon Tien\r\nWang's mercy, but not a hundred of them escaped: \"We killed them all,\" said\r\none of the Taipings; \"we left not a root to sprout from.\" The acquisition\r\nof Nanking, the second city in the empire, made the Taipings a formidable\r\nrival to the Manchus, and Tien Wang became a contestant with Hienfung for\r\nimperial honors. It cut off communication between north and south China.\r\nChinkiangfoo, at the entrance of the Grand Canal, and Yangchow, on the\r\nnorth bank of the river, also fell into their hands. Tien Wang proclaimed\r\nNanking, the old Ming city, his capital. At a council of war it was decided\r\nto provision and fortify Nanking, and then march against Peking. By the\r\nend of May the Taiping army numbered 80,000. They attacked Kaifong and were\r\nrepulsed, but continued their march toward Peking. After crossing the\r\nHoang-ho, they were again repulsed at Hwaiking. Passing on, they defeated a\r\nManchu force in the Sin Simming Pass, and in September added the province\r\nof Pechili, and came to Tsing, twenty miles south of Tien-tsin, less than a\r\nhundred miles from Peking. The fate of the Manchu dynasty trembled in the\r\nbalance. The Mongol levies at last arrived under their great chief,\r\nSankolinsin, and the invaders retired to their fortified camp at Tsinghai\r\nand sent to Tien Wang for succor. At Tsinghai they were closely beleaguered\r\nfor some time to come.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American declaration as to Cuba]\r\n\r\nThe recurrence of American filibustering expeditions to Cuba appeared to\r\nthe governments of England and France as evidence of an American purpose to\r\nsecure Cuba and the West Indian Islands. To avert this, they suggested to\r\nthe United States Government to make a treaty which should secure Cuba to\r\nSpain. The American Government was asked \"to decline now and forever\r\nhereafter all intention to obtain possession of the island of Cuba and to\r\ndiscontinue all such attempts in that direction on the part of any\r\nindividual or power whatever.\" Secretary of State Everett replied that the\r\nquestion affected American and not European policy, coming not properly\r\nwithin the scope of the interference of European Cabinets; that the United\r\nStates did not intend to violate any existing laws; that the American\r\nGovernment claimed the right to act regarding Cuba independently of any\r\nother power, and that it could not view with indifference the fall of Cuba\r\ninto any other hands than those of Spain. This was tantamount to a\r\nreassertion of the Monroe Doctrine. France did not reply to Everett's note,\r\nand the correspondence with the British Foreign Office was scarcely more\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gadsden's Mexican treaty]\r\n\r\nA new treaty with Mexico was negotiated by Gadsden, by which the United\r\nStates secured Marrila Valley, with 44,000 square miles, on the payment of\r\n$10,000,000. This settled the Mexican boundary dispute and averted all\r\ndanger of further war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Koszta episode]\r\n\r\nAnother international complication had arisen with Austria. On June 21,\r\nMartin Koszta, a Hungarian refugee and would-be American citizen,\r\ntravelling under a United States passport, was arrested by the Austrian\r\nconsul at Smyrna. Captain Ingraham of the United States sloop-of-war \"St.\r\nLouis,\" cruising in Turkish waters, hearing of this, put into Smyrna. In\r\naccordance with the recent treaty governing Austrian refugees in Turkey, he\r\ndemanded the surrender of Koszta within eight hours. If the man were not\r\nsurrendered he threatened to land marines and take him by force. It was\r\nfinally agreed to leave Koszta in the hands of the French consul, who\r\npresently released him. Austria issued a circular note to the courts of\r\nEurope protesting against the conduct of Captain Ingraham, and followed\r\nthis up with a formal protest to the government of the United States. The\r\nreply of the American Congress was to vote a medal for Captain Ingraham.\r\nThere the incident closed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austria supports Montenegrins]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia threatens Turkey]\r\n\r\nOther affairs absorbed the interest of Austria's Foreign Minister. A treaty\r\nwas signed with Prussia establishing a virtual defensive and offensive\r\nalliance. At the same time Austria joined the German Zollverein for twelve\r\nyears. When the Montenegrins rose against their Turkish oppressors, Austria\r\nsupported their cause and demanded a redress of their grievances from\r\nTurkey. After protracted negotiations this was granted. The wrongs of the\r\nMontenegrins and other Christian subjects of Turkey were warmly espoused by\r\nRussia. Czar Nicholas, as the pontiff of the Russian-Greek Church, claimed\r\na protectorate over the Greek Christians in Turkey. The pending\r\ndifficulties concerning the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem became part of the\r\ncontroversy. On the pretext of legalizing the predominant position of the\r\nGreek Church as one of the guardians of the Holy Sepulchre, the Czar\r\nassumed a threatening attitude toward Turkey. For a while Lord Stratford\r\nCanning, the British Ambassador at Constantinople, succeeded in mediating\r\nbetween Russia and France. A temporary agreement was effected. At this\r\npoint the appearance of a French fleet in Turkish waters gave great offence\r\nto Russia, making it appear that the concessions to France had been\r\nextorted by a menace. Already Sir Hamilton Seymour, the British Ambassador\r\nat St. Petersburg, had been sounded by the Czar. It was on that occasion\r\nthat Nicholas uttered the historic phrase that \"the sick man was dying,\"\r\nmeaning the Ottoman Empire. It was then, too, that tentative offers were\r\nmade to England to let her take Egypt and the island of Candia, provided\r\nRussia could make herself mistress of the Balkans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: International concern]\r\n\r\nThe traditional aspirations of Russia toward Constantinople were well\r\nunderstood in Europe. With the exception of Prussia, the European Powers,\r\ncontrary to the Czar's expectations, were resolved to preserve the\r\nintegrity of Turkey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austria's timely measures]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Menzikov's mission]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French-English naval demonstration]\r\n\r\nThe Continental Powers diplomatically met the Czar on his own religious\r\nground. Protestant England, on the other hand, with no pilgrims to defend,\r\ncould protest only on the score of preserving the balance of power. A\r\ndeeper reason for British opposition lay in the possible opening of the\r\nBlack Sea to Russian commerce, and the consequent loss of oriental trade to\r\nEnglish merchants. Louis Napoleon, who could hardly begin his imperial\r\nreign in France more auspiciously than by avenging the disasters of his\r\nimmortal uncle and of the Grand Army in Russia, entered the lists as the\r\nchampion of the Roman Catholic Christians of the Orient. Austria, though\r\nshe took no active part against her recent ally, ingeniously frustrated the\r\nplans of the Russian autocrat by bringing the Sultan to terms in his\r\nattempt to crush the insurgent Montenegrins, who had been incited by Russia\r\nto revolt. Thus was Nicholas robbed of his best pretext for impressing his\r\nwill upon Turkey. Chagrined at the triumph of Austria, angered by the\r\ndemands made by the French Ambassador, Marquis de Lavalette, in behalf of\r\nRoman Catholic pilgrims, Nicholas sent his Admiral, Prince Menzikov, as\r\nAmbassador Extraordinary to the Porte. With unusual ostentation Menzikov\r\ngathered the Russian fleet and an army of 30,000 men at Sebastopol, and\r\nthen went alone to Constantinople. He demanded an audience of the Sultan,\r\nand on March 2 appeared before him in a plain overcoat and with boots\r\ncovered with dust. His appearance was in keeping with his mission. In the\r\nname of his master he demanded the protectorate over all Greek Christians.\r\nFailing to attain his end, Menzikov, after a six weeks' stay, delivered a\r\nRussian ultimatum. Late in May he left Constantinople, prophesying his\r\nspeedy reappearance in uniform. Three weeks later the French and English\r\nfleets cast anchor in the entrance to the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians cross Pruth]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cossacks in Danube provinces]\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that a ruler like Nicholas would shrink from war.\r\nOn July 7, he despatched Prince Michael Gortschakov, together with two army\r\ndivisions of 40,000 men each, respectively commanded by Generals Lueders\r\nand Danneberg, across the Pruth, with orders to hold the Danube\r\nprincipalities until the Sultan had granted the Russian demands. Sultan\r\nAbdul Majid, through his grand vizier, Reschid Pasha, issued a firman\r\nrecognizing the rights of his Christian subjects. Upon crossing the Pruth,\r\nthe Russian Commander-in-Chief assured the people of Moldavia and Wallachia\r\nthat their property and persons would not be molested; but the Russian\r\nsoldiers seized the public funds, compelled peasants to give up their\r\ncattle and their grain, and pressed the native militia into the Czar's\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish ultimatum]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russia declares war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oltenizza]\r\n\r\nStill, European diplomats hoped to preserve peace. The Porte was persuaded\r\nnot to regard the invasion of the Danube principalities as a _casus belli_.\r\nThe conference which was held by the representatives of the Powers resulted\r\nin the Viennese mediatory note, by the terms of which the Sultan was to\r\nyield to the Czar, with certain restrictions. Russia's claim of a\r\nprotectorate was utterly ignored. The Czar accepted the conditions imposed,\r\nbut held that the note gave him the desired protectorate by implication. In\r\nEngland, the press fiercely attacked the faint-hearted politicians of the\r\nContinent. Layard, the discoverer of the royal palaces of Nineveh, appeared\r\nas the champion of Turkey in the House of Commons. Still more threatening\r\nwas the attitude of the war party in Constantinople. The Sultan was forced\r\nto reject the note and to prepare for the storm. Hatred of Russia and\r\nreligious fanaticism inspired the Turks with something of the old love of\r\nbattle and lust of conquest. On October 4, an ultimatum was sent to Russia\r\nin which war was threatened if the invaded territory were not forthwith\r\nevacuated. Russia replied with a declaration of war on November 1. The\r\nSultan, for complying with the wishes of his people, was rewarded by the\r\nready payment of heavy war taxes, and by hordes of volunteers flocking to\r\narms. Even Tunis and Egypt placed troops at the disposal of the mother\r\ncountry. In a short time a considerable fighting force was gathered under\r\nOmar Pasha on the south bank of the Danube. On the 4th of November the\r\nriver was crossed and a defeat inflicted on the Russians at Oltenizza.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE BATTLE OF INKERMANN\r\n    Painted by Gustave Doré\r\n    From Carbon Print by Braun, Clement & Co., N.Y.]\r\n\r\nHad the Czar sent his troops into the Balkans immediately after he declared\r\nwar, he might have struck a decisive blow before the Powers could come to\r\nthe assistance of the Turks. But he had pledged himself not to cross the\r\nDanube when he met the Emperor of Austria at Olmütz, and again when he\r\nvisited the King of Prussia in Berlin. Thus he had persuaded them to adopt\r\na policy of neutrality. England and France now promised to give Turkey\r\ntheir armed support if the Czar persisted in his demands. Their fleets\r\nsailed for the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Turkish naval disaster]\r\n\r\nAt Sinope, a Turkish squadron composed of two steamers, two corvettes and\r\nseven frigates rode at anchor under the guns of a small battery. On\r\nNovember 30, the Turks were surprised by a Russian fleet commanded by\r\nAdmiral Nachimov, consisting of six ships of the line and three\r\nsteamers--all vessels of large size, armed with the smooth-bore shell-gun.\r\nFor the first time in naval history the disastrous effect of shell fire on\r\nwooden ships was demonstrated. Only one Turkish steamer escaped to tell the\r\ntale.\r\n\r\nThis blow, dealt beneath the very guns of the allied fleets, had its\r\nimmediate effect. Lord Aberdeen, whose foreign policy was far too mild for\r\nthe taste of most Englishmen, was so bitterly attacked that he resigned.\r\nThe return of Palmerston to the Ministry was the signal for war. In\r\nDecember, the Vienna Conference sent to Nicholas a second note, demanding\r\nthe evacuation of the Danube principalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1854\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opening of Nebraska]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American slavery issue revived]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of Republican Party]\r\n\r\nIn the American Congress, on January 4, Senator Douglas introduced a bill\r\nfor opening the Territory of Nebraska. All land west of Iowa and Missouri\r\nhad been closed against immigrants, so that it was impossible for them to\r\nsecure a farm. By \"Nebraska\" was meant all territory north of Texas\r\nwestward to the Rocky Mountains. On January 23, Douglas introduced his\r\nsecond bill, repealing the provisions of the Missouri Compromise for the\r\nproposed two Territories. This reopened the slavery discussion, which\r\nPresident Pierce six weeks before had declared to be closed forever. At the\r\nEast, Mason and Dixon's line between Pennsylvania and Maryland had been\r\nregarded as separating freedom from slavery. At the West, the parallel of\r\n36° 30', agreed on in 1820, was regarded as the border line. To cross this\r\nboundary, and remove all obstacles against slavery, promptly became the\r\ndetermination of the South. Douglas's bill now declared that the Compromise\r\nof 1850 left the question of slavery to the people within the Territory.\r\nGeneral Cass gave to this doctrine the title of \"Squatter Sovereignty.\" The\r\nbill passed by 113 to 100, and was taken up by the Senate, May 24, and\r\npassed by 35 to 13. President Pierce signed it on May 30. By the\r\nprovisions of the bill, the country in question was to be organized into\r\nthe Territories of Kansas and Nebraska; the slavery question was to be\r\nsettled by the residents; the Supreme Court was to determine the title to\r\nslaves, if appeal was taken from the local courts, and the Fugitive Slave\r\nlaw was to be enforced. The Whig Party was destroyed and the Republican\r\nParty rose in its place. On July 6, a State Convention of all anti-Nebraska\r\ncitizens irrespective of former political affiliations assembled. This\r\nConvention designated the fusion of Whigs, Free Soilers, \"Know Nothings,\"\r\nand Democrats who opposed the extension of slavery, by the name\r\n\"Republicans.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opening of Kansas]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fraudulent elections]\r\n\r\nWithin the three months immediately preceding, treaties had been quietly\r\nmade with a half score of Indian nations in Kansas, by which the greater\r\npart of the soil for 200 miles west was opened. In June, within a few days\r\nafter the act had been passed, hundreds of Missourians crossed into Kansas,\r\ntook up quarter-sections and claimed the right of pre-emption upon the\r\neastern region. In Massachusetts and other Eastern States, societies were\r\nmeanwhile formed for the purpose of making Kansas a free State. All the\r\nNorthwest was eager to furnish squatters. In the East, Eli Thayer organized\r\nimmigration to Kansas. When the country was thrown open to settlement, the\r\ncompany which he had organized took up claims at Lawrence. A population of\r\n8,000 pressed in from the North. Meetings were held in Missouri in the\r\nslave interest, which pledged that State to send men to Kansas and remove\r\nall the Free State immigrants. A bloody election was held in Kansas. The\r\npro-slavery Legislature made it a felony to circulate anti-slavery\r\npublications, or to deny the right to hold slaves. Reeder, the newly\r\nappointed first Governor, arrived. An election was ordered to choose a\r\ndelegate for Congress. Armed Missourians from across the border took\r\npossession of the polls, and by methods of intimidation elected Whitfield,\r\na slave-holding delegate, to Congress. At a second election 13 State\r\nSenators and 26 members of a Lower House were declared elected. For this\r\npurpose 6,320 votes were cast--more than twice the number of legal voters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mexican adjustment]\r\n\r\nForeign affairs for a short while served to distract attention from the\r\nall-engrossing subject. Mexican boundary disputes were further ended by a\r\nrepeal of the obligation of Guadeloupe Hidalgo which required the Mexican\r\nfrontier to be defended against the Indians. For this release the United\r\nStates paid to Mexico $10,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reciprocity with Canada]\r\n\r\nA reciprocity treaty was made with Great Britain which opened to the United\r\nStates all the frontiers of British America except Newfoundland, and gave\r\nto the British the right to share the American fisheries to the 36th\r\nparallel. Commerce in breadstuffs, fish, animals and lumber between the\r\nUnited States and the British provinces was made free. The St. Lawrence and\r\nCanadian Canals were opened to American vessels. All future differences\r\nwere to be settled by arbitration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fremont in California]\r\n\r\nDuring this year news arrived of the safe arrival of Fremont's fifth\r\nexpedition to California. He had crossed the Rocky Mountains at the\r\nsources of the Arkansas and Colorado Rivers, passed through the Mormon\r\nsettlement, and discovered a number of passes. He was chosen the first\r\nUnited States Senator from California, and served for a short term.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cuban filibusters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ostend manifesto]\r\n\r\nOn February 28, the American steamship \"Black Warrior\" was seized in Havana\r\nHarbor, and was confiscated by the Spanish Government on the charge of\r\nfilibustering. The American House of Representatives prepared to suspend\r\nthe neutrality laws between the United States and Spain; but it was finally\r\ndecided to demand an indemnity from Spain. This action gave an interest to\r\nfilibustering operations in Cuba. Expeditions were fitted out, but were\r\nstopped by a proclamation of the President on June 1. The American\r\nrepresentatives at the courts of England, France and Spain, by direction of\r\nthe President, met at Ostend, Belgium, to confer on the best method of\r\nsettling the difficulties of Cuba and obtaining possession of the island.\r\nIn the Ostend Circular these diplomats recommended to the government of the\r\nUnited States that Cuba should be purchased if possible, and if that could\r\nnot be done that it should be taken by force. \"If Spain, actuated by\r\nstubborn pride and a false sense of honor, should refuse to sell Cuba to\r\nthe United States, then by every law, human and divine, we shall be\r\njustified in wresting it from Spain if we possess the power.\" In this\r\nMessrs. Buchanan, Mason and Soule were held to have gone beyond the demands\r\nof public opinion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Course of Taipings]\r\n\r\nIn their camp at Isinghai the Taiping rebels, in China, were closely\r\nbeleaguered through the early part of the year until spring. Their\r\nprovisions then becoming exhausted, they cut their way out and retreated\r\nsouthward. A relieving army from Nanking rescued them from imminent\r\ncapture. They then captured Lintsing, where their headquarters remained for\r\nsome months. During the rest of the year their successes were unimportant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Orange Free State recognized]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, the difficulties of administering the recalcitrant\r\ncommunities of the Boers in the Orange River territory proved such that\r\nduring this year the struggle was abandoned as hopeless by the British\r\nauthorities. The Orange River Free State, organized as an independent\r\nrepublic of Dutch settlers, was recognized as such.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Espartero in Spain]\r\n\r\nOn June 28, another military insurrection broke out near Madrid. General\r\nEspartero assumed charge of the movement. It found favor in Madrid and\r\nBarcelona. Within a fortnight the Ministry was overthrown. On July 19,\r\nBaldomero Espartero was welcomed with great enthusiasm on his return to\r\npower. On the last day of the month the Queen had to present herself on the\r\nbalcony of her palace in Madrid while 3,000 revolutionists from the\r\nbarricades paraded before her. Espartero on his return to power forthwith\r\nconvoked the Cortes to frame a new liberal constitution, a task which was\r\naccomplished before the close of the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Sontag]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, the celebrated operatic singer Henriette Sontag died of cholera.\r\nBorn at Coblenz in 1805, she made an early début, and appeared with\r\nbrilliant success in all the capitals of Europe, where she was recognized\r\nas a worthy rival of Malibran. In 1829 she married Count Rossi, and in the\r\nfollowing year retired from the stage. Twenty years later, in consequence\r\nof the loss of her fortune, she returned to the stage, and it was found\r\nthat her voice had lost none of its power and charm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Crimean war]\r\n\r\nIn the Balkans, the Servians, Bulgarians and the Bosnians, in view of the\r\nmeagre success of Russian arms so far, were disinclined to rise against\r\nTurkey. In Greece, on the other hand, Russian partisans succeeded in\r\ninciting the populace to revolt. From all sides volunteers rushed to the\r\nnorthern frontier. There was even some talk of establishing a new Byzantine\r\nEmpire. King Otto, partly from lack of sympathy, but more through fear of\r\nthe Western Powers, whose ships suddenly appeared at the Piræus, opposed\r\nthe movement. The Greek volunteers who had gathered at the frontier were\r\nordered to disperse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Kalafat]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cetate]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russians cross Danube]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers declare war]\r\n\r\nThe war had so far not fulfilled the expectations of Russia. Not only had\r\nthe Czar's troops been repulsed at Kalafat, despite their greater numbers,\r\nbut they had also been surprised and beaten at Cetate. The respect which\r\nRussia commanded as a great Power had been engendered largely by her\r\nsupposed inexhaustible resources. The Czar was therefore forced to maintain\r\nthe old appearance of strength by recruiting troops throughout his empire\r\nand by intrusting the command of all his men to Prince Paskievitch,\r\nregarded, despite his great age, as the best general of Russia. Operations\r\nwere shifted further to the east, partly to still the apprehensions of\r\nAustria, partly in the hope that more Slavic Christians would join the\r\nRussian army. In the middle of March, Paskievitch crossed the Danube not\r\nfar from the mouth of the Pruth, despite the promises made by the Czar to\r\nPrussia and Austria. The Czar's rejection of a second pacific note from\r\nVienna, together with the breach of the promise given to his fellow\r\nsovereigns, was followed, on March 28, by a formal declaration of war on\r\nthe part of France and England.\r\n\r\nWithout effective resistance on the part of the Turks, General Lueders\r\nseized the Dobrudsha and joined General Schilder before the walls of\r\nSilistria, while Omar Pasha, in the face of a superior Russian force, was\r\ncompelled to retire to the fortress of Shumla. These energetic Russian\r\nmovements spurred the Western Powers to greater activity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Allied troops landed]\r\n\r\nIn April, an English army of 20,000 men under Lord Raglan, together with a\r\nFrench force more than twice as large under the command of Marshal St.\r\nArnaud, distinguished for his deeds in Africa and for his part in Louis\r\nNapoleon's _coup d'état_, landed at Gallipolis. The allies bombarded Odessa\r\non April 22, taking good care, however, not to destroy English property in\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Austrian-Prussian remonstrances]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assault of Silistria]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paskievitch withdraws]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Allies at Varna]\r\n\r\nThe crossing of the Danube by the Russians led Austria and Prussia to form\r\nan offensive and defensive alliance, both agreeing to wage war on the Czar\r\nif he sent his armies across the Balkans or incorporated the Danube\r\nprincipalities. But how little Prussia intended to engage in a struggle\r\nwith the Czar was indicated by the retirement of Bonin, the Minister of\r\nWar, and of Bunsen, the Ambassador to London. Even a tentative offer of\r\nSchleswig and Holstein made by England could not tempt Prussia to forsake\r\nher old confederate. A joint note was sent to St. Petersburg by Austria and\r\nPrussia, demanding the withdrawal of the Russian troops from the invaded\r\nterritory of the Danube. Austria concluded a treaty with the Porte, by the\r\nterms of which she was to seize the Danube principalities, on the borders\r\nof which she had mobilized her troops. Paskievitch's efforts to reduce\r\nSilistria proved fruitless. The courageous example of Mussa Pasha and the\r\nskill of Grach, a Prussian officer of artillery, were more than a match for\r\nthe strategy of the Russian commanding general. The hostile attitude of the\r\nAustrian troops on the frontier of Wallachia and Moldavia, and the landing\r\nof French and English expeditions at Varna, caused Paskievitch, on June 21,\r\nto withdraw his weakened force across the Danube and the Pruth. In the\r\nattempt to reduce Silistria the lives of many Russian soldiers had been\r\nsacrificed. Paskievitch himself was slightly wounded. Eighteen months after\r\nhis defeat he died in Warsaw. Schilder, Mussa and Grach, all mortally\r\nwounded, had been carried off before him. The losses of the allies were\r\nalso serious. An ill-considered march of the French from Varna into the\r\nDobrudsha resulted in the loss of 2,000 men, most of whom succumbed to the\r\ninsufferable heat. In the camp at Varna cholera wrought terrible havoc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ineffectual naval operations]\r\n\r\nUpon the sea the allies were no more successful. An English and French\r\nfleet, under Sir Charles Napier, proceeded to the Baltic Sea for the\r\npurpose of persuading Sweden to join France and England, of reducing the\r\nfortress of Kronstadt, the key to the Russian capital, and of attacking St.\r\nPetersburg itself. Sweden, despite the efforts of the Powers, held aloof\r\nlike Prussia. The walls of Kronstadt defied the ships. Besides the capture\r\nof Bomarsund on August 16, nothing was accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A council of war]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Before Sebastopol]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of the Alma]\r\n\r\nIn Varna, a council of war was held to decide upon the course to be pursued\r\nagainst the Russians. Among others, General Stein, or Ferhat Pasha, as he\r\nwas called after his conversion to Mohammedanism, proposed the landing of\r\ntroops in Asia in order to drive the enemy from the Caucasus. But St.\r\nArnaud, who felt that he had not long to live, and, therefore, wished to\r\nend his career as gloriously as he could, voted for an attack on\r\nSebastopol, the naval port of the Crimea. He was supported by Lord Raglan,\r\nwho desired nothing more fervently than the destruction of the Russian\r\nfleet. So far no less than 15,000 men had perished in the campaign. The\r\nremaining force, composed of 56,000 soldiers, of whom 6,000 were Turks, was\r\nlanded, on September 14, at Eupatoria on the west coast of the peninsula.\r\nTo the south of Eupatoria the sea forms a bay which receives the waters of\r\nthe River Tchernaya, flowing past the ruins of Inkermann. Upon the southern\r\nside is the fortified city of Sebastopol. On the northern side\r\nfortifications had been built to protect the fleet anchored in the bay.\r\nUpon the heights overlooking the river Alma, Prince Menzikov, Governor of\r\nthe Crimea, had stationed his army of 39,000 men with 106 guns. Although\r\nthe heights overhanging the Alma are more than five miles long, the Russian\r\ntroops by which they were defended formed a front of but three miles. This\r\nleft the extreme left of the Russians open to an attack by a ford opposite\r\nthe village of Almatack. Against Menzikov, Marshal St. Arnaud and Lord\r\nRaglan could oppose 63,000 men and 128 guns. The weakness of the undefended\r\nleft flank of the Russian army was discovered from the French ships. St.\r\nArnaud laid his plans accordingly. On the morning of September 20, the\r\nattack was begun. The warships steamed up the river and opened fire on the\r\nenemy. Bosquet, in command of a French division and a Turkish contingent,\r\nwas assigned to attack Menzikov's left. He pushed his way through the\r\nvillage of Almatack and forded the river. His Zouaves nimbly climbed the\r\nheights and reached the feebly defended plateau. Menzikov, busily engaged\r\nin resisting the advance of the English against his right, at first refused\r\nto believe the unwelcome tidings. He endeavored to shift a part of his\r\nforce from right to left. Meantime the English, under Lord Raglan, were\r\nsubjected to so fierce a fire from the Russian main position that they\r\ncould make no headway. They lay passive upon the ground waiting for the\r\nFrench under Canrobert and Louis Napoleon to begin the attack in front, and\r\nthus divert the attention of Menzikov. Weary of their long delay, Lord\r\nRaglan took matters into his own hands. The English infantry rose from the\r\nfield, advanced upon the Russian main position, and, under a hot fire,\r\nstormed the Russian redoubt with dreadful loss. Attacked on the one side by\r\nthe English and on the other by the French, Menzikov was compelled to beat\r\na retreat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War artists and correspondents]\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Alma was one of the first modern engagements described by\r\nspecial war correspondents in the field. The news of the victory was\r\ndespatched to London with a rapidity prophetic of the feats performed by\r\nlatter-day correspondents. Besides the war correspondents, several artists\r\nof note followed the armies of the allies. Among the French painters who\r\nhave perpetuated some of the well-known episodes of the Crimean War were\r\nHorace Vernet, who painted a \"Battle of Alma,\" and Paul Alexandre Protais,\r\na pupil of Desmoulins, who first came into note about that time. Another\r\nartist who made his early reputation in the war of the Crimea was Adolphe\r\nSchreyer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tolstoi]\r\n\r\nOn the Russian side, Count Lyof Tolstoi served at the front, together with\r\nhis namesake and fellow writer, Count Alexander Tolstoi. There he gathered\r\nimpressions for his stories on the siege of Sebastopol, and for his\r\nsubsequent great novel of the Napoleonic invasion, \"War and Peace.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cholera]\r\n\r\nBesides the news of victory, the Crimean War correspondents told of the\r\nsore plight of the English army, of the ravages of cholera, and of the\r\nwretchedly organized hospital system. No preparations had been made for a\r\nvery long campaign. The taking of Sebastopol, it was thought by the\r\nEnglish, would present no grave difficulties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Todleben]\r\n\r\nBut Sebastopol was better prepared to meet an attack than England knew.\r\nTrue it is that early in the war the city might have been taken by a dash\r\nfrom the land and sea. But the chance was now gone. Three days after the\r\ndefeat of Alma, Menzikov sank seven vessels of the Russian Black Sea fleet\r\nin the mouth of the harbor. On all sides the city was strongly fortified in\r\naccordance with the suggestion of Todleben, an ingenious artillery officer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Allies beaten off]\r\n\r\nInstead of moving directly upon Sebastopol the allies first marched to\r\nBalaklava, further to the south, where they would be in constant\r\ncommunication with the ships and could establish a base of supplies. On\r\nOctober 17, an unsuccessful attack was made on Sebastopol.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian success]\r\n\r\nAt dawn on October 25, the Russians crossed the Tchernaya and stole rapidly\r\non until their vanguard had reached a position from which they could\r\ncannonade Canrobert's Hill, the post most distant from the forces of the\r\nallies and nearest the village of Kamara. The main Russian army under\r\nLiprandi soon came up and began to fire upon Canrobert's Hill and the\r\nadjacent works. The English replied with the assistance of a troop of horse\r\nartillery and of a field battery. Two English divisions and two French\r\nbrigades were sent to the aid of the garrison on the hills. The Russians\r\nsucceeded in storming Canrobert's Hill and in capturing the next and\r\nsmaller fortification. Threatened by overwhelming numbers, the troops on\r\nthe remaining hills withdrew.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Balaklava]\r\n\r\nTwo English cavalry brigades--the Light and the Heavy--commanded by Lord\r\nLucan, had been manoeuvring to protect Balaklava. The Light Brigade,\r\nunder Lord Cardigan, faced the Tchernaya; the Heavy Brigade, under\r\nScarlett, was on the Balaklava side of the ridge. A great body of Russian\r\ncavalry swept down the slope upon the Heavy Brigade, and for a moment threw\r\nit into disorder. But Scarlett's men charged the Russians. The two opposing\r\nbodies of cavalry clashed and seemed to melt one within the other. Then the\r\nRussian horsemen yielded, and fled over the ridge whence they had first\r\nappeared five minutes before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The charge of the Light Brigade]\r\n\r\nA disposition on the Russian side to carry off the captured guns induced\r\nLord Raglan to send Lord Lucan an order \"to advance rapidly to the front\r\nand try to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns.\" The order was carried\r\nby Captain Nolan, who found Lucan between his two brigades, with the Light\r\nBrigade beyond Woronzov road. Whose \"front\" was meant Lucan did not know.\r\nNolan conjectured that \"the guns\" in question were those which had retired\r\nwith the retreating Russian cavalry. Already the Russian cavalry had taken\r\nprotection behind its works toward the Tchernaya, and was supported by\r\nLiprandi's troops posted along the Woronzov road, and by Russian guns\r\nbearing on the valley from the ridge and from Fedioukin heights. Nolan,\r\nLord Lucan reported later, insisted that these very guns must be regained.\r\nAlthough Lord Cardigan of the Light Brigade shared Lucan's misgivings he\r\nobeyed the command. With the order, \"The Brigade will advance!\" the famous\r\ncharge of the Six Hundred began. Nolan galloped obliquely across the\r\nBrigade as it started. He was killed by the first shell fired from a\r\nRussian gun. Into the thick of the Russians Cardigan rode with his men. The\r\nforlorn exploit has been immortalized by Alfred Tennyson:\r\n\r\n  Half a league, half a league,\r\n    Half a league onward,\r\n  All in the valley of Death\r\n  Rode the six hundred.\r\n  \"Forward, the Light Brigade!\r\n  Charge for the guns!\" he said:\r\n  Into the valley of Death\r\n    Rode the six hundred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liprandi's victory]\r\n\r\nThe whole Brigade would have been wiped out after the repulse, when the\r\nRussian cavalry rode in pursuit, had not several squadrons of French\r\ncuirassiers ridden to the rescue. The fact that the Russians retained the\r\nhills which they had captured justified Liprandi in claiming the victory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preparing for battle]\r\n\r\nIn November, the French infantry in the Crimea numbered 81,000, the British\r\n16,000, and the Turkish 11,000. Brave as the Moslems undoubtedly were, they\r\nwere not permitted to demonstrate their value in subsequent encounters.\r\nWhile the allies strengthened their batteries and replenished their\r\nmagazines, the Russians likewise fortified their position and gathered\r\nreinforcements. It was a race on both sides for the first delivery of the\r\nattack. On November 4, the allied commanders definitely arranged for a\r\ncannonade and an assault which was to place Sebastopol at their mercy. The\r\nRussians, recognizing their peril, completed the assembly of their forces\r\nto attack the allies and forestall them. In all, Menzikov could oppose\r\n115,000 soldiers to the 65,000 available men of the allies. The Russian\r\ncommander assigned the main attack to General Soimonov with 19,000 infantry\r\nand 38 guns and to General Paulov with 16,000 infantry and 96 guns. The\r\nregiments in the valley of the Tchernaya, formerly commanded by Liprandi,\r\nbut now led by Gortschakov, were \"to support the general attack by drawing\r\nthe enemy's forces toward them.\" The garrison of Sebastopol was to cover\r\nwith its artillery fire the right flank of the attacking force. After\r\neffecting their junction, the two divisions were to place themselves under\r\nGeneral Danneberg's command.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inkermann]\r\n\r\nSoimonov issued under cover of a thick fog from the fortress before dawn on\r\nNovember 5, and to the surprise of the allies began the attack on the\r\nEnglish left. The timely arrival of reinforcements under Buller enabled the\r\nBritish to repel the Russians. Soimonov was left dead on the field. The\r\nattack of Paulov on the right was no more successful. The Russians were\r\nhere repulsed with frightful loss. When Danneberg arrived on the scene he\r\nfound that, with Paulov's battalions on Mount Inkermann and with those of\r\nSoimonov, he could recommence the battle with 19,000 men and 90 guns. Ten\r\nthousand of these men were hurled against the English centre and right by\r\nDanneberg. The carnage was frightful. Between the hostile lines rose a\r\nrampart of fallen men. The Russians would probably have swept away the\r\nBritish by the sheer force of greater numbers, had they not been taken in\r\nthe flank and repulsed by a French regiment which arrived just in time to\r\nsave their English comrades.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A dear victory]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Russian attacking force had been diminished to 6,000 men, it\r\nwas once more resolutely launched against the enemy, this time against the\r\ncentre and left of the allied armies. So impetuous was the assault, that\r\nfor a time the Russians carried all before them. But a simultaneous,\r\nirresistible advance of the French and English not only repulsed the\r\nattacking force, but drove it off the field. Shortly before noon the battle\r\nwas decided. The heavy losses suffered by the Russians enabled the allies\r\nto oppose greater numbers of men against Danneberg's broken battalions and\r\nhis still unused reserve, and to make use of their guns, now for the first\r\ntime superior in number to the Russian ordnance. The battle of Inkermann\r\nclosed with no grand charge on the one side, nor wild flight on the other.\r\nWhen the Russians saw that success was hopeless, they withdrew gradually,\r\nwith no attempt on the part of the wearied allies to convert the repulse\r\ninto a rout. On both sides, men had been ruthlessly sacrificed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crimean horrors]\r\n\r\nInkermann was followed by a gloomy winter. The Black Sea was swept by\r\nterrible storms which destroyed transport ships laden with stores for the\r\narmy. The horses that charged at Balaklava became unfit for service; the\r\nmen who had fought at Inkermann languished in field hospitals. In the\r\nwretchedly organized lazarets at Scutari the sick and wounded died by\r\nscores for lack of proper medical attendance. Shameful frauds were\r\nperpetrated in filling the contracts for preserved meats. With grim humor\r\n\"Punch\" exclaimed: \"One man's preserved meat is another man's poison.\"\r\nAfter the harrowing misery that prevailed in camp had been pictured in the\r\nLondon newspapers, something like system was finally established in the\r\nhospitals by the energy of Miss Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sardinia's offered help]\r\n\r\nBalaklava and Inkermann had a profound effect upon the diplomatic\r\nnegotiation of the Powers. England and France attempted to induce Austria\r\nand Prussia to take arms against the Czar. But Prussia would do nothing\r\nwithout the Confederation; and Austria would do nothing without Prussia.\r\nBuol-Schauenstein, the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, would gladly\r\nhave mediated; but the prospects of success were not rosy. To the annoyance\r\nof Austria, Piedmont, which had maintained its position in Italy despite\r\nAustria, offered to take part in the war. Austria saw that she must now act\r\nquickly if she wished to preserve her European prestige. On December 2, she\r\nsigned a treaty with England and France binding herself not to negotiate\r\nseparately with the Czar; to defend the principalities which she had\r\noccupied in accordance with her compact with Turkey, after their evacuation\r\nby the Russians; and to deliberate with the Powers as to the best course to\r\nbe pursued if the war were not ended by January 1, 1855. The treaty was\r\nintended merely to thwart Piedmont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1855\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crimean war scandals]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliamentary inquiry]\r\n\r\nComplaints of neglect and maladministration in the Crimea waxed ever\r\nlouder. The reports of the war correspondents at the front aroused\r\nindignation in London and Paris. Now the London \"Times\" came out with a\r\nleading article which produced a profound sensation throughout England. The\r\nburden of it was a bitter complaint that \"the noblest army ever sent from\r\nour shores has been sacrificed to the grossest mismanagement. Incompetency,\r\nlethargy, aristocratic hauteur, official indifference, favor, routine,\r\nperverseness and stupidity reign, revel, and riot in the camp before\r\nSebastopol, in the harbor of Balaklava, in the hospitals of Scutari, and\r\nhow much nearer home we do not venture to say. We say it with extremest\r\nreluctance, no one sees or hears anything of the Commander-in-Chief.\r\nOfficers who landed on the 14th of September, and have incessantly been\r\nengaged in all the operations of the siege, are not even acquainted with\r\nthe face of their commander.\" The exposures of the \"Times\" were taken up in\r\nParliament. Already Lord John Russell had urged upon the Earl of Aberdeen\r\nthe necessity of having the War Minister in the House of Commons, and\r\nrecommended that Lord Palmerston should be intrusted with the portfolio of\r\nwar. The Prime Minister refused to recommend the proposed change to the\r\nQueen, on the ground that it would be unfair to the Duke of Newcastle,\r\nagainst whom, he said, no positive defect had been proved. As soon as\r\nParliament assembled on January 25, the opposition moved for a commission\r\nof inquiry \"into the condition of our army before Sebastopol, and into the\r\nconduct of those departments whose duty it has been to minister to the\r\nwants of that army.\" Lord John Russell at once wrote to Lord Aberdeen that\r\nsince this motion could not be resisted, and was sure to involve a censure\r\nof the War Department, he preferred to tender his resignation. The\r\nretirement of the leaders of the House of Commons served to paralyze the\r\ngovernment's resistance. After a debate of two nights the motion for an\r\ninquiry was accepted by 305 against 148 votes. As Mr. Molesworth, who was\r\npresent, wrote:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aberdeen's Ministry defeated]\r\n\r\n\"Never, perhaps, had a government been more decisively defeated. When the\r\nnumbers were announced, the House seemed to be surprised, and almost\r\nstunned by its own act. There was no cheering; but for a few moments a dead\r\nsilence, followed by a burst of derisive laughter. The Ministers of course\r\nresigned.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Palmerston, Premier]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell and Lord Derby, each in turn, tried to form a Ministry,\r\nbut both failed. Lord Palmerston was then called in, and succeeded in\r\nrallying a Cabinet composed largely of the members of the old\r\nAdministration. Thus Lord Granville, Earl Grey, the Duke of Argyll, Lord\r\nClarendon and William E. Gladstone were retained. The chief change was the\r\nappointment of Lord Panmure to take the place of the Duke of Newcastle as\r\nSecretary of War. Lord Panmure, better known as Fox Maule, had already\r\nserved as Minister of War during the six years of Lord Russell's\r\nadministration, and had shown himself thoroughly capable in that post.\r\nCommissions of inquiry were now sent to the Crimea. At the same time\r\ndiplomatic conferences were reopened at Vienna.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cavour's master-stroke]\r\n\r\nThe evident insincerity of Count Buol stirred up a hornet's nest of\r\nindignation. The people of England and France became incensed as they saw\r\nthat Austria showed no inclination to fight. Prussia flatly refused to\r\nassist Austria in any warlike undertaking. Victor Emmanuel of Sardinia took\r\nadvantage of the situation to join the allies. On April 21 he sent 15,000\r\nmen to the Crimea.\r\n\r\nDuring the diplomatic parleys of the Powers, the siege of Sebastopol\r\nwearily dragged along. The commissariat and land-transport systems broke\r\ndown. The armies were weakened by cholera, cold, and starvation.\r\nNegotiations for peace were set on foot by Austria. A conference was opened\r\nat Vienna under promising auspices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Emperor Nicholas]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Four Points]\r\n\r\nCzar Nicholas, with whom the war was a personal grievance, died on March\r\n2--of pulmonary apoplexy, reported the physicians--of bitter disappointment\r\nand despair, claimed his people. His son, Alexander II., peace-loving as he\r\nwas known to be, did not venture to show himself less of a true Russian\r\nthan his father. The Conference proved a failure. Lord John Russell,\r\nEngland's representative, was instructed to insist upon the admission of\r\nTurkey into the Concert of Powers. To secure this end, four principal\r\npoints were to be considered, now famous under the name of the Four\r\nPoints--the fate of the Danube principalities, the free navigation of the\r\nDanube, the limitation of Russian supremacy in the Black Sea, and the\r\npreservation of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. The attempt to limit\r\nRussia's supremacy in the Black Sea was the chief point upon which the\r\nPowers could not agree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes at the front]\r\n\r\nThe operations in the Crimea were vigorously renewed. Lord Raglan died and\r\nwas succeeded by General Simpson. Long before him, old Marshal St. Arnaud\r\nwas carried away by disease. His post was taken by Canrobert, who afterward\r\nresigned in favor of Pelissier. On August 16, the Russians under Liprandi\r\nmade a desperate effort to raise the siege by an attack on the allies. The\r\nassault was made on the French divisions and on the Sardinian contingent.\r\nLiprandi was foiled. Northern Italy was in a delirium of joy when the news\r\ncame that the banner of Piedmont had been carried to victory over a great\r\nPower, side by side with the flag of France. The far-sightedness of\r\nCavour's audacious policy was now fully appreciated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Russian works assaulted]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zouaves storm the Malakov]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British beaten off]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sebastopol yielded to allies]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cost of the great siege]\r\n\r\nThe repulse proved fatal to the Russians. Nearer and nearer the French drew\r\nto the city. But the ingenious Todleben threw up works which also brought\r\nthe Russians closer to the enemy. Sometimes it seemed as if the allies were\r\nthe besieged and not the besiegers. Malakov Tower and the Mamelon battery\r\nin front of it were the scenes of bloody conflicts. Night sorties were made\r\nand repelled. On June 7, the English assaulted the quarries in front of the\r\nRedan, and the French assailed the Mamelon. Both attempts were successful.\r\nOn the 18th, a fierce attack was made on the Redan and the Malakov\r\nbatteries, which resulted in failure, because the French did not act with\r\nsufficient precision. A simultaneous assault was made on the Malakov and\r\nthe Redan on September 5. The French upon capturing the Malakov were to\r\nhoist their flag, and thereby signal to the English when to move against\r\nthe Redan. A brilliant success was won by the Zouaves. Their tricolor waved\r\nover the ramparts fifteen minutes after they had started to scale the steep\r\nheights. The task of the English troops proved more difficult. They were\r\ncompelled to advance under a galling fire, but stormed the parapets despite\r\nthe resistance which they encountered. The attacking force, however, was\r\ntoo small; reinforcements did not come in time, and the remnant of the\r\nparty was compelled to withdraw. It was the story of Balaklava told over\r\nagain with bloody emphasis--the story of splendid courage on the part of\r\nthe men, of wretched generalship on the part of their commanders. After the\r\nattack, the Russians withdrew from the south side of Sebastopol. That\r\nportion of the city had been so thoroughly bombarded that Gortschakov could\r\nno longer hold out. \"It is not Sebastopol that we have left to them, but\r\nthe burning ruins of the town, to which we ourselves set fire,\" wrote the\r\nRussian commander after his brave defence. He could indeed boast that later\r\ngenerations would \"recall with pride\" the great siege and its stirring\r\nevents. The investment had lasted eleven months. It involved the\r\nconstruction of seventy miles of trenches and the employment of 60,000\r\nfascines, 80,000 gabions, and 1,000,000 sandbags. One and one-half million\r\nshells and shot were fired into the town from the cannon of the besiegers.\r\nThe Russian forces in and about Sebastopol numbered 150,000; their losses\r\nsustained in its defence amounted, in killed, wounded and missing, to\r\n90,142. The allied armies numbered 80,650 French, 43,000 English, and\r\n20,000 Turks in January, 1855. The British troops suffered terribly from\r\ndisease. The forty-one English infantry battalions, which embarked\r\noriginally, mustered 36,923, and were reinforced by 27,884. Their strength\r\nat the conclusion of hostilities was 653 less than it was at the beginning.\r\nThe Sardinians suffered proportionately. The wastage, due principally to\r\ndisease, thus amounted to 28,537 men.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BALAKLAVA--\"OUT OF THE MOUTH OF HELL--\"\r\n    Painted by Elizabeth Thompson (Lady Butler)\r\n    Copyright. By permission of Henry Graves & Co., Ltd., London]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The defense of Kars]\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Sebastopol the war may be said to have ended. A brilliant\r\nchapter which had little effect on the Crimean campaign, partly because it\r\noccurred after the fall of Sebastopol, partly because it concerned chiefly\r\nthe Armenians, was the long defence of Kars by Colonel Williams and Wassif\r\nPasha against an overwhelming Russian army under General Muraviev. Williams\r\nsturdily held his ground, bravely repulsed a violent attack in which the\r\nRussians lost over 5,000 men, and surrendered on November 27, with all\r\nthe honors of war, only when starvation stared his little garrison in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First ironclads before Kinburn]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Success of first trial]\r\n\r\nHostilities still continued for a time in the Crimea. The allied fleet was\r\nsent to bombard various sea forts. The most important of these naval\r\noperations from a historical standpoint was the expedition against Kinburn,\r\nfor here it was that the modern ironclad was first tried. On September 5,\r\n1854, Napoleon had ordered the construction of five armored floating\r\nbatteries, which embodied the results obtained in the tests of plating made\r\nbefore the War Ministry's representatives at Vincennes. The ships were of\r\n1,400 tons displacement, were armed with eighteen 50-pounder smoothbores,\r\nand protected by four inches of iron armor. They were the prototypes of the\r\nlater ironclads. Not without some misgivings three of these batteries were\r\nsent to the Crimea to join the allied fleet under Admirals Lyons and Bruat.\r\nThe English squadron consisted of six line-of-battle ships, seventeen\r\nfrigates and sloops, ten gunboats, six mortar-boats and ten transports. The\r\nFrench fleet, besides the three armored batteries mentioned, included four\r\nline-of-battle ships, three corvettes, four despatch boats, twelve gun\r\nboats and five mortar-boats. The combined fleets prepared to attack the\r\nRussian works at Kinburn. On October 18, the bombardment began. The\r\nironclads steamed up to within 800 yards of the main fort; the other ships\r\ntook up positions at distances varying from 1,200 to 2,800 yards. Without\r\nappreciable effect the Russian 32-pound and 18-pound shot and shell\r\ndropped into the sea from the iron plating of the French ships. Whatever\r\ninjury was sustained was caused by the entrance of shot and splinters\r\nthrough the portholes. Unable to withstand the well-directed fire of their\r\ninvulnerable enemy, the Russians hoisted the white flag, after having lost\r\n45 killed and 130 wounded. The allies lost but two killed and had but\r\nforty-five wounded--all on board the armored ships. \"Everything may be\r\nexpected of these formidable engines of war,\" wrote Admiral Bruat in his\r\nreport. The Black Sea was the cradle of the modern ironclad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achievements in Science and Letter]\r\n\r\nAnother achievement of far-reaching consequences was Captain Henry\r\nBessemer's process for manufacturing steel. He took out a patent for his\r\ninvention of forcing air through liquid molten iron. Other inventions of\r\ninterest were Brewster's prismatic stereoscope, Garcia's laryngoscope (a\r\nmirror for examining the throat), and Drummond's light, patented by Captain\r\nThomas Drummond. Captain Robert Le Mesurier M'Clure of the \"Investigator\"\r\nreceived the £5,000 prize for the discovery of the Northwest Passage and\r\nwas knighted. Famous English books of the year were Robert Browning's \"Men\r\nand Women,\" Charles Kingsley's \"Westward Ho!\" and George Henry Lewes' \"Life\r\nof Goethe.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Charlotte Brontë]\r\n\r\nCharlotte Brontë, the novelist, died on the last day of March. She was born\r\nin 1824, the daughter of the Rev. Patrick Brontë of Haworth in Yorkshire.\r\nIn June, 1854, she married her father's curate, the Rev. Archer Bell\r\nNicholls. Under the pseudonym of Currer Bell she published several novels,\r\nin which she displayed great power in the delineation of character. The\r\nmost important of these were \"Shirley,\" \"Villette\" and the celebrated \"Jane\r\nEyre.\" At the same time her sister, Emily Jane, who published under the\r\nname of Ellis Bell, won fame by her novel \"Wuthering Heights.\" She died six\r\nyears earlier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corot]\r\n\r\nThis year Jean-Baptiste Corot, the famous French painter of \"Paysage\r\nIntime,\" and follower and modifier of the new realistic schools under the\r\nlead of Courbet, exhibited his \"Souvenir de Marcoussy,\" which was purchased\r\nlater by Napoleon III.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Rogers]\r\n\r\nSamuel Rogers, the English poet, wit and patron of art, died, on December\r\n18, in his ninety-second year. The son of a banker, he travelled\r\nextensively while a young man, and applied himself to the study of art and\r\nletters. His first published essays and poetry were an \"Ode to\r\nSuperstition\" and \"The Pleasures of Memory.\" The death of his father in\r\n1793 left him in the possession of an ample fortune, and he lost no time in\r\nretiring from active business. In 1798 he published \"The Epistle to a\r\nFriend\" and other poems. During the early part of the Nineteenth Century,\r\nRogers figured in the foremost rank of the literary and artistic society in\r\nLondon, where he went by the name of \"The Banker Bard of St. James's\r\nPlace.\" In 1812 he brought out an epic on \"The Voyage of Columbus,\" which\r\nmet with indifferent success. This was followed by \"Jacqueline\" and \"Human\r\nLife.\" His last and largest publication was his descriptive poem \"Italy,\"\r\nbrought out in 1822. Rogers devoted the rest of his literary life to the\r\npublication of exquisitely illustrated editions of his \"Italy\" and his\r\n\"Poems.\" Shortly after Rogers' death a collection of his witty sayings was\r\npublished under the title of \"Table Talk.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Horace Vernet]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His early works]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vernet's earnings]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Highest artistic honors]\r\n\r\nAt the Parisian Art Exposition of this year, Horace Vernet, the celebrated\r\nFrench battle painter, had a Salon devoted entirely to his works. The walls\r\nwere covered by his immense canvases. At this time Vernet was the most\r\nsuccessful of French artists. Born at the Louvre at the outbreak of the\r\nFrench Revolution, Vernet in his early career was identified with the\r\nevents of that epoch. For the Duke of Orleans he painted his celebrated\r\nseries of the four revolutionary battles, \"Jemmapes, Hanau, Montmirail, and\r\nValmy.\" In 1812 he received his first important commission from King Jerome\r\nof Westphalia, and in 1813 another from Empress Marie Louise. In 1814,\r\nHorace Vernet, with his father and Géricault, fought on the Barrière de\r\nClichy, and for his gallant conduct there received the decoration of the\r\nLegion of Honor from the hands of Napoleon. After the Restoration, Vernet\r\nachieved a great success by his \"Battle of Torlosa,\" which was purchased\r\nfor 6,000 francs for the Maison du Roi. At the Salon of 1819 Vernet\r\ncontested the field with Géricault and Ingres, whose \"Medusa\" and\r\n\"Odalisque\" were the success of the season. By his popular lithographs of\r\nNapoleonic scenes, Vernet so jeopardized his interests at Court that it was\r\nthought best for him to transfer his studio from Paris to Rome. On his\r\nreturn from there in 1822 he painted his masterpiece, \"The Defence of the\r\nBarrier of Clichy,\" for which Odiot paid 4,000 francs. It was presented to\r\nthe Chamber of Peers, from which it was transferred subsequently to the\r\nGallery of the Louvre. Thenceforward Vernet's pictures, the first of which\r\nhad sold for a few hundred francs, commanded ever higher prices. For\r\nAvignon, his ancestral home, Horace Vernet painted \"Mazeppa Pursued by\r\nWolves,\" a picture which was injured by a sabre stroke in the artist's\r\nstudio. After his election to the Institute, Vernet changed the style of\r\nhis subjects, charging staggering prices. For a ceiling fresco in the\r\nMuseum of Charles X. he received 17,910 francs; for \"Phillip Augustus\r\nBefore Bovines,\" now at Versailles, 24,775 francs; for \"The Battle of\r\nFontenoy,\" 30,000 francs. Still these pictures were scarcely up to the\r\nstandard of the \"Barrier of Clichy,\" and on Vernet's second removal to Rome\r\nhis art seemed to decline. After many years spent in Rome and with French\r\narmies in Algiers and in the Orient, Vernet went to Russia, where he was\r\nreceived with great favor at the Court of the Czar. The highest financial\r\npoint in his career was marked by a 50,000-franc commission for a portrait\r\nof the Russian Empress. He returned to France in good time to receive, in\r\n1855, the greatest honors yet showered upon a French painter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Leaves of Grass\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: American \"Know Nothings\"]\r\n\r\nIn America, Longfellow brought out his \"Hiawatha\" and Walt Whitman\r\npublished \"Leaves of Grass.\" At this period the \"Know Nothing\" Party had\r\ncome to be a power in politics. The party had started from a New York\r\nsociety formed to check the influence of the Pope, for purifying the ballot\r\nand maintaining the Bible in the public schools. It was called the American\r\nParty. Wherever the difference of opinion on the Missouri Compromise in\r\n1854 dissolved party ties in the North, multitudes flocked to the new\r\nparty. Before 1855 it had a million and a half of voters. In 1854 it all\r\nbut wrecked the old organizations. In Virginia, Henry A. Wise, an old Whig,\r\nled the Democratic Party, and overthrew the new organization. At the\r\nNational Convention of the new party, Southern resolutions were adopted by\r\na vote of 80 to 59. The Northern delegates met and repudiated the\r\nanti-slavery alliance. In 1855 the party carried New York, California and\r\nMassachusetts, and the Democrats carried New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana\r\nand Illinois.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stirring party contest]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Buchanan elected]\r\n\r\nThe American Convention met in Philadelphia, February 22, and nominated\r\nFillmore and Donelson. On the same day a convention met at Pittsburg to\r\neffect a national organization of the Republican Party, which appointed a\r\nNational Convention for the 17th of June, the anniversary of Bunker Hill.\r\nThe Democratic Convention met at Cincinnati. Pierce, Douglas and Buchanan\r\nwere candidates. On the seventeenth ballot Buchanan was chosen by unanimous\r\nvote with Breckenridge for Vice-President. The Republican Convention met,\r\nand in it were King, Clay, Wilson and Wilmot. Fremont was made a candidate\r\nby 359 votes against 196 for McLean. For Vice-President, Abraham Lincoln\r\nhad 110 votes, but Dayton received the majority. The nominees of the\r\nAmerican Convention were afterward withdrawn. The various nominees each\r\nrepresented real issues. Buchanan stood for the South, Fremont for\r\nnon-extension, and Fillmore for the Union. The election resulted in the\r\nchoice of Buchanan, who received 1,838,169 votes, to Fremont's 1,341,000,\r\nand Fillmore's 875,000. Of the electoral votes, Buchanan received 174,\r\nFremont 114, and Fillmore 8.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Struggle in Kansas]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Bleeding Kansas\"]\r\n\r\nAt another election in Kansas to choose members of the Territorial\r\nLegislature, armed bodies from Missouri took possession of the polls and\r\nelected a pro-slavery Legislature. Of 6,218 votes cast but 1,310 were\r\nlegal. Governor Reeder set the election aside and ordered another. May 22,\r\nsupplementary elections were held and the Free State men won. June 11,\r\nGovernor Reeder was charged with fraud in the purchase of the Indian lands,\r\nand, on July 26, was removed. Dawson was appointed in his place, with\r\nWoodson as acting-governor. On July 2, the pro-slavery Legislature met at\r\nPawnee, organized, expelled nine Free State members, and adjourned to the\r\nShawnee Mission, near the Missouri State line. Thereupon the Free State men\r\nmet at Lawrence, repudiated the Shawnee Mission Legislature as spurious,\r\nand summoned a new convention at Topeka. The Convention adopted a Free\r\nState Constitution, and nominated Reeder for Congress. On October 1, the\r\npro-slavery party elected Whitfield for Congress by more votes than the\r\ncensus list contained. The Free Staters declared the pro-slavery\r\nLegislature to have been elected by fraud. A rival government was\r\norganized. Discord, violence, and crime prevailed for a year. \"Bleeding\r\nKansas\" became an issue in American national politics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Congress takes action]\r\n\r\nThe House resolved by 101 to 93 votes to send a special committee to Kansas\r\nto inquire into the anarchy prevailing there. The committee consisted of\r\nHoward, Sherman, and Oliver. After several weeks' investigation they\r\nreturned and reported that every election in Kansas had been carried by\r\nMissourians, and the people had been prevented from exercising their\r\nrights; that the Legislature was illegal and its acts null and void; that\r\nWhitfield held his seat under no valid law, and Reeder had received more\r\nvotes than he; that a well-devised election law was necessary, and\r\nimpartial judges should be guarded by United States troops, and that the\r\nTopeka Free Soil Convention embodied the will of the majority. A bill\r\nadmitting Kansas under her free constitution was defeated by 107 to 106,\r\nbut was subsequently passed by 99 to 97. In the Senate the bill was\r\ndefeated. Meanwhile turmoil and disorder continued in Kansas. Finally\r\nnegotiations between Shannon, and the Free State leaders suspended the feud\r\nfor a time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mexican filibusters]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Count Bouldon shot]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alvarez revolution]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Santa Anna withdraws]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anarchy in Mexico]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Comonfort]\r\n\r\nThe latest attempts to overthrow the government in Mexico, while they\r\nbrought General Santa Anna once more to the head of affairs seriously\r\nimperilled his position. After the release of the United States Government\r\nfrom guarding the frontiers of Mexico, the Indians once more became\r\ntroublesome. Predatory bands of Apaches and Comanches so ravaged the\r\nprovince of Cohauila that the government had to distribute arms among the\r\ninhabitants. A filibustering expedition under Major Walker of Kentucky\r\nestablished itself in Lower California. They proclaimed the independence of\r\nthat province, so as to bring about annexation by the United States. A\r\nstrong display of Mexican forces had the effect of driving them into Texas.\r\nAnother filibustering expedition led by a French adventurer who called\r\nhimself Count Raousset de Bouldon terrorized the north. From Guyamas this\r\nexpedition marched inland, but was defeated in the first encounter with a\r\nstrong Mexican force. Raousset de Bouldon was taken captive and was shot.\r\nMore serious was a military revolution in the south led by General Alvarez.\r\nIn his proclamation of Ayutla, Alvarez called for a new Constitution and a\r\nnew Congress, and promised such reforms as the abolition of personal\r\ntaxation, of military conscription, and of the feudal system of passports.\r\nOther popular leaders like Bravo and Moreno joined the movement. In vain\r\ndid Santa Anna put forth all the powers of a military dictator. The\r\nrevolutionists took Monterey, and the insurrection spread throughout the\r\ncountry until it reached the capital. Santa Anna gathered fourteen hundred\r\nof his best troops and left the City of Mexico to march upon his enemies.\r\nSoon the hopelessness of his enterprise became apparent. On the way to Vera\r\nCruz he suddenly abdicated, and embarked on August 19 for Havana. Scarcely\r\nhad Santa Anna left Mexico when the country was plunged into new\r\ndisorders. General Carrera, on August 15, declared for the plan of Ayutla\r\nand proclaimed himself Vice-President. Funds were raised by a forced loan\r\nfrom the clerical orders. Several provinces of Mexico refused to recognize\r\nCarrera. Within a month he had to abdicate. He was succeeded at first by\r\nGeneral Diaz de la Vavaga, and then by Juan Alvarez, the leader of the\r\nPuros. While he tried to establish his rule, General Vidini in the north\r\nstrove to wrest the States of Cohauila, Tamaulipas and Nuego Leon from\r\nMexico, to form an independent republic under the name of Sierra Madre.\r\nBefore the close of the year Alvarez likewise found his position untenable\r\nand resigned. General Comonfort seized the reins of power as substitute\r\npresident--the thirty-sixth President within forty years, the fifth within\r\nfour months. He fell heir to the serious international complication with\r\nSpain resulting from the unpaid dividends of Mexico's original debt of\r\nindemnity to that country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of Taiping movement]\r\n\r\nIn China, the Taiping rebels still holding Lintsing were beset by the\r\nimperial troops. They were expelled from the province of Shantung during\r\nthe spring, but on the other hand carried their arms up the Yangtse-Kiang\r\nas far as Ichang, and eastward from Nanking to the sea. The establishment\r\nof the Taiping power at Nanking attracted the attention of Europeans. At\r\nlength a ruthless system of capital executions, by which nearly one hundred\r\nthousand victims are believed to have perished, terrorized China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1856\r\n\r\n\r\nIn America, the increasing virulence of the long controversy over slavery\r\nwas brought home to the people by a cowardly assault committed by one\r\nAlbert Rust upon Horace Greeley, the editor of the New York \"Tribune,\" and\r\none of the leaders of the agitation against slavery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Buford in Kansas]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Kansas War\"]\r\n\r\nAt a Territorial election in Kansas on January 15 a Legislature was chosen,\r\nand Robinson was elected Governor under the Free State Constitution.\r\nJanuary 26, President Pierce recognized the pro-slavery Legislature in\r\nKansas, and, on February 11, by proclamation ordered the dispersion of\r\narmed invaders of Kansas. The Legislature met at Topeka, March 4, and\r\ninaugurated Robinson. Congress appointed a committee to investigate the\r\nKansas troubles. On May 5, the Grand Jury of Douglas County found\r\nindictments against Reeder, Robinson and Lane, the Free State leaders. In\r\nthe spring of 1856, Colonel Buford of Alabama, with a thousand young men\r\nfrom South Carolina and Georgia, came to Kansas in military array. In May,\r\nLawrence was surrounded by these men bearing Federal arms taken from the\r\nUnited States armory. Nearly all the pro-slavery leaders were with them.\r\nThey demanded the surrender of the people's arms. The inhabitants were\r\nunprepared to resist. The armed pro-slavery force marched through the town,\r\ndestroying the hotels and printing-offices and the residence of Governor\r\nRobinson, doing a damage of $150,000. Such was the beginning of the \"Kansas\r\nWar\" which continued throughout the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Osawatomie Brown\"]\r\n\r\nActing-Governor Woodson proclaimed the Territory to be in a state of\r\nrebellion. A large pro-slavery force was gathering at Lecompton and another\r\nat Santa Fé. Osawatomie was captured, seven men were killed and thirty\r\nbuildings burned. Among the killed was a son of John Brown. Atchison's\r\npro-slavery force withdrew into Missouri. On September 1, in a municipal\r\nelection at Leavenworth, an armed band of Missourians killed and wounded a\r\nnumber of Free State men, burned their houses, and compelled one hundred\r\nand fifty of them to embark for St. Louis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fight at Lawrence]\r\n\r\nThe attack on Lawrence was renewed under the direct authority of the\r\ngovernment. Many lives were lost. The United States troops at Leavenworth\r\nwere used by Shannon. The Free State Legislature was dispersed by the\r\nUnited States forces. Other Missouri forces invaded the Territory and\r\ndestroyed Brown's village of Osawatomie, but the Free State men compelled\r\nthem to retreat across the Missouri. In September, President Pierce\r\nappointed Gray Governor of Kansas. Arriving at Lecompton, he released\r\nRobinson and other Free State prisoners on bail, and ordered all hostile\r\nforces to disband. On September 15, three regiments of Missourians with\r\ncannon attacked Lawrence. Governor Gray with United States troops\r\ncompelled them to retire. December 15, Lecompton, a partisan judge, was\r\nremoved on demand of the Governor, and Harrison of Kentucky was appointed.\r\nThe Free State preponderance among settlers constantly increased. Nearly\r\nall the clearing, plowing, and planting was done by Free State men. All\r\nmanner of irregularities constantly thinned the ranks of volunteers from\r\nthe South. Kansas, according to Greeley's expressive phrase, \"was steadily\r\nhardening into the bone and sinew of a Free State.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Senator Sumner assaulted]\r\n\r\nThe National Convention of the American Party virtually approved the\r\nFugitive Slave law and the Kansas-Nebraska act. In Congress, Sumner\r\ndelivered a philippic on \"The Crime against Kansas,\" in which he commented\r\nseverely on Senator Butler of South Carolina. Thereupon Preston Brooks\r\nbrutally assaulted Sumner in his seat in the Senate. As a result of his\r\ninjuries Sumner was an invalid for four years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Puebla revolts]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, President Comonfort had barely reached a temporary adjustment of\r\ndifficulties with Spain when his government was embarrassed by a serious\r\ninsurrection in Puebla. Government troops in overwhelming numbers put a\r\nbloody end to the revolt. Orihuela, the rebel chief, was shot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Friction with Spain]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil war in Mexico]\r\n\r\nA new liberal Constitution in Mexico, proclaimed by President Comonfort,\r\ndid not mend matters much in that distracted republic. New troubles with\r\nSpain arose over unpunished robberies and murders of Spanish subjects. In\r\nMarch, diplomatic intercourse between the two countries was severed.\r\nSpanish warships were ordered to the Gulf of Mexico. At the last moment,\r\ndiplomatic mediation on the part of England and France succeeded in\r\naverting war. General Comonfort, finding himself unable to make much\r\nheadway by constitutional means, invoked the help of General Zuloaga, and\r\nestablished himself once more as military dictator. When it came to\r\ndividing the spoils, Comonfort and Zuloaga fell out, and a seven days'\r\nconflict resulted. Comonfort's followers were routed. The defeated\r\nPresident had to flee the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Heine]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heine's Muse]\r\n\r\nHeinrich Heine, the foremost German lyric poet, died at Paris, February 18.\r\nThe last ten years of his life were clouded by ill health. Heine derived\r\nhis first poetic inspiration from A.W. Schlegel, while a student at the\r\nUniversity of Bonn. In the literary and artistic circle of Rachel Varnhagel\r\nin Berlin he found further encouragement in his early literary labors. He\r\nwas a Jew, but, for the purpose of taking up the study of law, he had\r\nhimself baptized a Christian, and became a doctor of law at the University\r\nof Göttingen. After a journey to England, he gave up law to devote himself\r\nexclusively to the pursuit of letters. In 1827, he brought out his \"Buch\r\nder Lieder,\" and followed this up with the first part of his famous\r\n\"Reisebilder.\" Heine's lyrics, by their unwonted grace and sprightliness,\r\ncaptivated German readers. Some of his songs, like that of the \"Lorelei\" or\r\n\"Thou Art Like a Flower,\" soon became German folksongs. More\r\ncharacteristic, perhaps, of Heine's light muse are lines like these:\r\n\r\n  A youth once loved a maiden,\r\n    But for another she sighed;\r\n  This other loved still another\r\n    And took her for his bride.\r\n\r\n  The maid for spite then married\r\n    The first that came along;\r\n  Alas for the youth who loved her,\r\n    He suffered grievous wrong!\r\n\r\n  It is an old, old story,\r\n    But yet it is ever new,\r\n  And the one to whom it happens\r\n    His heart is broken in two.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The poet in Paris]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"La Mouche\"]\r\n\r\nShortly after the July Revolution, Heine went to Paris, where he became a\r\ncontributor to several of the foremost literary journals of the day as a\r\nwriter of French feuilletons. His French prose style was almost equal to\r\nhis brilliant command of German. Not until 1844 did Heine bring out any new\r\nGerman poems. Then he published the epic satires \"Germany, a Winter's\r\nTale,\" and \"Atta Troll, a Summer Night's Dream,\" two works which aroused\r\nintense indignation in Germany. Much was made of the fact that Heine\r\naccepted an annual pension of 4,800 francs from the government of Louis\r\nPhilippe. On the other hand, Heine made the terse observation that whenever\r\nhe was treated with rude discourtesy he could be sure that he had met a\r\nGerman. In Paris, the poet was captivated by the charm of young Matilde\r\nMirat, his \"lotos flower,\" as he called her, or also \"la mouche.\" The\r\nuneducated yet infinitely charming and loyal grisette was the good angel of\r\nHeine's later years. On the eve of the famous duel with his rival poet\r\nBörne, in 1841, Heine married Matilde at the Church of St. Sulpice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deathbed wit]\r\n\r\nTo his sorrow the poet lived many more years suffering great agony from a\r\nspinal complaint which confined him to his bed, or \"mattress grave\" as he\r\ncalled it. His powers of wit and raillery never failed him, even to the\r\nlast. On the night before he died an anxious friend called to bid farewell.\r\nHe asked if the dying man had made his \"peace with God.\" Heine replied with\r\na wan smile: \"Do not trouble yourself. God will pardon me. That's his\r\ntrade.\" These were the last recorded words spoken by Heine. Another story\r\nhas it that when the physician put a handglass to the lips of the dying man\r\nand said, \"Can you hiss (siffler)?\" Heine murmured, \"No, not even a play of\r\nScribe.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German romantic poets]\r\n\r\nAmong German writers of this period, Friedrich Rueckert, the lyric poet,\r\nand Fritz Reuter, who wrote in Low German dialect, were at the height of\r\ntheir activity. Emanuel Geibel presented himself as heir presumptive to the\r\nmantle of Heine. Unlike Heine, this poet devoted his muse to the\r\nglorification of German patriotism. He achieved such a success that he was\r\nsoon called to Munich, where he brought out the first \"Golden Book of\r\nPoets.\" Other German poets, such as Gottfried Kinkel, the revolutionist,\r\nHoffmann von Fallersleben, and Ferdinand Freiligrath, famous outside of\r\nGermany for his happy translations of English and American verse, had to\r\nwrite their poems in exile.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Biela's comet]\r\n\r\nOn February 18, Wilhelm von Biela, the great German astronomer, died at\r\nVenice. Born in 1782 at Rossla in the Hartz Mountains, he entered the\r\nAustrian military service in 1805, and was made colonel in 1826, and\r\ncommandant of Rovigo in 1832. On February 27, 1826, he discovered the\r\nfamous comet named after him. According to Biela's prediction, the comet\r\nreturned every six years and thirty-eight weeks until 1852. Thereafter it\r\nwas not seen as a comet during the century. Biela also discovered two other\r\ncomets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crimean peace conference]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Black Sea and Danube opened]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Status Quo in Balkans]\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Sebastopol, Austria made another attempt to secure peace.\r\nTwo of the Powers, France and Russia, were heartily weary of the war. Louis\r\nNapoleon had entered the struggle merely to gain military glory and\r\npolitical prestige. He had succeeded in attaining his ends. Alexander II.,\r\nwho had continued the war largely as a matter of filial piety, was ready to\r\nseize the first opportunity to conclude peace with honor. A Congress was\r\ntherefore assembled in Paris to draw up terms satisfactory to all\r\nconcerned. On March 30, a treaty was signed which gave Kars back to the\r\nSultan and restored Sebastopol to the Czar. The Porte was admitted to the\r\nConcert of Powers. Most important was the regulation of the navigation of\r\nthe Black Sea. It was decreed in the treaty that \"the Black Sea is\r\nneutralized; its waters and its ports, thrown open to the mercantile marine\r\nof every nation, are formally and in perpetuity interdicted to the flag of\r\nwar of the Powers possessing its coasts or of any other Power.\" Patrolling\r\nof the sea by small armed vessels was permitted. The Danube was thrown open\r\nto the commerce of the world. In order more fully to secure free navigation\r\nof the river, the Czar's frontier in Bessarabia was somewhat changed by\r\nthe cession of certain territory to Moldavia under the suzerainty of the\r\nPorte. Both Wallachia and Moldavia continued under the protection of\r\nTurkey, and were permitted to enjoy their former privileges. The _status\r\nquo_ of Servia was assured. It was further stipulated that, following the\r\nancient rule of the Sultans, no foreign war vessels were to pass through\r\nthe Dardanelles and the Bosphorus while Turkey was at peace. To insure the\r\nintegrity of the Ottoman Empire, England, France and Austria signed a\r\ntreaty, on April 15, guaranteeing the independence of the Sultan's\r\ndominions and declaring that any violation of this would call for war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Paris convention]\r\n\r\nBesides drawing up the treaty of peace, the Congress of Paris settled\r\nvarious moot points in international law. The plenipotentiaries all agreed\r\nto the doctrines: \"First, privateering is and remains abolished. Second,\r\nthe neutral flag covers enemy's goods, with the exception of contraband of\r\nwar. Third, neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are not\r\nliable to capture under an enemy's flag. Fourth, blockades in order to be\r\nbinding must be effective; that is to say, maintained by a force sufficient\r\nreally to prevent access to the enemy's coast.\" The United States of\r\nAmerica did not subscribe to this convention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Results of Crimean war]\r\n\r\nRussia came out of the conflict defeated but respected. She had received a\r\ncheck in the Black Sea and her frontier line had been readjusted. Still her\r\npolitical losses were trivial. The war most deeply affected Austria. She\r\nhad played a false game and had lost. The sceptre of European leadership\r\nslipped from her. The situation afforded to Bismarck and Cavour the\r\nopportunity each was anxiously awaiting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Italy benefited]\r\n\r\nCavour had won his first point. At the Conference of Paris he took his\r\nplace as a representative of Sardinia by right of an alliance with the\r\nother great Powers. Then it was seen that every Italian soldier who had\r\nfallen on the Tchernaya, or who had wasted away in the fever-stricken\r\ncamps, had died indeed for the honor of Italy among the nations of the\r\nworld. At the close of the Conference Cavour made a plain statement\r\nconcerning the misgovernment of southern and central Italy and the evils of\r\nthe Austrian occupation. When Count Buol von Schauenstein protested, the\r\nFrench and English representatives supported Cavour. The effect of these\r\nrepresentations was such that there was a sudden change in Austria's\r\nrestrictive measures hitherto inflicted upon her Italian dominions. Old\r\nMarshal Radetzky, the man of the sword, was retired. The sequestrated\r\nItalian estates were returned to their owners. Emperor Francis Joseph came\r\nin person to Milan to proclaim a general amnesty. His brother Maximilian, a\r\nprince of liberal tendencies, came with his young bride Charlotte to undo\r\nthe harsh measures of the military government. Maximilian's liberal policy\r\nproved too much for the narrow spirit of the Ministry at home.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: After effects in England]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Friction with America]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Australian Home Rule]\r\n\r\nOne of the first results of the Crimean war was the threatened suspension\r\nof the Bank of England. In November, it was found that the reserve funds\r\nof the Bank had shrunk to £1,462,153, while the deposits that might at any\r\nmoment be drawn out aggregated £18,248,003. In these circumstances, a\r\nspecial bill of Parliament authorized a new issue of paper notes for\r\n£180,000 more than the law permitted. Furthermore, the war with Russia left\r\nbehind it a dispute between the governments of Great Britain and of the\r\nUnited States. Under the provisions of a recent foreign enlistment bill in\r\nEngland, American citizens had been induced to enter the British military\r\nservice. The American Government complained that the practice was in\r\nviolation of international law. The point was practically conceded by the\r\nEnglish Government, which at once put a stop to the enlistment of American\r\ncitizens and tendered an apology to the government of the United States.\r\nThe situation was aggravated by the fact that one of the attachés of the\r\nAmerican Legation in London at this very time was refused admission to a\r\ndiplomatic levee at the Court of St. James because he did not appear in\r\ncourt dress. The British Minister at Washington received his passports. In\r\nAustralia, the first Home Rule Parliament had been opened at Sydney by Sir\r\nWilliam Denison. The popular elections were conducted under the famous\r\nballot system which was afterward adopted in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Singular suicidal mania]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, the province of Natal was separated from Cape Colony, and\r\nbecame an independent Crown Colony with a constitution of its own. The land\r\nof the Basutos, no longer under British protectorate, suffered greatly from\r\nhostile incursions and cattle raids from the Boers. During the summer the\r\nKaffirs fell victims to a fatal delusion. Their prophet Amaxosa foretold\r\nthe resurrection of all their dead heroes and warriors, on condition that\r\nthey themselves should put an end to their lives. In all, some 50,000\r\nKaffirs committed suicide. Emigrants from Cape Colony occupied the Kaffir\r\nlands, which had become depopulated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Affair of \"The Arrow\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British reprisals on China]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canton bombarded]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insufficient British forces]\r\n\r\nIn October, the Chinese Emperor, beset as he was by the victorious Taiping\r\nrebels, was made to feel the heavy hand of Great Britain. A Portuguese\r\nlorcha, \"The Arrow,\" flying the British flag though without British\r\nregister, was overhauled by the Chinese authorities while at anchor near\r\nDutch Folly. One of her crew had been recognized as one of a band of\r\npirates who had committed some recent outrages. The Taotai of Canton had\r\nthe offender arrested. Sir John Bowring at Hong Kong at once protested. The\r\nChinese Imperial Commissioner Yeh replied that \"The Arrow\" was not a\r\nforeign vessel, and therefore declined to enter into any discussion about\r\nher. As a first step toward obtaining reparation the British seized a\r\nChinese imperial junk and held her in reprisal. As this failed to bring the\r\nChinese to terms, Sir Michael Seymour with a British squadron bombarded and\r\nseized the barrier forts of Canton. The fleet proceeded up the river, and,\r\nafter capturing the Chinese fort of Macao Passage, came to anchor before\r\nCanton. An ultimatum was addressed to Yeh, stating that unless he at once\r\ncomplied with all English demands they would \"proceed with the destruction\r\nof all the defences and public buildings of the city and of the government\r\nvessels in the harbor.\" No reply was vouchsafed. The Canton forts were\r\nseized by the British and their men-of-war trained guns on the city. All\r\nable-bodied Chinamen were called upon by the Viceroy of Canton to rally for\r\nthe defence of their city. The British bombarded Canton and sunk a large\r\nfleet of Chinese war junks up the river. A fort at French Folly was\r\nreduced, and the Bogue forts on both sides of the river were captured. The\r\nChinese retaliated by burning the whole foreign settlement, and by chopping\r\noff the heads of all the Englishmen who came into their power. Sir Michael\r\nSeymour found his force inadequate to capture Canton, and had to withdraw\r\nfrom his positions while he sent home a request for reinforcements. The\r\nurgency of the request opened the eyes of the British Foreign Secretary to\r\nthe gravity of the situation. A force of 1,500 men was at once sent from\r\nEngland, another regiment from Mauritius, and a division from the Madras\r\narmy. The situation in India shortly became such that this force never\r\nreached China.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British war with Persia]\r\n\r\nNew difficulties had arisen with Persia respecting Herat. The death of Yar\r\nMuhammad Khan in 1852 was followed by intrigues in Herat. The province\r\nbecame a bone of contention between the Shah of Persia and the aged Dost\r\nMuhammad Khan. This ruler's hostility to England during the second Sikh war\r\nhad been condoned, and a treaty of friendship concluded between him and\r\nLord Dalhousie. In virtue of this treaty the British sided with Dost\r\nMuhammad. When the Shah moved an army into Herat and captured the capital,\r\nEngland declared war on Persia. Arms and munitions in great quantity were\r\npresented to Dost Muhammad, together with a subsidy of ten thousand pounds\r\na month so long as the Persian war should last. An expedition under Sir\r\nJames Outram was sent from Bombay to the Gulf of Persia. The capture of\r\nBushire by the English and their victory at Mohamrah brought the Shah of\r\nPersia to withdraw his troops from Afghanistan. Herat was relinquished.\r\nWhile the war lasted a new danger to the British Indian Empire arose at\r\nDelhi. In July, the heir-apparent of old Bahadur Shah, the reigning King of\r\nDelhi, suddenly died. A younger queen was believed to have poisoned him.\r\nShe persuaded Bahadur Shah to proclaim her son heir to the throne. Lord\r\nCanning withheld Great Britain's recognition. An elder brother was\r\nrecognized as successor by Lord Canning, on condition that he should leave\r\nDelhi upon his succession to the throne and take up his abode at Kutut. The\r\nyoung Queen was moved to wild wrath. She was a daughter of the House of\r\nNadir Shah, burning with the traditional ambitions of her family. Forthwith\r\nshe took a part in all manner of intrigues against the English on the side\r\nof Persia as well as of the Afghans. The remarkable outbursts of\r\nanti-British feeling that followed have been credited to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1857\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chinese war ships sank]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assault on Fatshan]\r\n\r\nThe reverses of the Persians brought the Shah to terms. A treaty of peace\r\nwas presently concluded in which all claim to Herat was abandoned by\r\nPersia. Early in the year the British expedition in China resumed\r\nhostilities. Commodore Elliot with five gunboats and a host of small boats\r\ndestroyed a fleet of forty armed junks. Next an attack was delivered on the\r\nChinese headquarters at Fatshan. A flotilla of English small boats cut\r\ntheir way through the long line of war junks, and a landing party under\r\nCommodore Harry Keppel attacked the main position. The Commodore's boat was\r\nsunk and several others had to be abandoned. A number of the Chinese junks\r\nwere burned. Keppel's force was found too small to capture Fatshan. Sir\r\nMichael Seymour decided to postpone further hostilities until the arrival\r\nof the promised reinforcements that were to come after Lord Elgin. When\r\nthese troops failed to arrive in good time, Lord Elgin went to Calcutta\r\nhimself to hasten their despatch. There he found affairs of far more\r\nserious import than those in China.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murmurs in India]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The greased cartridges]\r\n\r\nSome time previously rumors had been circulated concerning a danger to\r\nBritish rule in India. Mysterious little cakes were circulated far and\r\nwide. Lord Canning, the new Governor-General, was blamed for not taking\r\nalarm. A dangerous story got abroad early in the year. The Enfield rifle\r\nhad been introduced. Its cartridges were greased with animal lubricants.\r\nThe fat of pigs was hateful to Mohammedans, while that of cows was still\r\nmore of an abomination in the eyes of the Hindus. At Barrackpore, near\r\nCalcutta, where Sepoys were stationed, a Laskar reviled a Brahmin as\r\ndefiled by the British cartridges. The whole of the Bengal army was seized\r\nwith horror. The British authorities claimed that none of the greased\r\ncartridges had been issued to the Sepoys. The story of the greased\r\ncartridges ran up the Ganges to Benares, Delhi and Meerut. It was soon\r\nnoised abroad that the bones of cows and pigs had been ground to powder and\r\nthrown into wells with flour and butter in order to destroy the caste of\r\nthe Hindus so as to convert them to Christianity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hindu soldiers demur]\r\n\r\nIn March, incendiary fires broke out at Barrackpore. The Sepoys from the\r\nNineteenth Regiment refused to receive the cartridges dealt out to them.\r\nThere was only one white regiment in the 400 miles between Barrackpore and\r\nPatna. After remonstrances had been made by the English officers, the\r\nSepoys returned, but there still remained disaffection at Benares, Lucknow,\r\nAgra and other places. When it was believed that the excitement was allayed\r\nanother outbreak occurred at Lucknow. Lawrence's energetic measures\r\nmaintained order in Oude. The mutiny was only scattered, however. Within a\r\nweek Meerut, thirty-eight miles northeast of Delhi, and the largest\r\ncantonment in India, was in a blaze. The story of the greased cartridges\r\nhad been capped by that of the bone dust. Some eighty-five of a regiment of\r\nSepoy cavalry refused to take the cartridges and were marched off to the\r\nguard-house. During the afternoon of the following Sunday, when the\r\nEuropean officers were preparing for church, the imprisoned Sepoys were\r\nliberated with others. They shot down every European they met.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Indian mutiny]\r\n\r\nThe mutiny became a revolt. The rebellious Sepoys marched on Delhi. When\r\nthe rebel troops came up from Meerut the English officers prepared to meet\r\nthem. Their Sepoys joined the mutineers. The revolt spread throughout\r\nDelhi. In despair, Willoughby blew up the fort with 1,500 rebels who were\r\nassaulting it. Only four of his command escaped. Willoughby himself died\r\nsix weeks afterward, while India and Europe were ringing with his name.\r\nFifty Englishmen whom the rebels had captured were butchered in cold blood.\r\nDelhi on Monday evening was in rebel hands. The remaining officers on the\r\nRidge fled for their lives. Their subsequent suffering was one of the\r\nharrowing features of the great convulsion. The revolution at Delhi opened\r\nLord Canning's eyes. He telegraphed for regiments from Bombay, Burma,\r\nMadras and Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lahore mutineers foiled]\r\n\r\nOn May 11, the news of the outbreak at Meerut was brought to the\r\nauthorities at Lahore. Meean Meer is a large military cantonment five or\r\nsix miles from Lahore, and there were then some four thousand native troops\r\nthere, with only about thirteen hundred Europeans of the Queen's and the\r\nCompany's service. There was no time to be lost. A parade was ordered on\r\nthe morrow at Meean Meer. On the parade-ground an order was given for a\r\nmilitary movement which brought the heads of four columns of the native\r\ntroops in front of twelve guns charged with grape, the artillerymen with\r\ntheir port-fires lighted, and the soldiers of one of the Queen's regiments\r\nstanding behind with loaded muskets. A command was given to the Sepoys to\r\nstack arms. Cowed, they piled their arms, which were borne away at once in\r\ncarts by the European soldiers. All chances of a rebellious movement were\r\nover for the moment in the Punjab.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Situation at Lucknow]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Jhansi]\r\n\r\nAt three stations--Lucknow, Jhansi and Cawnpore--the mutiny was of\r\npolitical importance. The city of Lucknow, the capital of Oude, extended\r\nfour miles along the right bank of the river Goomti. The British Residency\r\nand other principal buildings were between the city and the river. The\r\nResidency was a walled inclosure, and near it stood a castellated\r\nstructure, the Muchi Bowun. Since the affair of May 3, Sir Henry Lawrence\r\nhad been making preparations for a defence in case of insurrection. The\r\nnative force consisted of three regiments of infantry and one of cavalry,\r\nall Sepoys, and there was a European force of 570 men with sixty\r\nartillerymen. Lawrence brought all the European non-combatants within the\r\nResidency walls, and established a strong post between the Residency and\r\nthe Muchi Bowun to command the two bridges which led to the cantonments.\r\nThe outbreak began on May 30, when the insurgents rushed to the bridges,\r\nand, being repulsed by Lawrence, made off to Delhi. At Jhansi, the garrison\r\nof fifty-five men was butchered in cold blood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defence of Cawnpore]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Cawnpore]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Englishwomen spared]\r\n\r\nAt Cawnpore, on the Ganges, fifty-five miles southwest of Lucknow, the\r\ntragedy was even more terrible. Cawnpore had been in the possession of the\r\nEnglish for more than fifty years. In May, sixty-one artillerymen and four\r\nSepoy regiments were there. Sir Hugh Wheeler, the commandant, prepared for\r\nthe coming storm. He took some old barracks and there quartered the white\r\nwomen, children and invalids. He accepted from the Nana, who professed\r\ngreat friendship, 200 Mahrattas and two guns. On the night of June 4, the\r\nSepoy regiment at Cawnpore broke out in mutiny. The Nana overtook them on\r\nthe road to Delhi and soon returned with them to Cawnpore. Sir Hugh was\r\ntaken by surprise on the morning of the 6th, when he received a message\r\nfrom the Nana, announcing that his men were about to attack the Englishmen.\r\nSir Hugh prepared for the defence of the barracks. The mutineers first\r\nrifled the city and cantonment, and murdered all the English who came in\r\ntheir way. At noon they opened fire on the intrenchments. From the 6th to\r\nthe 25th of June, the inmates struggled against fearful odds. Though\r\nstarving, they resisted successfully. On June 25, Wheeler received a\r\nproposal that safe passage would be given to Allahabad to those who were\r\nwilling to lay down their arms. An armistice was proclaimed, and next\r\nmorning terms were negotiated. The English were to capitulate and march\r\nout with their arms and sixty rounds of ammunition for each man, to the\r\nriver a mile away, where boats would be furnished for all. The next morning\r\nthey marched down to the boats--the men on foot, the wounded and\r\nnon-combatants on elephants and bullocks. They were all huddled together on\r\nboard the boats. Suddenly, at the sound of a bugle, a murderous fire was\r\nopened on them. The women and children, one hundred and twenty-five in\r\nnumber, were hurried off to prison, and the men were ordered to immediate\r\nexecution. All was soon over. Nana was proclaimed Peishwa. English\r\nreinforcements were coming from Allahabad. Nana hastened back to Cawnpore.\r\nThere, within a few days, more than two hundred English were taken\r\nprisoners. The men were all butchered, and eighty women and children were\r\nsent to join those in a house near the Nana. Great excitement prevailed in\r\nEngland, where it was believed that these women were subjected to all\r\nmanner of outrage and made to long for death as an escape from shame. As a\r\nmatter of fact the royal widows of the Nana's adoptive father did their\r\nutmost to protect the captive Englishwomen. They threatened to throw\r\nthemselves and their children from the palace windows should any harm\r\nbefall the English ladies. Thanks to them no worse indignity than the\r\ncompulsory grinding of corn was inflicted on the white women. Meanwhile,\r\nColonel Mill was pushing up from Calcutta. In July, he was joined at\r\nAllahabad by a column under General Havelock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Havelock to the relief]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Englishwomen slaughtered]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Cawnpore]\r\n\r\nIn July, Havelock left Allahabad for Cawnpore with 2,000 men, Europeans and\r\nSikhs. He burned to avenge the massacre of Cawnpore. On the 12th and 15th\r\nof July he inflicted three defeats on the enemy. When within twenty miles\r\nof Cawnpore, having halted for the night, he heard that the women and\r\nchildren at Cawnpore were still alive, and that the Nana had taken the\r\nfield to oppose him. He broke camp and marched fifteen miles that night. In\r\nthe meantime, the crowning atrocity was committed at Cawnpore. The defeated\r\nrebels had returned to the Nana. On receiving the tidings of their repulse,\r\nhe ordered the slaughter of the 200 women and children. They were hacked to\r\ndeath with swords, bayonets, knives and axes. Their remains were thrown\r\ninto a well. At 2 p.m. Havelock toiled on with a thousand Europeans and\r\nthree hundred Sikhs, and without cavalry and artillery, to meet the 5,000\r\nrebels. Failing to silence the enemy's batteries, Havelock ordered a\r\nbayonet charge. Nana Sahib with his followers took flight. He was never\r\nheard from again. The next morning Havelock marched into the station at\r\nCawnpore, and there found the well filled with mangled human remains. On\r\nJuly 20, having been reinforced by General Neill, whom he left in charge at\r\nCawnpore, Havelock set out for the relief of Lucknow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The defence of Lucknow]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Havelock captures Bethan]\r\n\r\nThe entire province of Oude was in a state of insurrection. The English had\r\nbeen closely besieged in Lucknow since the last day of May. The garrison\r\nhad held out for two months against fifty thousand Hindus. On July 4, Sir\r\nHenry Lawrence was killed by a shell which burst in his room. Two weeks\r\nlater, the rebels, learning of the advance of Havelock to Cawnpore,\r\nattacked the Residency with overwhelming force, but the garrison at last\r\ncompelled them to retire. By the middle of August, Havelock advanced toward\r\nBethan with 1,500 men. He met the enemy in force, and overcame him with a\r\nbayonet charge. The Mahratta palace was burned. This ended Havelock's first\r\ncampaign against Lucknow. Without cavalry for the pursuit of the enemy, he\r\nfell back to Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nDuring the months which followed the outbreak at Delhi, all political\r\ninterest was centred in that ancient capital of Hindustan. Its recapture\r\nwas vital to the re-establishment of British sovereignty. In the absence of\r\nrailways the British were slow to cope with the situation. Every European\r\nsoldier sent for the relief of Delhi from Calcutta was stopped en route. On\r\nJune 8, a month after the affair at Delhi, Sir Henry Barnard took the field\r\nat Alipano, ten miles away. He defeated the mutineers, and then marched to\r\nthe Ridge and reoccupied the old cantonment, which had been abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defence of Delhi]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delhi recaptured]\r\n\r\nOn June 23, the enemy made a desperate assault, and not long afterward\r\nrepeated the attempt. Reinforcements came from the Punjab. The British now\r\nhad 8,000 men. With their fifty-four guns they could shell the besiegers.\r\nAt last, at 3 a.m. on September 14, three columns were formed for a sortie,\r\nwith one in reserve. They rushed through the broken walls, and the first\r\nand second columns met at the Kabul Gate. Six days of desperate fighting\r\nfollowed. On September 20, the gates of the old fortified palace were\r\nbroken open, but the inmates had fled. Thus fell the imperial city. The\r\nBritish army lost 4,000 men, among them Brigadier-General Nicholson, who\r\nled the storming party. The great mutiny at Delhi was stamped out, and the\r\nBritish flag waved over the capital of Hindustan. This was the turning\r\npoint of the Sepoy mutiny.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British vengeance]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delhi princes murdered]\r\n\r\nThe capture of Delhi was followed by acts of barbarous retribution. Hindu\r\nprisoners were shot from the mouths of cannon. Hodson, of \"Hodson's Horse,\"\r\na young officer who had once been cashiered for high-handed conduct in\r\nIndia, offered to General Wilson to capture the king and the royal family\r\nof Delhi. General Wilson gave him authority to make the attempt, but\r\nstipulated that the life of the king should be spared. By the help of\r\nnative spies Hodson discovered that when Delhi was taken the king and his\r\nfamily had taken refuge in the tomb of the Emperor Hoomayoon. Hodson went\r\nboldly to this place with a few of his troopers. He found that the royal\r\nfamily of Delhi were surrounded there by a vast crowd of armed adherents.\r\nHe called upon them all to lay down their arms at once. They threw down\r\ntheir arms, and the king surrendered himself to Hodson. Next day the three\r\nroyal princes of Delhi were captured. Hodson borrowed a carbine from one of\r\nhis troopers and shot the three princes dead. Their corpses, half naked,\r\nwere exposed for some days at one of the gates of Delhi. Hodson committed\r\nthe deed deliberately. Several days before, he wrote to a friend to say\r\nthat if he got into the palace of Delhi, \"the House of Timour will not be\r\nworth five minutes' purchase, I ween.\" On the day after the deed he wrote:\r\n\"In twenty-four hours I disposed of the principal members of the House of\r\nTimour the Tartar. I am not cruel; but I confess that I do rejoice in the\r\nopportunity of ridding the earth of these ruffians.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Princess of Jhansi]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Amazon's death]\r\n\r\nThe mutineers had seized Gwalior, the capital of the Maharajah Scindia, who\r\nescaped to Agra. The English had to attack the rebels, retake Gwalior and\r\nrestore Scindia. One of those who fought to the last on the mutineers' side\r\nwas the Ranee, or Princess of Jhansi, whose territory had been one of the\r\nBritish annexations. She had flung all her energies into the rebellion. She\r\ntook the field with Nana Sahib and Tantia Topi. For months after the fall\r\nof Delhi she contrived to baffle Sir Hugh Rose and the English. She led\r\nsquadrons in the field. She fought with her own hand. She was foremost in\r\nthe battle for the possession of Gwalior. In the garb of a horseman she led\r\ncharge after charge, and she was killed among those who resisted to the\r\nlast. Her body was found upon the field, scarred with wounds enough to have\r\ndone credit to any hero. Sir Hugh Rose paid her a well-deserved tribute\r\nwhen he wrote: \"The best man upon the side of the enemy was the woman found\r\ndead, the Ranee of Jhansi.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relief of Lucknow]\r\n\r\nLucknow was still beleaguered. Late in September, Havelock had prepared for\r\na second attempt to relieve that place. Sir Colin Campbell had reached\r\nCalcutta as Commander-in-Chief. Sir James Outram had come to Allahabad on\r\nSeptember 16. He joined Havelock with 1,400 men. With generous chivalry the\r\n\"Bayard of India\" waived his rank in honor of Havelock. \"To you shall be\r\nleft the glory of relieving Lucknow,\" he wrote. \"I shall accompany you,\r\nplacing my military service at your disposal, as a volunteer.\" On September\r\n20, Havelock crossed the Granges into Oude with 2,500 men. Having twice\r\ndefeated the enemy, on September 25 he cut his way through the streets of\r\nLucknow. Late in the day he entered the British cantonments. The defence of\r\nthe Residency at Lucknow was a glorious episode in British annals. It has\r\nbeen sung in immortal strains by Alfred Tennyson. The fortitude of the\r\ngarrison was surpassed only by the self-sacrificing conduct of the women\r\nwho nursed the wounded and cared for all. They received the thanks of Queen\r\nVictoria for their heroic devotion. For four months the garrison had\r\nwatched for the succor which came at last. The surrounding city remained\r\nfor two months longer in rebel hands. In November, Sir Colin Campbell with\r\n2,000 men took charge of the intrenchments at Cawnpore, and then advanced\r\nagainst Lucknow with 5,000 men and thirty guns. He defeated the enemy and\r\ncarried away the beleaguered garrison with all the women and children.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cawnpore rises again]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Havelock]\r\n\r\nStill the British were unable to disperse the rebels and reoccupy the city.\r\nSir Colin Campbell left Outram with 4,000 men near Lucknow. He himself\r\nreturned to Cawnpore. On approaching that city he heard the roll of a\r\ndistant cannonade. Tantia Topi had come again to the front. He had\r\npersuaded the Gwalior contingent to break out in mutiny and march against\r\nCawnpore. General Windham resisted his advance. The whole city was in the\r\nhands of the rebel Sepoys, but the bridge of boats over the Ganges was\r\nsaved to the British. Sir Colin Campbell marched over it, and in safety\r\nreached the intrenchment in which Windham was shut up. He routed the\r\nGwalior rebels and drove them out of Cawnpore. General Havelock the day\r\nafter he left Lucknow succumbed to dysentery. Throughout the British Empire\r\nthere was universal sorrow that will never be forgotten so long as men\r\nrecall the memory of the mutinies of Fifty-seven. Havelock's victories had\r\naroused the drooping spirits of the British nation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aftermath of the Mutiny]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rose's brilliant campaign]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King of Delhi transported]\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of the Sepoy revolt is largely a recital of military\r\noperations for the dispossession of the rebels and the restoration of\r\nBritish supremacy. Sir Colin Campbell, now Lord Clyde, undertook a general\r\nand successful campaign against the rebels of Oude and Rohlikund, and Sir\r\nJames Outram drove them out of Lucknow, and re-established British\r\nsovereignty in the capital of Oude. At the same time a column under Sir\r\nHugh Rose and another under General Whitlock did a similar work in Central\r\nIndia and Bundelkund. Rose's campaign was peculiarly difficult. It was\r\ncarried out amid the jungles and ravines of the Vindhya Mountains, and in\r\nthe secluded regions of Bundelkund. He fought battles against baffling\r\nodds, and captured the stronghold of Jhansi. He then marched against Tantia\r\nTopi, who had an army of 40,000 near Kalpi, which he routed and scattered.\r\nHaving brought his campaign to a close, he congratulated his troops on\r\nhaving marched a thousand miles, defeated and dispersed the enemy, and\r\ncaptured a hundred guns. The old King of Delhi was put on trial, convicted\r\nand sentenced to transportation. He was sent to the Cape of Good Hope, but\r\nthe colonists there refused to receive him. The last of the line of the\r\nGreat Moguls of India had to go begging for a prison.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the year, when the Indian mutiny appeared to have spent\r\nits force, Lord Elgin returned from Calcutta to Hong Kong. In the meanwhile\r\nthe English, French and American Governments had exchanged notes on the\r\nsubject of Chinese outrages against Christians. Louis Napoleon was found to\r\nbe in hearty accord with England's desire to make an example of China.\r\nBaron Gros was sent to China charged with a mission similar to that of Lord\r\nElgin. The United States declined to join in active measures against China.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Buchanan, American President]\r\n\r\nIn the United States of America, James Buchanan had become President at\r\nsixty-six years of age. He had served as a member of Congress from 1821 to\r\n1831; then as Minister to Russia from 1832 to 1834; United States Senator\r\nfrom 1834 to 1845; Secretary of State under Polk from 1845 to 1849, and\r\nMinister to Great Britain from 1853 to 1856.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dred Scott case]\r\n\r\nBuchanan's first message repeated the assurance that the discussion of\r\nslavery had come to an end. The clergy were found fault with for fomenting\r\nthe disturbances. The President declared in favor of the admission of\r\nKansas with a Constitution agreeable to the majority of the settlers. He\r\nalso referred to an impending decision of the Supreme Court with which he\r\nhad been acquainted and asked acquiescence in it. This was Judge Taney's\r\ndecision in the Dred Scott case, rendered two days after Buchanan's\r\ninauguration. An action had been begun in the Circuit Court in Missouri by\r\nScott, a negro, for the freedom of himself and children. He claimed that he\r\nhad been removed by his master in 1834 to Illinois, a free State, and\r\nafterward taken into territory north of the compromise line. Sanford, his\r\nmaster, replied that Scott was not a citizen of Missouri, and could not\r\nbring an action, and that he and his children were Sanford's slaves. The\r\nlower courts differed, and the case was twice argued.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The decision]\r\n\r\nThe decision nullified the Missouri restriction, or, indeed, any\r\nrestriction by Congress on slavery in the Territories. Chief-Justice Taney\r\nsaid: \"The question is whether that class of persons (negroes) compose a\r\nportion of the people, and are constituent members of this sovereignty. We\r\nthink they are not included under the word citizen in the Constitution, and\r\ncan therefore claim none of the rights and privileges\" of that instrument.\r\n\"They were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class who\r\nhad been subjugated by the dominant race--and had no rights or privileges\r\nbut such as those who held the power and the government might choose to\r\ngrant them. They had for more than a century been regarded as beings of an\r\ninferior grade--and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white\r\nman is bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be\r\nreduced to slavery for his (the white man's) benefit. The negro race by\r\ncommon consent had been excluded from civilized governments and the family\r\nof nations and doomed to slavery. The unhappy black race were separated\r\nfrom the whites by indelible marks long before established, and were never\r\nthought of or spoken of except as property.\" The Chief-Justice nullified\r\nthe Missouri restriction, by asserting that \"the act of Congress, which\r\nprohibited a citizen from holding property of this kind north of the line\r\ntherein mentioned, is not warranted by the Constitution, and is therefore\r\nvoid.\" This made slavery the organic law of the land. Benton said that it\r\nwas \"no longer the exception with freedom the rule, but slavery the rule,\r\nwith freedom the exception.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financial distress]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trouble with Mormons]\r\n\r\nIt was a year of financial distress in America, which recalled the hard\r\ntimes of twenty years before. The United States Treasury was empty. There\r\nhad been a too rapid building of railway lines in comparatively undeveloped\r\nregions where they could not pay expenses for years to come. Settlers did\r\nnot come so quickly as was expected, and a fall in railway shares resulted.\r\nThere was great loss, yet the country suffered less than in 1837. During\r\nthe summer the Mormons in Utah gave new trouble. Brigham Young, after Utah\r\nwas excluded from the Union, destroyed the records of the United States\r\ncourts, and practically drove Federal judges from their seats and other\r\nofficials from the Territory. The Mormons now numbered 40,000 members, and\r\nfelt strong enough to defy the government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Mount Meadow]\r\n\r\nIn September, the Indians, believed to have been instigated by the Mormons,\r\nmassacred an immigrant train of 120 persons at Mountain Meadow in Utah.\r\nAlfred Cumming, Superintendent of Indian Affairs on the upper Missouri,\r\ndisplaced Young as Governor of Utah. Judge Eckles of Indiana was appointed\r\nChief-Justice of the Territory. A force of 2,500 men under Colonel A.S.\r\nJohnston was sent to Utah to suppress interference with the laws of the\r\nUnited States. On the arrival of the Federal troops in the autumn, they\r\nwere attacked, on October 6, by the Mormons, their supply trains were\r\ndestroyed, and their oxen driven off. Colonel Johnston was compelled to\r\nfind winter quarters at Fort Bridger.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year a Legislature had met at Topeka, Kansas, and was\r\nimmediately dissolved by the United States marshals. A Territorial\r\nLegislature also met at Lecompton and provided for a State Constitution.\r\nThe people of Kansas utterly refused to recognize the Legislature chosen by\r\nthe Missouri invaders, and both parties continued to hold their elections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quintana]\r\n\r\nManuel José de Quintana, the Spanish playwright and patriotic poet, died on\r\nMarch 11, at Madrid. He was one of the many Spanish writers whose first\r\npoetic inspirations were derived from the stirring incidents of the\r\nPeninsular War. On the return of King Ferdinand VII., Quintana had to\r\nexpiate his liberal sentiments by a term of six years in the prison of\r\nPampeluna. The revolution of 1820 brought about his release, but three\r\nyears later he was banished again from Madrid. An ode on King Ferdinand's\r\nmarriage restored him to royal favor. He was appointed tutor to the Infanta\r\nIsabella, and in 1833 was made Minister of Public Instruction. Two years\r\nbefore his death Queen Isabella publicly crowned the poet with a wreath of\r\nlaurel in the hall of the Cortes. It was a well-merited honor, for the\r\npoet's patriotic odes and ringing lyrics long before this had taken rank\r\namong the finest productions of the modern literature of Spain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jules Breton]\r\n\r\nJules Breton, the famous French pupil of Drolling and of Devigne, exhibited\r\nthis year at Paris one of his greatest works, \"La Bénédiction des Blés.\" It\r\nwas of this picture that Hamerton, the author of \"Painting in France,\"\r\nwrote: \"It is technically a work of singular importance in modern art for\r\nits almost perfect interpretation of sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alfred de Musset]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relations with Georges Sand]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Rolla\" and \"Les Nuits\"]\r\n\r\nAlfred de Musset, the French lyric poet, died on May 1, in Paris. Born in\r\n1810, the scion of an old aristocratic family, he was brought up with the\r\nDuke of Orleans. They remained intimate friends until the Duke's death in\r\n1842. In his eighteenth year De Musset took rank among the romantic writers\r\nof Paris by his first volume of poems--\"Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie.\"\r\nDuring the next two years De Musset published another volume of poems and\r\nthe collection \"Un Spectacle dans un Fauteuil,\" and followed this up with\r\nseveral essays in dramatic verse, published under the title \"Comédies\r\nInjouables.\" In 1833, De Musset went to Italy together with Georges Sand,\r\nbut in Venice the lovers quarrelled and separated. The character of Stenio\r\nin Georges Sand's novel \"Lelia\" was recognized as a personification of De\r\nMusset. Alfred de Musset himself drew on these experiences for his novel\r\n\"Confessions d'un Enfant du Siècle,\" published upon his return from Italy\r\nin 1836. Georges Sand, stung by De Musset's allegations concerning her,\r\ngave her version of their relations in the famous book \"Elle et Lui,\"\r\nwhereupon De Musset's brother Paul published an even less lovely version of\r\nthe affair, in his book \"Lui et Elle.\" During the succeeding year De Musset\r\nbecame one of the foremost contributors to the \"Revue des Deux Mondes.\" In\r\nits pages appeared most of his \"Comédies et Proverbes,\" and the lyric\r\npieces of \"Rolla\" and \"Les Nuits.\" Among his prose tales of this period\r\nwere \"Emmeline,\" \"Les deux Maitresses,\" \"Frédéric et Bernerette,\" and \"Le\r\nFils du Titien.\" Having lost part of his income, the poet was made\r\nlibrarian of the Ministry of the Interior at the instance of the Duke of\r\nOrleans, and as such received an ample pension. After the revolution of\r\n1848 he was deprived of this stipend. Louis Napoleon, on his coronation as\r\nEmperor, restored Alfred de Musset to office and had him elected to the\r\nFrench Academy. During his last years the poet wrote but little verse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: De Musset's pessimism]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Rappelle-toi\"]\r\n\r\nAs a lyric poet, Alfred de Musset claims foremost rank among the modern\r\nwriters of France. His verse, like that of his contemporaries, Byron,\r\nLermontov, Leopardi, Lenau and Heine, is tinged with sadness and pessimism.\r\nLike them, too, he excels in the mastery of the subtile beauties of his\r\nnative tongue. Characteristic of the spirit of his verse, if not of its\r\noutward form, are these lines, translated from his beautiful lyric\r\n\"Rappelle-toi!\"\r\n\r\n  Recall our love when the shy dawn unfoldeth\r\n  The enchanted radiance of the morning sun--\r\n  Recall our love when darkling night beholdeth\r\n  Veiled trains of silvery stars pass one by one,\r\n  When wild thy bosom palpitates with pleasure,\r\n  Or when the shades of night lull thee in dreamy measure;\r\n  Then lend a willing ear\r\n  To murmurings far and near:\r\n  Recall our love!\r\n\r\n  Recall our love when fate hath separated\r\n  Thy heart and mine, estranged for evermore--\r\n  When by the grief of exile ever mated\r\n  The soul is crushed that soared so high before--\r\n  Remember our sad love, remember how we parted--\r\n  Time, absence, grief, are naught for love full-hearted,\r\n  So long as fond hearts beat,\r\n  They ever must repeat:\r\n  Recall our love!\r\n\r\n  Recall our love when under earth reposes\r\n  This heart at last lulled in eternal sleep--\r\n  Recall our love when on my grave dark roses\r\n  In solitude their tender petals weep.\r\n  You will not see me more, but in immortal anguish\r\n  My stricken soul will ever near you languish;\r\n  Under the midnight sky\r\n  A spirit voice will sigh,\r\n  Recall our love!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Les Fleurs de Mal\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baudelaire's Litany]\r\n\r\nDuring this same year in France the pessimism of Alfred de Musset was\r\noutdone by Baudelaire's famous collection of poems \"Les Fleurs de Mal.\"\r\nBaudelaire, as a poet, took a unique place in French literature. Following\r\nin the footsteps of Victor Hugo, and the American, Poe--whose works he was\r\nthe first to translate into French--he outdid both these masters of the\r\ngrotesque in bizarre creations. He was the founder of diabolism in French\r\nletters. As Sainte-Beuve wrote of Baudelaire: \"S'est pris l'enfer et s'est\r\nfait diable.\" The lucubrations of the so-called Satanic School of Byron,\r\nShelley and Hugo were surpassed by Baudelaire's rapt worship of evil as the\r\ngreat power of the world. Take his famous Litany to Satan:\r\n\r\n  O thou the wisest and most beautiful of cherubim,\r\n  A god betrayed by fate and reft of worshipping,\r\n  O Satan, have pity on my endless woe!\r\n\r\n  Thou, who dost save the bones of the old sot\r\n  That reels 'twixt prancing steeds and heeds them not,\r\n  O Satan, have pity on my endless woe!\r\n\r\n  Adopted father of those whom in his rage on high\r\n  The God of Vengeance banished from his paradise,\r\n  O Satan, have pity on my endless woe!\r\n\r\nBaudelaire's worship of evil was genuine, since he cared nothing for any\r\nvirtue save the crowning virtue of artistic excellence. From beginning to\r\nend his \"Fleurs de Mal\" may be said to have blossomed in defiance of all\r\nthat the world has accepted as virtuous. Baudelaire's unusual sense of the\r\ngrotesque is believed to have been fostered by his early voyages in the Far\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Czerny]\r\n\r\nCarl Czerny, the eminent pianist and teacher, died on July 15, at the age\r\nof sixty-six, at his birthplace, Vienna. Czerny while a boy showed rare\r\ntalent for music. He received encouragement from such men as Beethoven,\r\nClementi and Hummel, and began his career as a teacher at sixteen. An early\r\nconcert tour in 1804 had to be given up on account of the wars. The rest of\r\nhis life was spent in Vienna, where he became one of the most influential\r\nteachers. In all he published over a thousand compositions, the most\r\nlasting of which were his pedagogic piano studies. As a musical writer he\r\ngained recognition by a work on the history of music.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Béranger]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The poet's early career]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napoleonic songs]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Béranger in prison]\r\n\r\nOn the day following Czerny's death, Jean Pierre Béranger, the great French\r\nsong writer, died at Paris. He was seventy-seven years old. Little cared\r\nfor by his father, he was brought up by his grandfather, a tailor, who let\r\nhim roam the streets as a gamin. At the age of nine he was sent to act as a\r\ntavern boy for his aunt, who kept a small inn near Peronne in Picardy. In\r\nhis fourteenth year he was apprenticed to a printer, and learned the first\r\nprinciples of versification while setting up the poems of André Chenier. On\r\nhis own behalf he soon printed a small volume of songs entitled \"A Garland\r\nof Roses.\" In 1798, he returned to Paris, and was reclaimed by his father.\r\nFor more than a year he had no settled occupation, during which time he\r\ncomposed some of his best songs. At the outset of the Nineteenth Century,\r\nBéranger definitely determined to follow the career of letters. He wrote a\r\ncomedy, but failing to get it accepted threw it into the fire. Collecting\r\nall his poems he sent them to Lucien Bonaparte, the enlightened brother of\r\nthe First Consul. Prince Lucien took the young poet under his patronage,\r\nbut, unfortunately for Béranger, soon had to leave France, an exile. On\r\nhis arrival at Rome, Lucien Bonaparte transmitted to Béranger the salary\r\ncoming to him as a member of the Institute. As a song writer Béranger made\r\nthe most of his opportunities. In 1809, he was appointed Secretary of the\r\nUniversity of France, an office which he held throughout the Napoleonic\r\nera. In 1813, he became a member of the Jolly Topers of the Caveau, then\r\nthe resort of the most distinguished literary men of Paris. On the fall of\r\nNapoleon, Béranger took it upon himself to sing the glory of the fallen\r\nempire in elegiac strains. A severe reprimand was administered to him by\r\nthe government. His second series of Napoleonic songs, published in 1821,\r\ncost him his place and three months' confinement in the prison of St.\r\nPelagie, while his third (1828) subjected him to nine months' imprisonment\r\nin La Force and a fine of ten thousand francs. The fine was paid by his\r\nadmirers, and the prison in which he was incarcerated became the gathering\r\nplace of the most celebrated literary men of the day. The songs which he\r\ncomposed during this period helped to bring about the revolution of 1830.\r\nBéranger now retired to Passy, then to Fontainebleau, and finally to Tours,\r\nwhere he completed what he called his \"Mémoires Chantantes\" by the\r\npublication of a fourth volume of songs. After the revolution of 1848 he\r\nwas elected to the Constituent Assembly, but soon resigned that post. His\r\ndeclining years were spent at Passy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Comte]\r\n\r\nIsidore Auguste Comte, the metaphysical writer and founder of modern\r\npositive philosophy, died on September 5, at Paris. He was born at\r\nMontpellier in 1798, and became acquainted in his early manhood with\r\nSaint-Simon. Failing to agree with Saint-Simon's doctrines, Comte began to\r\nlecture on his own system of philosophy as early as 1826. In 1849, he gave\r\nreadings on the \"History of Humanity.\" After the _coup d'état_, however,\r\nthe government of Louis Napoleon prohibited the continuance of his\r\nreadings. Comte's teachings are a combination of empiricism and socialism.\r\nThe first of his numerous works was published in 1822--\"Plan of Scientific\r\nWork Necessary for Reorganizing Society.\" Comte's most important work, \"A\r\nCourse of Positive Philosophy,\" was published in six volumes, 1830-1842.\r\nDuring the period of his religious enthusiasm Comte published his \"System\r\nof Positive Politics, or a Treatise of Sociology.\" This was followed by his\r\n\"Positivistic Catechism,\" \"An Appeal to Conservators,\" and \"Subjective\r\nSynthesis.\" In England and America, Comte's works found many illustrious\r\ninterpreters, and congregations adhering to the \"Positivistic Ritual\" were\r\nformed at several places in England. Among his most fervent adherents were\r\nMiss Martineau, R. Congreve, Stuart Mill, Buckle, Lewes, Bridges, Tyler,\r\nand the American, Carey. Positivism also found some noted exponents in\r\nItaly and Germany.",
