In the 21st century, Project Gutenberg would allow anyone\r\nto have a digital library at no cost. Project Gutenberg got its first\r\nboost with the invention of the web in 1990, and its second boost with\r\nthe creation of Distributed Proofreaders in 2000, to share the\r\nproofreading of ebooks between hundreds of volunteers. In 2010, Project\r\nGutenberg offered more than 33,000 high-quality ebooks being downloaded\r\nby the tens of thousands every day, and websites in the United States,\r\nin Australia, in Europe, and in Canada, with 40 mirror sites worldwide.\r\n\r\nThis trilingual (English, Spanish, French) ebook is meant to celebrate\r\nthe 40th anniversary of Project Gutenberg, with four parts:\r\n# Project Gutenberg is 40 years old\r\n# From the past to the future\r\n# Project Gutenberg and languages\r\n# Distributed Proofreaders is 10 years old\r\n\r\nAbout the author > Marie Lebert is a researcher and journalist\r\nspecializing in technology for books and languages. Her books are\r\nfreely available in Project Gutenberg <www.gutenberg.org> and in\r\nManyBooks.net <http://manybooks.net>, in various formats for any\r\nelectronic device (computer, PDA, mobile phone, smartphone, ebook\r\nreader).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMARIO [ES]\r\n\r\n\r\nEl primer libro digital remonta al 4 de julio de 1971. Se trata del\r\neText #1 del Proyecto Gutenberg, un proyecto visionario lanzado por\r\nMichael Hart con el fin de crear versiones electronicas gratuitas de\r\nobras literarias y de difundirlas por el mundo entero. En el siglo 16,\r\nGutenberg habia hecho posible para todos tener libros impresos por un\r\nprecio relativamente modico. En el siglo 21, el Proyecto Gutenberg iba\r\na permitir a cada uno disponer de una biblioteca digital gratuita. Este\r\nproyecto cobra nuevo aliento y alcanzo una difusion internacional con\r\nla aparicion de la web en 1990, y luego con la creacion de Distributed\r\nProofreaders en 2000, cuya meta es compartir la revision de los libros\r\nentre centenares de voluntarios. En 2010, el Proyecto Gutenberg cuenta\r\ncon mas de 33.000 ebooks de alta calidad y decenas de milles de\r\ndescargas al dia. Tiene sitios web en los Estados Unidos, en Australia,\r\nen Europa y en Canada, con 40 sitios espejo repartidos por todo el\r\nplaneta.\r\n\r\nEste ebook trilinguee (ingles, espanol, frances) tiene como meta\r\ncelebrar los 40 anos del Proyecto Gutenberg, con quatro partes:\r\n# El Proyecto Gutenberg tiene 40 anos\r\n# Desde el pasado hacia el futuro\r\n# El Proyecto Gutenberg y los idiomas\r\n# Distributed Proofreaders tiene 10 anos\r\n\r\nSobre la autora > Marie Lebert, investigadora y periodista, se interesa\r\npor las tecnologias para el libro y los idiomas. Sus libros estan\r\ndisponibles gratuitamente en el Proyecto Gutenberg <www.gutenberg.org>\r\ny en ManyBooks.net <http://manybooks.net>, en varios formatos para\r\nlectura en un ordenador, un PDA, un telefono movil, un smartphone o una\r\ntableta. Muchas gracias a Anna Alvarez por su ayuda para varios textos\r\nen espanol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMMAIRE [FR]\r\n\r\n\r\nLe premier livre numerique date du 4 juillet 1971. Il s'agit de l'eText\r\n#1 du Projet Gutenberg, un projet visionnaire lance par Michael Hart\r\npour creer des versions electroniques gratuites d'oeuvres litteraires\r\net les diffuser dans le monde entier. Au 16e siecle, Gutenberg avait\r\npermis a chacun d'avoir des livres imprimes pour un prix relativement\r\nmodique. Au 21e siecle, le Projet Gutenberg permettrait a chacun\r\nd'avoir une bibliotheque numerique gratuite. Ce projet trouve un second\r\nsouffle et un rayonnement international avec l'apparition du web en\r\n1990, puis la creation de Distributed Proofreaders en 2000 pour\r\npartager la relecture des livres entre des centaines de volontaires. En\r\n2010, le Projet Gutenberg compte plus de 33.000 ebooks de grande\r\nqualite ainsi que des dizaines de milliers de telechargements par jour.\r\nIl dispose de sites web aux Etats-Unis, en Australie, en Europe et au\r\nCanada, avec 40 sites miroirs repartis sur toute la planete.\r\n\r\nCet ebook trilingue (anglais, espagnol, francais) a pour but de\r\ncelebrer les 40 ans du Projet Gutenberg, avec quatre parties:\r\n# Le Projet Gutenberg a 40 ans\r\n# Du passe vers l'avenir\r\n# Le Projet Gutenberg et les langues\r\n# Distributed Proofreaders a 10 ans\r\n\r\nAu sujet de l'auteure > Marie Lebert, chercheuse et journaliste,\r\ns'interesse aux technologies pour le livre et les langues. Ses livres\r\nsont librement disponibles dans le Projet Gutenberg <www.gutenberg.org>\r\net dans ManyBooks.net <http://manybooks.net>, dans divers formats\r\npermettant leur lecture sur tout appareil electronique (ordinateur,\r\nPDA, telephone mobile, smartphone et tablette).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT GUTENBERG IS 40 YEARS OLD [EN]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 16th century, Gutenberg allowed anyone to have print books for a\r\nsmall cost. In the 21st century, Project Gutenberg would allow anyone\r\nto have a digital library at no cost.\r\n\r\n# Beginning\r\n\r\nAs recalled by Michael Hart in January 2009 in an email interview: \"On\r\nJuly 4, 1971, while still a freshman at the University of Illinois\r\n(UI), I decided to spend the night at the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at\r\nthe UI Materials Research Lab, rather than walk miles home in the\r\nsummer heat, only to come back hours later to start another day of\r\nschool. I stopped on the way to do a little grocery shopping to get\r\nthrough the night, and day, and along with the groceries they put in\r\nthe faux parchment copy of The U.S. Declaration of Independence that\r\nbecame quite literally the cornerstone of Project Gutenberg. That\r\nnight, as it turned out, I received my first computer account - I had\r\nbeen hitchhiking on my brother's best friend's name, who ran the\r\ncomputer on the night shift. When I got a first look at the huge amount\r\nof computer money I was given, I decided I had to do something\r\nextremely worthwhile to do justice to what I had been given. This was\r\nsuch a serious, and intense thought process for a college freshman, my\r\nfirst thought was that I had better eat something to get up enough\r\nenergy to think of something worthwhile enough to repay the cost of all\r\nthat computer time. As I emptied out groceries, the faux parchment\r\nDeclaration of Independence fell out, and the light literally went on\r\nover my head like in the cartoons and comics... I knew what the future\r\nof computing, and the internet, was going to be... 'The Information\r\nAge.' The rest, as they say, is history.\"\r\n\r\nMichael keyed in The United States Declaration of Independence to the\r\nmainframe he was using, in upper case, because there was no lower case\r\nyet. The file was 5 K. To send a 5 K file to the 100 users of the pre-\r\ninternet of the time would have crashed the network, so Michael\r\nmentioned where the etext was stored - though without a hypertext link,\r\nbecause the web was still 20 years ahead. It was downloaded by six\r\nusers. Project Gutenberg was born.\r\n\r\nMichael decided to use the huge amount of computer time he had been\r\ngiven to search the literary works that were stored in libraries, and\r\nto digitize these works. A book would become a continuous text file\r\ninstead of a set of pages. Project Gutenberg's mission would be the\r\nfollowing: to put at everyone's disposal, in electronic versions, as\r\nmany literary works as possible for free.\r\n\r\nAfter keying in The United States Declaration of Independence (signed\r\non July 4, 1776) in 1971, Michael typed in a longer text, The United\r\nStates Bill of Rights, in 1972, i.e. the first ten amendments added in\r\n1789 to the Constitution (dated 1787) and defining the individual\r\nrights of the citizens and the distinct powers of the federal\r\ngovernment and the States. A volunteer typed in The United States\r\nConstitution in 1973.\r\n\r\nFrom one year to the next, disk space was getting larger, by the\r\nstandards of the time - there was no hard disk yet -, making it\r\npossible to store larger files.\r\n\r\nVolunteers began typing in The Bible, with one individual book at a\r\ntime, and a file for each book.\r\n\r\nMichael typed in the collected works of Shakespeare, with volunteers,\r\none play at a time, and a file for each play. This edition of\r\nShakespeare was never released, unfortunately, due to changes in\r\ncopyright law. Shakespeare's works belong to public domain, but\r\ncomments and notes may be copyrighted, depending on the publication\r\ndate. Other editions of Shakespeare from public domain were released a\r\nfew years later.\r\n\r\n# 10 to 1,000 ebooks\r\n\r\nIts critics long considered Project Gutenberg as impossible on a large\r\nscale. But Michael went on keying book after book during many years,\r\nwith the help of some volunteers.\r\n\r\nIn August 1989, Project Gutenberg completed its 10th ebook, The King\r\nJames Bible (1769), both testaments, and 5M for all files.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, there were 250,000 internet users. The web was in its infancy.\r\nThe standard was 360 K disks.\r\n\r\nIn January 1991, Michael typed in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\r\n(1865), by Lewis Carroll. In July 1991, he typed in Peter Pan (1904),\r\nby James M. Barrie. These two classics of childhood literature each fit\r\non one disk.\r\n\r\nThe first browser, Mosaic, was released in November 1993. It became\r\neasier to circulate etexts and recruit volunteers. From 1991 to 1996,\r\nthe number of ebooks doubled every year, with one ebook per month in\r\n1991, two ebooks per month in 1992, four ebooks per month in 1993, and\r\neight ebooks per month in 1994.\r\n\r\nIn January 1994, Project Gutenberg released The Complete Works of\r\nWilliam Shakespeare as eBook #100. Shakespeare wrote most of his works\r\nbetween 1590 and 1613.\r\n\r\nThe steady growth went on, with an average of 8 ebooks per month in\r\n1994, 16 ebooks per month in 1995, and 32 ebooks per month in 1996.\r\n\r\nIn June 1997, Project Gutenberg released The Merry Adventures of Robin\r\nHood (1883), by Howard Pyle.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg reached 1,000 ebooks in August 1997. EBook #1000 was\r\nLa Divina Commedia (1321), by Dante Alighieri, in Italian, its original\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWith the number of ebooks on the rise, three main sections were set up:\r\n(a) \"Light Literature\", such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\r\nThrough the Looking-Glass, Peter Pan and Aesop's Fables; (b) \"Heavy\r\nLiterature\", such as the Bible, Shakespeare's works, Moby Dick and\r\nParadise Lost; (c) \"Reference Literature\", such as Roget's Thesaurus,\r\nalmanacs, and a set of encyclopedias and dictionaries. (A more detailed\r\nclassification was created later on.)\r\n\r\n\"Light Literature\" was the main section in number of ebooks. As\r\nexplained on the website in 1998: \"The Light Literature Collection is\r\ndesigned to get persons to the computer in the first place, whether the\r\nperson may be a pre-schooler or a great-grandparent. We love it when we\r\nhear about kids or grandparents taking each other to an etext of Peter\r\nPan when they come back from watching Hook at the movies, or when they\r\nread Alice in Wonderland after seeing it on TV. We have also been told\r\nthat nearly every Star Trek movie has quoted current Project Gutenberg\r\netext releases (from Moby Dick in The Wrath of Khan; a Peter Pan quote\r\nfinishing up the most recent, etc.) not to mention a reference to\r\nThrough the Looking-Glass in JFK. This was a primary concern when we\r\nchose the books for our libraries. We want people to be able to look up\r\nquotations they heard in conversation, movies, music, other books,\r\neasily with a library containing all these quotations in an easy-to-\r\nfind etext format.\"\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg's goal is more about selecting books intended for the\r\ngeneral public than providing authoritative editions. As explained on\r\nthe website in 1998: \"We do not write for the reader who cares whether\r\na certain phrase in Shakespeare has a ':' or a ';' between its clauses.\r\nWe put our sights on a goal to release etexts that are 99.9% accurate\r\nin the eyes of the general reader. Given the preferences our\r\nproofreaders have, and the general lack of reading ability the public\r\nis currently reported to have, we probably exceed those requirements by\r\na significant amount. However, for the person who wants an\r\n'authoritative edition' we will have to wait some time until this\r\nbecomes more feasible. We do, however, intend to release many editions\r\nof Shakespeare and the other classics for comparative study on a\r\nscholarly level.\"\r\n\r\nThe etexts, later called ebooks, were stored in the simplest way, using\r\nthe low set of ASCII, called Plain Vanilla ASCII, for them to be read\r\non any hardware and software. As a text file, a book could be easily\r\ncopied, indexed, searched, analyzed, and compared with other books.\r\n\r\nAs explained by Michael Hart in August 1998 in an email interview: \"We\r\nconsider etext to be a new medium, with no real relationship to paper,\r\nother than presenting the same material, but I don't see how paper can\r\npossibly compete once people each find their own comfortable way to\r\netexts, especially in schools. (...) My own personal goal is to put\r\n10,000 etexts on the net [this goal was reached in October 2003] and if\r\nI can get some major support, I would like to expand that to 1,000,000\r\nand to also expand our potential audience for the average etext from\r\n1.x% of the world population to over 10%, thus changing our goal from\r\ngiving away 1,000,000,000,000 etexts to 1,000 times as many, a trillion\r\nand a quadrillion in U.S. terminology.\"\r\n\r\n# 1,000 to 10,000 ebooks\r\n\r\nFrom 1998 to 2000, the \"output\" was an average of 36 new ebooks per\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg reached 2,000 ebooks in May 1999. EBook #2000 was Don\r\nQuijote (1605), by Cervantes, in Spanish, its original language.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders was launched in October 2000 by Charles Franks\r\nto share the proofreading of ebooks between many volunteers. Volunteers\r\nchoose one of the digitized books available on the website and\r\nproofread a given page, or several pages, as they wish.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg reached 3,000 ebooks in December 2000. EBook #3000\r\nwas A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (In the Shadow of Young Girls\r\nin Flower), vol. 3 (1919), by Marcel Proust, in French, its original\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg Australia was launched in August 2001.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg reached 4,000 ebooks in October 2001. EBook #4000 was\r\nThe French Immortals Series (1905), in English. This book is an\r\nanthology of short fictions by authors from the French Academy\r\n(Academie Francaise): Emile Souvestre, Pierre Loti, Hector Malot,\r\nCharles de Bernard, Alphonse Daudet, and others.\r\n\r\nThe output in 2001 was an average of 104 new ebooks per month.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg reached 5,000 ebooks in April 2002. EBook #5000 was\r\nThe Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, an English version of Leonardo's\r\nearly 16th-century writings in Italian. Since its release, this ebook\r\nhas constantly stayed in the Top 100 of downloaded ebooks.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, Michael Hart chose to type in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\r\nand Peter Pan because they would each fit on one 360 K disk, the\r\nstandard of the time. In 2002, the standard disk was 1.44 M and could\r\nbe compressed as a zipped file.\r\n\r\nA practical file size is about 3 million characters, more than long\r\nenough for the average book. The ASCII version of a 300-page novel is 1\r\nM. A bulky book can fit in two ASCII files, that can be downloaded as\r\nis or zipped. An average of 50 hours is necessary to get an ebook\r\nselected, copyright-cleared, scanned, proofread, formatted, and\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nA few numbers are reserved for \"special\" books. For example, eBook\r\n#1984 is reserved for George Orwell's classic, published in 1949, and\r\nstill a long way from falling into public domain.\r\n\r\nIn spring 2002, Project Gutenberg's ebooks represented 25% of all the\r\npublic domain works freely available on the web and listed in the\r\nInternet Public Library (IPL). The output in 2002 was an average of 203\r\nnew ebooks per month.\r\n\r\nIn November 2002, Project Gutenberg released the 75 files of the Human\r\nGenome Project, with files of dozens or hundreds of megabytes, shortly\r\nafter its initial release in February 2001 as a work from public\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\n1,000 ebooks in August 1997, 2,000 ebooks in May 1999, 3,000 ebooks in\r\nDecember 2000, 4,000 ebooks in October 2001, 5,000 ebooks in April\r\n2002, 10,000 ebooks in October 2003. EBook #10000 was The Magna Carta,\r\nsigned in 1215 and known as the first English constitutional text.\r\n\r\nFrom April 2002 to October 2003, in 18 months, the collection of ebooks\r\ndoubled, going from 5,000 ebooks to 10,000 ebooks, with a monthly\r\naverage of 348 new ebooks in 2003. The fast growth was the work of\r\nDistributed Proofreaders, a website launched in October 2000 to share\r\nthe proofreading of ebooks between many volunteers.\r\n\r\nEBooks were also copied on CDs and DVDs. As blank CDs and DVDs cost\r\nnext to nothing, Project Gutenberg began burning and sending a free CD\r\nor DVD to anyone asking for it. People were encouraged to make copies\r\nfor a friend, a library or a school. Released in August 2003, the Best\r\nof Gutenberg CD contained 600 ebooks. The first Project Gutenberg DVD\r\nwas released in December 2003 to celebrate the first 10,000 ebooks,\r\nwith the burning of most titles (9,400 ebooks).\r\n\r\nIn September 2003, Project Gutenberg launched Project Gutenberg Audio\r\neBooks, a  collection of human-read ebooks, as well as the Sheet Music\r\nSubproject, a collection of digitized music sheet and music recordings.\r\nA collection of still and moving pictures was also available.\r\n\r\n# 10,000 to 20,000 ebooks\r\n\r\nIn December 2003, there were 11,000 ebooks, which represented 110 G, in\r\nseveral formats (ASCII, HTML, PDF, and others, as is or zipped). In May\r\n2004, there were 12,600 ebooks, which represented 135 G. With more than\r\n300 new ebooks added per month (338 ebooks per month in 2004), the\r\nnumber of gigabytes was expected to double every year.\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC) was affiliated with\r\nProject Gutenberg in 2003, and became an official Project Gutenberg\r\nsite. Since 1997, PGCC had been working on gathering collections of\r\nexisting ebooks, as a complement to Project Gutenberg working on\r\nproducing ebooks. As explained by Michael Hart in February 2009: \"The\r\nProject Gutenberg Consortia Center has over 75,000 ebooks rendered as\r\nPDF files, and some are really quite stunning. The difference? These\r\nfiles were prepared by other eLibraries, not Project Gutenberg, and are\r\nusing our worldwide distribution network to be seen.\"\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Project Rastko, based in Belgrade, Serbia, launched Project\r\nGutenberg Europe (PG Europe) and Distributed Proofreaders Europe (DP\r\nEurope) in January 2004. 100 ebooks were available in June 2005, in\r\nseveral languages, as a reflection of European linguistic diversity.\r\n\r\nIn January 2005, Project Gutenberg reached 15,000 ebooks. EBook #15000\r\nwas The Life of Reason (1906), by George Santayana.\r\n\r\nWhat about languages? There were ebooks in 25 languages in February\r\n2004, and in 42 languages in July 2005, including Sanskrit and the\r\nMayan languages. The seven main languages - with more than 50 ebooks -\r\nwere English (with 14,548 ebooks on July 27, 2005), French (577\r\nebooks), German (349 ebooks), Finnish (218 ebooks), Dutch (130 ebooks),\r\nSpanish (103 ebooks), and Chinese (69 ebooks).\r\n\r\nIn July 2005, Project Gutenberg Australia (launched in August 2001)\r\nreached 500 ebooks.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg PrePrints was launched in January 2006 to collect\r\nitems submitted to Project Gutenberg which were interesting enough to\r\nbe available online, but not ready yet to be added to the main Project\r\nGutenberg collection, because of missing data, low-quality files,\r\nformats which were not handy, etc. 379 ebooks were available in\r\nDecember 2006, and 2,020 ebooks in February 2009.\r\n\r\nIn December 2006, Project Gutenberg reached 20,000 ebooks. EBook #20000\r\nwas the audiobook of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Vingt mille\r\nlieues sous les mers, 1869), by Jules Verne, in its English version.\r\n\r\nIf 32 years and 3 months, from July 1971 to October 2003, were\r\nnecessary to produce the first 10,000 ebooks, 3 years and 2 months,\r\nfrom October 2003 to December 2006, were necessary to produce the\r\nfollowing 10,000 ebooks. There were ebooks in 50 languages in December\r\n2006.\r\n\r\n# 20,000 to 30,000 ebooks\r\n\r\nIn December 2006, Mike Cook launched the blog Project Gutenberg News as\r\n\"the news portal for gutenberg.org\", to complement the existing weekly\r\nand monthly newsletters. For example, the blog gave a table of the\r\nweekly, monthly and yearly production numbers since 2001.\r\n\r\nThe weekly production was 24 ebooks in 2001, 47 ebooks in 2002, 79\r\nebooks in 2003, 78 ebooks in 2004, 58 ebooks in 2005, and 80 ebooks in\r\n2006.\r\n\r\nThe monthly production was 104 ebooks in 2001, 203 ebooks in 2002, 348\r\nebooks in 2003, 338 ebooks in 2004, 252 ebooks in 2005, and 345 ebooks\r\nin 2006.\r\n\r\nThe yearly production was 1,244 ebooks in 2001, 2,432 ebooks in 2002,\r\n4,176 ebooks in 2003, 4,058 ebooks in 2004, 3,019 ebooks in 2005, and\r\n4,141 ebooks in 2006.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg Australia reached 1,500 ebooks in April 2007.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg Canada (PGC) was launched on July 1st, 2007, on\r\nCanada Day, by Michael Shepard and David Jones. Distributed\r\nProofreaders Canada (DPC) started production in December 2007. There\r\nwere 100 ebooks in March 2008, in English, French, and Italian.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg sent out 15 million ebooks via CDs and DVDs by snail\r\nmail in 2007. The latest DVD (released in July 2006) included 17,000\r\nebooks. CD and DVD files were also generated as ISO files (since 2005)\r\nto be downloaded for burning CDs or DVDs.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg reached 25,000 books in April 2008. EBook #25000 was\r\nEnglish Book Collectors (1902), by William Younger Fletcher.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg reached 30,000 books in October 2009. EBook #30000\r\nwas The Bird Book (1915), by Chester Albert Reed.\r\n\r\n# 30,000 ebooks onwards\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders celebrated its 10th anniversary in October\r\n2010, with more than 18,000 books digitized and proofread during ten\r\nyears by thousands of volunteeers.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg offered more than 33,000 high-quality proofread\r\nebooks in December 2010, in various formats for any electronic device\r\n(computer, PDA, mobile phone, smartphone, and ebook reader).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL PROYECTO GUTENBERG TIENE 40 ANOS [ES]\r\n\r\n\r\nEn el siglo 16, Gutenberg habia hecho posible para todos tener libros\r\nimpresos por un precio relativamente modico. En el siglo 21, el\r\nProyecto Gutenberg iba a permitir a cada uno disponer de una biblioteca\r\ndigital gratuita.\r\n\r\n# Gestacion\r\n\r\n?Cuales son las raices del proyecto? Cuando Michael Hart estudia en la\r\nUniversidad de Illinois (Estados Unidos), el laboratorio informatico de\r\nsu universidad le asigna millones de dolares de tiempo de ordenador.\r\n\r\nEl 4 de julio de 1971, dia de la fiesta nacional, Michael digita The\r\nUnited States Declaration of Independence (Declaracion de independencia\r\nde los Estados Unidos), en mayusculas, pues las letras minusculas aun\r\nno existan. El texto electronico representa 5 K (kilobytes).\r\n\r\nEl envio de un archivo de 5 K a las cien personas que forman el pre-\r\ninternet de la epoca haya acabado con el sistema, provocando su\r\nimplosion, porque el ancho de banda aun es infimo.\r\n\r\nMichael difunde un mensaje que explica donde se almacena el texto - aun\r\nsin enlace hipertexto, pues habria que esperar unos 20 anos mas para la\r\nweb - y seis personas descargan este archivo.\r\n\r\nSobre la marcha, Michael decide dedicar ese enorme credito de tiempo a\r\nla busqueda de obras literarias disponibles en bibliotecas, y a la\r\ndigitalizacion de estas.  El conjunto de paginas encuadernadas, forma\r\ntradicional del libro, iba a convertirse en un texto electronico que se\r\npuede desplegar de par en par.\r\n\r\nPoco despues, Michael define asi la mision del Proyecto Gutenberg:\r\nponer a disposicion de todos, por via electronica, el mayor numero\r\nposible de obras literarias gratuitamente.\r\n\r\nTras haber digitado The United States Declaration of Independence\r\n(Declaracion de independencia de los Estados Unidos, firmada el 4 de\r\njulio de 1776) en 1971, Michael prosigue con sus esfuerzos en 1972\r\ndigitando The United States Bill of Rights  (Declaracion de derechos de\r\nlos Estados Unidos). Esa declaracion incluye las diez primeras\r\nenmiendas anadidas en 1789 a la Constitucion de los Estados Unidos\r\n(ratificada en 1787), y define los derechos individuales de los\r\nciudadanos y los poderes respectivos del gobierno federal y de los\r\nEstados. En 1973, un voluntario digita The United States Constitution\r\n(Constitucion de los\r\nEstados Unidos) en su totalidad.\r\n\r\nEl internet, aun embrionario en 1971, despega verdaderamente en 1974,\r\ntras la creacion del protocolo TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol /\r\nInternet Protocol).\r\n\r\nAno tras ano, la capacidad del disquete aumenta con regularidad - el\r\ndisco duro no existe aun - de modo que los archivos pueden ocupar cada\r\nvez mas espacio. Algunos voluntarios se animan a digitalizar La Biblia,\r\ncompuesta de varios libros, cada cual puede tratarse por separado y\r\nocupar un archivo diferente.\r\n\r\nMichael tambien empieza a digitar la obra completa de Shakespeare, con\r\nla ayuda de voluntarios, una obra de teatro tras otra, cada una en un\r\narchivo. De hecho aquella edicion nunca se puede poner en linea, debido\r\na que, entre tanto, entra en vigor una ley de copyright mas rigurosa,\r\nya no destinada a proteger el texto de Shakespeare, pasado desde hace\r\ntiempo al dominio publico, sino los comentarios y notas de aquella\r\nedicion. Otras ediciones anotadas que si han pasado al dominio publico\r\nse ponen en linea algunos anos mas tarde.\r\n\r\n# De 10 a 1.000 ebooks\r\n\r\nEn agosto de 1989, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea su decimo texto,\r\nThe King James Bible, una biblia publicada por primera vez en 1611 y\r\ncuya version mas conocida es la de 1769. El conjunto de los archivos\r\ndel Antiguo Testamento y del Nuevo Testamento representa 5 M\r\n(megabytes).\r\n\r\nEn 1990, ya hay 250.000 internautas, y el modelo estandar vigente es el\r\ndisquete de 360 K (kilobytes).\r\n\r\nEn enero de 1991, Michael digita Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\r\n(Alicia en el pais de las maravillas, 1865) de Lewis Carroll. En julio\r\ndel mismo ano, digita Peter Pan (1904) de James M. Barrie. Cada uno de\r\nestos dos clasicos de la literatura infantil cabe en un disquete\r\nestandar.\r\n\r\nLuego llega la web, operativa a partir de 1991. El primer navegador,\r\nMosaic, aparece en noviembre de 1993. Al generalizarse el acceso a la\r\nred, resulta mas facil hacer circular los textos electronicos y\r\nreclutar voluntarios.\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg perfecciona su metodo de trabajo, y logra\r\ndigitalizar un texto al mes en 1991, dos textos al mes en 1992, cuatro\r\ntextos al mes en 1993 y ocho textos al mes en 1994.\r\n\r\nEn enero de 1994, el Proyecto Gutenberg celebra su eBook #100 con la\r\npuesta en linea de The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (La obra\r\ncompleta de William Shakespeare). Shakespeare escribio la mayor parte\r\nde su obra entre 1590 y 1613.\r\n\r\nA continuacion la produccion sigue aumentando, con una media de 8\r\nebooks al mes en 1994, 16 ebooks al mes en 1995 y 32 ebooks al mes en\r\n1996.\r\n\r\nEntre 1991 y 1996, la produccion se ha duplicado cada ano. Mientras\r\nsigue con la digitalizacion de los libros, Michael coordina tambien a\r\npartir de entonces el trabajo de decenas de voluntarios.\r\n\r\nEn 1997, la produccion sigue siendo de 32 ebooks al mes. En junio de\r\n1997, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea The Merry Adventures of Robin\r\nHood (Las alegres aventuras de Robin Hood, 1883) de Howard Pyle. En\r\nagosto de 1997, se pone en linea el eBook #1000, La Divina Commedia (La\r\nDivina Comedia, 1321) de Dante Alighieri, en su idioma original, el\r\nitaliano.\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg se articula en torno a tres grandes sectores: (a)\r\n\"Light Literature\"(literatura de entretenimiento), que incluye por\r\nejemplo Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Las aventuras de Alicia en el\r\npais de las maravillas), Peter Pan o Aesop's Fables (Las Fabulas de\r\nEsopo); (b) \"Heavy Literature\" (literatura \"seria\"), que incluye por\r\nejemplo La Biblia, las obras de Shakespeare o Moby Dick; (c) \"Reference\r\nLiterature\" (literatura de referencia), que reune enciclopedias y\r\ndiccionarios, por ejemplo el Roget's Thesaurus. Mas adelante, esta\r\npresentacion en tres sectores es sustituida por una clasificacion\r\ndetallada con mas secciones.\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg pretende ser universal, tanto a nivel de las\r\nobras que selecciona como del publico al que se dirige, ya que la meta\r\nes poner la literatura a disposicion de todos, sin limitarse al publico\r\nhabitual de estudiantes y docentes.\r\n\r\nEl sector dedicado a la literatura de entretenimiento se propone atraer\r\nfrente a la pantalla a un publico muy diverso, por ejemplo a ninos y a\r\nsus abuelos en busca del texto electronico de Peter Pan despues de\r\nhaber visto la pelicula Hook, de la version electronica de Alicia en el\r\npais de las maravillas tras haber visto una adaptacion televisiva, o\r\ndel origen de una cita literaria tras visionar un episodio de Star\r\nTrek. En casi todos los episodios de Star Trek se citan libros\r\ndisponibles en version digital en el Proyecto Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nEl objetivo, entonces, es que el publico, este o no este acostumbrado\r\nal contacto con el libro impreso, pueda encontrar con facilidad los\r\ntextos escuchados en conversaciones, peliculas, musicas, o leidos en\r\notros libros, periodicos y revistas.\r\n\r\nLos textos electronicos (llamados tambien \"etexts\" o \"ebooks\") estan\r\nalmacenados bajo la forma mas sencilla posible, en formato ASCII\r\n(American Standard Code for Information Interchange - Codigo\r\nEstadounidense Estandar para el Intercambio de Informacion), para que\r\nesos textos pudieran ser leidos sin problema con cualquier plataforma y\r\nsoftware. Los terminos escritos en cursiva o en negrita y los terminos\r\nsubrayados en la version impresa estan en letras capitales. Los\r\narchivos ASCII no ocupan mucho espacio y se pueden descargar\r\nfacilmente. La busqueda textual es igual de sencilla. Basta con\r\nutilizar la funcion \"buscar\" presente en cualquier software.\r\n\r\nMichael Hart explica en agosto de 1998 en una entrevista por correo\r\nelectronico: \"Nosotros consideramos el texto electronico como un nuevo\r\nmedio de comunicacion, sin verdadera relacion con el papel. La unica\r\nsemejanza es que ambos difundimos las mismas obras, pero en cuanto la\r\ngente se haya acostumbrado, no veo como el papel aun podria competir\r\ncon el texto electronico, sobre todo en las escuelas. ... Mi proyecto\r\nes cargar 10.000 textos electronicos en el internet [esta meta se\r\nalcanza en octubre de 2003]. Si pudiera conseguir subvenciones mas\r\nimportantes, me gustaria llegar hasta un millon y ampliar tambien el\r\nnumero de nuestros usuarios potenciales pasando de un 1,x% a un 10% de\r\nla poblacion mundial, lo que representaria la distribucion de 1.000\r\nveces un billon de textos electronicos en lugar de un solo billon.\"\r\n\r\n# De 1.000 a 10.000 ebooks\r\n\r\nEntre 1998 y 2000, la produccion sigue constante, con una media de 36\r\nnuevos ebooks al mes. En mayo de 1999, las colecciones cuentan con\r\n2.000 libros digitales. El eBook #2000 es Don Quijote (publicado en\r\n1605), en castellano.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders (DP) es lanzado en octubre de 2000 por Charles\r\nFranks para repartir la correccion de las obras entre varias personas.\r\nLos voluntarios eligen uno de los libros digitales disponibles en el\r\nsitio web para releer y corregir determinada pagina. Cada cual trabaja\r\na su ritmo. A titulo indicativo, se aconseja repasar una pagina al dia.\r\nRepresenta poco tiempo en un dia, pero mucho para el proyecto.\r\n\r\nDisponible en diciembre del ano 2000, el eBook #3000 es el tercer\r\nvolumen de A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (A la sombra de las\r\nmuchachas en flor, 1919) de Marcel Proust, en su idioma original, el\r\nfrances. La media pasa a 104 nuevos ebooks al mes en 2001.\r\n\r\nEl Project Gutenberg Australia es lanzado en agosto de 2001.\r\n\r\nDisponible en octubre de 2001, el eBook #4000 es The French Immortals\r\nSeries (Obras de los Inmortales franceses), en version inglesa.\r\nPublicado en 1905 por la Maison Mazarin (Paris), este libro reune\r\nvarias ficciones de escritores laureados por la Academia de la Lengua\r\nFrancesa (Academie Francaise), como Emile Souvestre, Pierre Loti,\r\nHector Malot, Charles de Bernard, Alphonse Daudet y otros.\r\n\r\nDisponible en abril de 2002, el eBook #5000 es The Notebooks of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci (Los cuadernos de Leonardo da Vinci), que datan de\r\ninicios de siglo 16, en una traduccion del italiano al ingles. En 2010,\r\neste texto aun se encuentra en el Top 100 de los libros descargados con\r\nmas frecuencia.\r\n\r\nEn 1991, Michael Hart decidio digitalizar Alice's Adventures in\r\nWonderland o Peter Pan porque su version digital cupo en un disquete de\r\n360 K (kilobytes), o sea el estandar de la epoca. Quince anos mas\r\ntarde, en 2002, ya disponemos de disquetes de 1,44 M (megabytes) con la\r\nposibilidad de comprimir archivos en archivos ZIP. Un archivo estandar\r\npuede contener tres millones de caracteres, o sea mas de los necesarios\r\npara un libro de tamano mediano, ya que una novela de 300 paginas\r\ndigitalizada en formato ASCII representa 1 M (megabyte). Un libro\r\nvoluminoso cabe en dos archivos ASCII, descargables en version normal o\r\nen version comprimida en un archivo ZIP.\r\n\r\nSe necesitan unas cincuenta horas para seleccionar un libro de tamano\r\nmediano, comprobar que ha pasado al dominio publico, escanearlo,\r\ncorregirlo, formatearlo y compaginarlo.\r\n\r\nAlgunos numeros de libros se reservan para mas tarde, por ejemplo el\r\nnumero 1984 (eBook #1984) para la novela eponima de George Orwell,\r\npublicada en 1949, que aun esta lejos de pasar al dominio publico.\r\n\r\nAl llegar la primavera de 2002, ya cubren un cuarto de las obras del\r\ndominio publico de libre acceso en la web, inventariadas de forma casi\r\nexhaustiva por la Internet Public Library (IPL - Biblioteca Publica del\r\nInternet), un buen resultado que es el fruto del trabajo paciente de\r\nmiles de voluntarios activos en numerosos paises. En 2002, las\r\ncolecciones se amplian de 203 nuevos ebooks al mes.\r\n\r\nEn noviembre de 2002, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea los 75\r\narchivos del Human Genome Project (Proyecto del Genoma Humano, es saber\r\nla secuenciacion del genoma humano), poco tiempo despues de su\r\npublicacion inicial en febrero de 2001, debido a que desde el principio\r\nya pertenecia al dominio publico. Cada archivo se compone de decenas, o\r\nincluso de cientos de megabytes.\r\n\r\n1.000 ebooks en agosto de 1997, 2.000 ebooks en mayo de 1999, 3.000\r\nebooks en diciembre de 2000, 4.000 ebooks en octubre de 2001, 5.000\r\nebooks en abril de 2002, 10.000 ebooks en octubre de 2003. El eBook\r\n#10.000 es The Magna Carta, que fue el primer texto constitucional\r\ningles, firmado en 1215.\r\n\r\nEntre abril de 2002 y octubre de 2003, las colecciones se duplican,\r\npasando de 5.000 a 10.000 libros digitales en 18 meses. En 2003, la\r\nproduccion es de unos 348 nuevos ebooks al mes. Este crecimiento rapido\r\nse debe a la actividad de Distributed Proofreaders (DP), concebido en\r\noctubre de 2000 para repartir la correccion de las obras entre muchos\r\nvoluntarios.\r\n\r\nEn agosto de 2003, se pone a disposicion un CD Best of Gutenberg con\r\nuna seleccion de 600 ebooks. En diciembre de 2003, fecha en la que el\r\nProyecto Gutenberg alcanza la cifra de 10.000 libros digitales, se\r\ngraba en un DVD la casi totalidad de los ebooks (9.400 ebooks). Se\r\nenvian gratuitamente el CD y el DVD a cualquier persona que lo pida.\r\nLuego cada uno queda libre de realizar todas las copias que pueda y de\r\ndistribuirlas a su alrededor en escuelas y bibliotecas.\r\n\r\nEn septiembre de 2003, el Proyecto Gutenberg lanza el Project Gutenberg\r\nAudio eBooks, una colleccion de libros audio (leidos por el ser\r\nhumano), asi como el Sheet Music Subproject (Subproyecto para\r\npartituras), una colleccion de partituras digitalizadas y de\r\ngrabaciones musicales. Un otro subproyecto tambien ofrece una\r\ncolleccion de imagenes.\r\n\r\n# De 10.000 a 20.000 ebooks\r\n\r\nEn diciembre de 2003, las colecciones rondan los 11.000 libros\r\ndigitales. Varios formatos estan representados (HTML, XML, RTF, etc.)\r\npero el formato principal - y obligatorio - sigue siendo el ASCII. Hay\r\n46.000 archivos en conjunto, lo que equivale a una capacidad total de\r\n110 G (gigabytes). El 13 de febrero de 2004, fecha en la que Michael\r\nHart da una conferencia en la sede de la UNESCO en Paris, las\r\ncolecciones abarcan exactamente 11.340 ebooks en 25 idiomas. En mayo de\r\n2004, los 12.500 ebooks disponibles representan 100.000 archivos en\r\nveinte formatos diferentes, lo que equivale a una capacidad total de\r\n135 G (gigabytes), y esta deberia duplicarse cada ano con la agregacion\r\nde mas de 300 ebooks al mes (338 ebooks al mes en 2004).\r\n\r\nEl Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC), lanzado en 1997 para\r\nreunir otras colecciones de libros digitales en un punto de acceso\r\nunico, es afiliado oficialmente al Proyecto Gutenberg en 2003.\r\n\r\nSe inicia tambien un proyecto europeo a iniciativa del Proyecto Rastko,\r\nbasado en Belgrado (Serbia). El Proyecto Gutenberg Europa y Distributed\r\nProofreaders Europa nacen en enero de 2004, con cien libros disponibles\r\npara abril de 2005, en varios idiomas con el fin de reflejar la\r\ndiversidad lingueistica que prevalece en Europa.\r\n\r\nEn enero de 2005, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea el eBook #15000,\r\nThe Life of Reason (La vida de la razon, 1906) de George Santayana.\r\n\r\nSi bien en febrero de 2004 solo habia libros en 25 idiomas, en julio de\r\n2005 estan representados 42 idiomas, entre los cuales el sanscrito y\r\nlas lenguas maya.\r\n\r\nEl Project Gutenberg Australia (lanzado en agosto de 2001) celebra sus\r\n500 libros en julio de 2005.\r\n\r\nEn enero de 2006 se crea el Project Gutenberg PrePrints para acoger\r\nnuevos documentos que por su interes merecerian estar en linea, pero\r\nque no pueden ser incorporados a las colecciones existentes sin su\r\nprocesamiento previo por voluntarios: colecciones incompletas, calidad\r\ninsuficiente, necesidad de conversion a otro formato, etc. Los\r\nPrePrints cuentan con 379 ebooks en diciembre de 2006, y 2.020 ebooks\r\nen febrero de 2009.\r\n\r\nEn diciembre de 2006, el Proyecto Gutenberg alcanza los 20.000 libros\r\ndigitales. El eBook #20000 es un libro audio, Twenty Thousand Leagues\r\nUnder the Sea (Veinte mil leguas de viaje submarino, 1869), la version\r\ninglesa de la novela de Julio Verne en frances. En 2006, la produccion\r\nes de unos 345 nuevos ebooks al mes.\r\n\r\nAunque se hayan necesitado 32 anos y tres meses, de julio de 1971 a\r\noctubre de 2003, para producir los 10.000 primeros ebooks, bastara con\r\nsolo tres anos y dos meses, de octubre de 2003 a diciembre de 2006,\r\npara producir los 10.000 ebooks siguientes.\r\n\r\nPor la misma fecha, el Project Gutenberg Australia ronda los 1.500\r\nebooks (se alcanza esta cifra en abril de 2007) y el Proyecto Gutenberg\r\nEuropa cuenta con 400 ebooks.\r\n\r\nEn diciembre de 2006 figuran 50 idiomas. Diez idiomas cuentan con\r\ncolecciones de mas de 50 libros: el ingles (17.377 libros el 16 de\r\ndiciembre de 2006), el frances (966 libros), el aleman (412 libros), el\r\nfinlandes (344 libros), el holandes (244 libros), el espanol (140\r\nlibros), el italiano (102 libros), el chino (69 libros), el portugues\r\n(68 libros) y el tagalog (51 libros).\r\n\r\n# De 20.000 a 30.000 ebooks\r\n\r\nSe estrena el blog Project Gutenberg News en noviembre de 2006 a\r\ninstigacion de Mike Cook, para complementar las cartas de informacion\r\n(semanal y mensual) que ya llevaban muchos anos de existencia.\r\n\r\nEl blog presenta por ejemplo las estadisticas de produccion semanales,\r\nmensuales y anuales desde 2001.\r\n\r\nLa produccion semanal se eleva a 24 libros en 2001, 47 libros en 2002,\r\n79 libros en 2003, 78 libros en 2004, 58 libros en 2005 y 80 libros en\r\n2006.\r\n\r\nLa produccion mensual es de 104 libros en 2001, 203 libros en 2002, 348\r\nlibros en 2003, 338 libros en 2004, 252 libros en 2005 y 345 libros en\r\n2006.\r\n\r\nLa produccion anual es de 1.244 libros en 2001, 2.432 libros en 2002,\r\n4.176 libros en 2003, 4.058 libros en 2004, 3.019 libros en 2005 y\r\n4.141 libros en 2006.\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg Canada (PGC) ve la luz el 1 deg. de julio de 2007,\r\ndia de la fiesta nacional, a instigacion de Michael Shepard y David\r\nJones. Poco despues nace Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) cuya\r\nproduccion empieza en diciembre de 2007. Los cien primeros ebooks estan\r\ndisponibles en marzo de 2008, en ingles, en frances y en italiano.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders (DP), lanzado en octubre de 2000, cuenta con\r\nmiles de voluntarios en enero de 2008, con un total de 11.934 libros\r\nprocesados en siete anos y tres meses. Distributed Proofreaders Europa\r\n(DP Europe), lanzado en enero de 2004, cuenta con 1.500 voluntarios.\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC), lanzado en diciembre de 2007,\r\ncuenta con 250 voluntarios.\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg alcanza los 25.000 libros digitales en abril de\r\n2008. El eBook #25000 es English Book Collectors (Colleccionistas\r\ningleses de libros, 1902) de William Younger Fletcher.\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg Europa alcanza los 500 libros en octubre de 2008.\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg contabiliza 30.000 libros en octubre de 2009. El\r\neBook #30000 es The Bird Book (El libro de los aves, 1915), de Chester\r\nAlbert Reed.\r\n\r\n# 30.000 ebooks y mas\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders celebra su decimo aniversario en octubre de\r\n2010, con mas de 18.000 libros digitalizados y corregidos en diez anos\r\npor miles de voluntarios.\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg cuenta con mas de 33.000 ebooks en diciembre de\r\n2010, en varios formatos para lectura en un ordenador, un PDA, un\r\ntelefono movil, un smartphone o una tableta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLE PROJET GUTENBERG A 40 ANS [FR]\r\n\r\n\r\nAu 16e siecle, Gutenberg avait permis a chacun d'avoir des livres\r\nimprimes pour un prix relativement modique. Au 21e siecle, le Projet\r\nGutenberg permettrait a chacun d'avoir une bibliotheque numerique\r\ngratuite.\r\n\r\n# Gestation\r\n\r\nQuels furent les tous debuts du projet? Alors etudiant a l'Universite\r\nde l'Illinois (Etats-Unis), Michael Hart se voit attribuer quelques\r\nmillions de dollars de \"temps machine\" dans le laboratoire informatique\r\nde son universite.\r\n\r\nLe 4 juillet 1971, jour de la fete nationale, il saisit The United\r\nStates Declaration of Independence (Declaration de l'independance des\r\nEtats-Unis) sur le clavier de son ordinateur, en caracteres majuscules,\r\npuisque les caracteres minuscules n'existent pas encore. Le texte\r\nelectronique represente 5 Ko (kilo-octets). L'envoi d'un fichier de 5\r\nKo a la centaine de personnes utilisant le pre-internet de l'epoque\r\naurait fait imploser celui-ci, la bande passante etant infime. Michael\r\ndiffuse donc un message indiquant ou le texte est stocke - sans lien\r\nhypertexte toutefois, puisque le web ne voit le jour que vingt ans\r\napres - suite a quoi le fichier est telecharge par six personnes. Le\r\nProjet Gutenberg est ne.\r\n\r\nDans la foulee, Michael decide de consacrer l'enorme credit-temps mis a\r\nsa disposition a la recherche des oeuvres litteraires disponibles dans\r\nles bibliotheques et a la numerisation de celles-ci. Au lieu d'etre un\r\nensemble de pages reliees, le livre sera un texte electronique pouvant\r\netre deroule en continu.\r\n\r\nPeu apres, Michael definit la mission du Projet Gutenberg: mettre a la\r\ndisposition de tous gratuitement, par voie electronique, le plus grand\r\nnombre possible d'oeuvres litteraires.\r\n\r\nApres avoir saisi The United States Declaration of Independence\r\n(Declaration de l'independance des Etats-Unis, signee le 4 juillet\r\n1776) en 1971, Michael poursuit ses efforts en 1972 en saisissant The\r\nUnited States Bill of Rights (Declaration des droits des Etats-Unis).\r\nCe texte comprend les dix premiers amendements ajoutes en 1789 a la\r\nConstitution des Etats-Unis (qui date elle-meme de 1787), et\r\ndefinissant les droits individuels des citoyens et les pouvoirs\r\nrespectifs du gouvernement federal et des Etats. En 1973, un volontaire\r\nsaisit The United States Constitution (Constitution des Etats-Unis)\r\ndans son entier.\r\n\r\nL'internet, qui etait encore embryonnaire en 1971, debute veritablement\r\nen 1974, suite a la creation du protocole TCP/IP (Transmission Control\r\nProtocol / Internet Protocol).\r\n\r\nD'annee en annee, la capacite de la disquette augmente regulierement -\r\nle disque dur n'existe pas encore -, si bien qu'il est possible\r\nd'envisager des fichiers de plus en plus volumineux. Des volontaires\r\nentreprennent la numerisation de La Bible, composee elle-meme de\r\nplusieurs livres pouvant etre traites separement et occuper chacun un\r\nfichier different.\r\n\r\nMichael Hart debute la saisie des oeuvres completes de Shakespeare,\r\navec l'aide de volontaires, une piece de theatre apres l'autre, avec un\r\nfichier pour chaque piece. Cette version n'est d'ailleurs jamais mise\r\nen ligne, du fait d'une loi plus contraignante sur le copyright entree\r\nen vigueur dans l'intervalle, et qui vise non pas le texte de\r\nShakespeare, tombe depuis longtemps dans le domaine public, mais les\r\ncommentaires et notes de l'edition correspondante. D'autres editions\r\nannotees appartenant au domaine public sont mises en ligne quelques\r\nannees plus tard.\r\n\r\n# De 10 a 1.000 ebooks\r\n\r\nEn aout 1989, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne l'eBook #10, The King\r\nJames Bible, une bible publiee pour la premiere fois en 1611 et dont la\r\nversion la plus connue date de 1769. L'ensemble des fichiers de\r\nl'Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament represente 5 Mo (mega-\r\noctets).\r\n\r\nEn 1990, les internautes sont au nombre de 250.000, et le standard en\r\nvigueur est la disquette de 360 Ko. En janvier 1991, Michael Hart\r\nsaisit Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Alice au pays des merveilles,\r\n1865) de Lewis Carroll. En juillet de la meme annee, il saisit Peter\r\nPan (1904) de James M. Barrie. Ces deux classiques de la litterature\r\nenfantine tiennent chacun sur une disquette standard.\r\n\r\nArrive ensuite le web, operationnel en 1991. Le premier navigateur,\r\nMosaic, apparait en novembre 1993. Lorsque l'utilisation du web se\r\ngeneralise, il devient plus facile de faire circuler les textes\r\nelectroniques et de recruter des volontaires.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg rode sa methode de travail, avec la numerisation\r\nd'un texte par mois en 1991, deux textes par mois en 1992, quatre\r\ntextes par mois en 1993 et huit textes par mois en 1994.\r\n\r\nEn janvier 1994, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne l'eBook #100, The\r\nComplete Works of William Shakespeare (Les oeuvres completes de William\r\nShakespeare). Shakespeare ecrivit l'essentiel de son oeuvre entre 1590\r\net 1613.\r\n\r\nLa production continue ensuite d'augmenter, avec une moyenne de 16\r\nnouveaux titres par mois en 1995 et 32 nouveaux titres par mois en\r\n1996.\r\n\r\nComme on le voit, entre 1991 et 1996, la production double chaque\r\nannee. Tout en continuant de numeriser des livres, Michael coordonne\r\ndesormais le travail de dizaines de volontaires.\r\n\r\nEn 1997, la production est toujours de 32 nouveaux titres par mois. En\r\njuin 1997, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne The Merry Adventures of\r\nRobin Hood (Les aventures de Robin des Bois, 1883) de Howard Pyle. En\r\naout 1997, il met en ligne l'eBook #1000, La Divina Commedia (La Divine\r\nComedie, 1321) de Dante Alighieri, dans sa langue d'origine, en\r\nitalien.\r\n\r\nA l'epoque, le Projet Gutenberg s'articule en trois grands secteurs:\r\n(a) \"Light Literature\" (litterature de divertissement), qui inclut par\r\nexemple Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Peter Pan ou Aesop's Fables\r\n(Fables d'Esope); (b) \"Heavy Literature\" (litterature \"serieuse\"), qui\r\ninclut par exemple La Bible, les oeuvres de Shakespeare ou Moby Dick;\r\n(c) \"Reference Literature\" (litterature de reference), composee\r\nd'encyclopedies et de dictionnaires, par exemple le Roget's Thesaurus.\r\nUn classement par rubriques plus detaille remplacera par la suite ces\r\ntrois secteurs.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg se veut universel, aussi bien pour les oeuvres\r\nchoisies que pour le public vise, le but etant de mettre la litterature\r\na la disposition de tous, en depassant largement le public habituel des\r\netudiants et des enseignants. Le secteur consacre a la litterature de\r\ndivertissement est destine a amener devant l'ecran un public tres\r\ndivers, par exemple des enfants et leurs grands-parents recherchant le\r\ntexte electronique de Peter Pan apres avoir vu le film Hook, ou\r\nrecherchant la version electronique d'Alice au pays des merveilles\r\napres avoir regarde l'adaptation filmee a la television, ou recherchant\r\nl'origine d'une citation litteraire apres avoir vu un episode de Star\r\nTrek. Pratiquement tous les episodes de Star Trek citent des livres\r\nayant leur correspondant numerique dans le Projet Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nL'objectif est donc que le public, qu'il soit familier ou non avec le\r\nlivre imprime, puisse facilement retrouver des textes entendus dans des\r\nconversations, des films, des musiques, ou alors lus dans d'autres\r\nlivres, journaux et magazines.\r\n\r\nLes textes electroniques (appeles \"etexts\" ou \"ebooks\") sont stockes de\r\nla maniere la plus simple possible, au format ASCII (American Standard\r\nCode for Information Interchange), pour que ces textes puissent etre\r\nlus sans probleme quels que soient la plateforme et le logiciel\r\nutilises. Des lettres capitales remplacent les termes en italique, en\r\ngras et soulignes de la version imprimee. Les fichiers electroniques\r\nprennent peu de place et peuvent etre facilement telecharges. La\r\nrecherche textuelle est tout aussi simple. Il suffit d'utiliser la\r\nfonction \"rechercher\" presente dans n'importe quel logiciel.\r\n\r\nMichael Hart ecrit en aout 1998 lors d'un entretien par courriel: \"Nous\r\nconsiderons le texte electronique comme un nouveau medium, sans\r\nveritable relation avec le papier. Le seul point commun est que nous\r\ndiffusons les memes oeuvres, mais je ne vois pas comment le papier peut\r\nconcurrencer le texte electronique une fois que les gens y sont\r\nhabitues, particulierement dans les etablissements d'enseignement....\r\nMon projet est de mettre 10.000 textes electroniques sur l'internet.\r\n[NDLR: Ce sera chose faite en octobre 2003.] Si je pouvais avoir des\r\nsubventions importantes, j'aimerais aller jusqu'a un million et etendre\r\naussi le nombre de nos usagers potentiels de 1,x% a 10% de la\r\npopulation mondiale, ce qui representerait la diffusion de 1.000 fois\r\nun milliard de textes electroniques, au lieu d'un milliard seulement.\"\r\n\r\n# De 1.000 a 10.000 ebooks\r\n\r\nEntre 1998 et 2000, la moyenne est constante, avec 36 nouveaux titres\r\npar mois. En mai 1999, les collections comptent 2.000 livres\r\nnumeriques. L'eBook #2000 est Don Quijote (Don Quichotte, 1605) de\r\nCervantes, dans sa langue d'origine, en espagnol.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders (DP) est lance en octobre 2000 par Charles\r\nFranks pour permettre la correction partagee des livres entre de\r\nnombreux volontaires. Les volontaires choisissent un livre en cours de\r\ntraitement pour relire et corriger une page donnee. Chacun travaille a\r\nson propre rythme. A titre indicatif, il est conseille de relire une\r\npage par jour. C'est peu de temps sur une journee, et c'est beaucoup\r\npour le projet.\r\n\r\nDisponible en decembre 2000, l'eBook #3000 est le troisieme volume de A\r\nl'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (1919) de Marcel Proust, dans sa\r\nlangue d'origine, en francais. La moyenne passe a 104 livres par mois\r\nen 2001.\r\n\r\nLe Project Gutenberg Australia voir le jour en aout 2001.\r\n\r\nMis en ligne en octobre 2001, l'eBook #4000 est The French Immortals\r\nSeries (Collection de textes d'Immortels francais), dans sa traduction\r\nanglaise. Publie a Paris en 1905 par la Maison Mazarin, ce livre\r\nrassemble plusieurs fictions d'ecrivains couronnes par l'Academie\r\nfrancaise, comme Emile Souvestre, Pierre Loti, Hector Malot, Charles de\r\nBernard, Alphonse Daudet, etc.\r\n\r\nDisponible en avril 2002, l'eBook #5000 est The Notebooks of Leonardo\r\nda Vinci (Les Carnets de Leonard de Vinci), des carnets datant du debut\r\ndu 16e siecle et traduits de l'italien vers l'anglais. Ces carnets ont\r\nconstamment ete dans le Top 100 des livres telecharges depuis leur mise\r\nen ligne.\r\n\r\nEn 1991, Michael Hart avait choisi de numeriser Alice's Adventures in\r\nWonderland et Peter Pan parce que, dans l'un et l'autre cas, leur\r\nversion numerisee tenait sur une disquette de 360 Ko, le standard de\r\nl'epoque. Quinze ans plus tard, en 2002, on dispose de disquettes de\r\n1,44 Mo et on peut aisement compresser les fichiers en les zippant. Un\r\nfichier standard peut desormais comporter trois millions de caracteres,\r\nplus qu'il n'en faut pour un livre de taille moyenne, puisqu'un roman\r\nde 300 pages numerise au format ASCII represente un mega-octet. Un\r\nlivre volumineux tient sur deux fichiers ASCII, telechargeables tels\r\nquels ou en version zippee.\r\n\r\nCinquante heures environ sont necessaires pour selectionner un livre de\r\ntaille moyenne, verifier qu'il est bien du domaine public, le scanner,\r\nle corriger, le formater et le mettre en page.\r\n\r\nQuelques numeros de livres sont reserves pour l'avenir, par exemple le\r\nnumero 1984 (eBook #1984) pour le roman eponyme de George Orwell,\r\npublie en 1949, et qui est donc loin d'etre tombe dans le domaine\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nAu printemps 2002, les collections representent le quart des oeuvres du\r\ndomaine public en acces libre sur le web, recensees de maniere\r\npratiquement exhaustive par l'Internet Public Library (IPL), un beau\r\nresultat du au patient travail de milliers de volontaires actifs dans\r\nde nombreux pays. En 2002, la production est   de 203 nouveaux titres\r\npar mois.\r\n\r\nEn novembre 2002, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne les 75 fichiers du\r\nHuman Genome Project (Projet du genome humain, a savoir le sequencage\r\ndu genome humain), ceci peu de temps apres sa parution initiale en\r\nfevrier 2001, puisqu'il appartient d'emblee au domaine public. Chaque\r\nfichier se chiffre en dizaines sinon en centaines de mega-octets.\r\n\r\n1.000 livres en aout 1997, 2.000 livres en mai 1999, 3.000 livres en\r\ndecembre 2000, 4.000 livres en octobre 2001, 5.000 livres en avril\r\n2002, 10.000 livres en octobre 2003. L'eBook #10000 est The Magna\r\nCarta, qui fut le premier texte constitutionnel anglais, signe en 1215.\r\n\r\nEntre avril 2002 et octobre 2003, les collections doublent, passant de\r\n5.000 a 10.000 livres en dix-huit mois. La moyenne mensuelle est de 348\r\nnouveaux titres en 2003. Cette croissance rapide est due a l'activite\r\nde Distributed Proofreaders (DP), un site concu en octobre 2000 pour\r\npermettre la correction partagee des livres entre de nombreux\r\nvolontaires.\r\n\r\nEn aout 2003, un CD Best of Gutenberg est disponible avec une selection\r\nde 600 ebooks. En decembre 2003, date a laquelle le Projet Gutenberg\r\nfete ses 10.000 ebooks, la quasi-totalite de ceux-ci (9.400 ebooks) est\r\ngravee sur un DVD. CD et DVD sont envoyes gratuitement a qui en fait la\r\ndemande. Libre ensuite a chacun de faire autant de copies que possible\r\net de les distribuer autour de soi dans des ecoles et des\r\nbibliotheques.\r\n\r\nEn septembre 2003, le Projet Gutenberg lance le Projet Gutenberg Audio\r\neBooks, une collection de livres audio (lus par l'etre humain), ainsi\r\nque le Sheet Music Subproject (Sous-projet pour les partitions\r\nmusicales), une collection rassemblant des partitions musicales et des\r\nenregistrements musicaux. Un autre sous-projet rassemble des images\r\nfixes et animees.\r\n\r\n# De 10.000 a 20.000 ebooks\r\n\r\nEn decembre 2003, les collections approchent les 11.000 ebooks.\r\nPlusieurs formats sont desormais presents, par exemple les formats\r\nHTML, XML et RTF, le format principal - et obligatoire - restant\r\nl'ASCII. Le tout represente 46.000 fichiers, soit une capacite totale\r\nde 110 Go (giga-octets). Le 13 fevrier 2004, date de la conference de\r\nMichael Hart au siege de l'UNESCO a Paris, les collections comprennent\r\ntres exactement 11.340 ebooks dans 25 langues. En mai 2004, les 12.500\r\nebooks disponibles representent 100.000 fichiers dans une vingtaine de\r\nformats, soit une capacite totale de 135 Go, destinee a doubler chaque\r\nannee avec l'ajout d'environ 300 ebooks par mois (338 ebooks en 2004).\r\n\r\nParallelement, le Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC), qui avait\r\nete lance en 1997 pour rassembler des collections de livres numeriques\r\ndeja existantes et provenant de sources diverses, est officiellement\r\naffilie au Projet Gutenberg en 2003.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg Europe est lance en janvier 2004 a l'instigation du\r\nProjet Rastko, base a Belgrade, en Serbie. Distributed Proofreaders\r\nEurope debute la production de livres numeriques a la meme date, avec\r\ncent livres disponibles en avril 2005. Les livres sont en plusieurs\r\nlangues pour refleter la diversite linguistique prevalant en Europe.\r\n\r\nEn janvier 2005, le Projet Gutenberg met en ligne l'eBook #15000, The\r\nLife of Reason (La vie de raison, 1906) de George Santayana.\r\n\r\nEn juin 2005, le nombre de livres s'eleve a 16.000. Si 25 langues\r\nseulement etaient presentes en fevrier 2004, 42 langues sont\r\nrepresentees en juin 2005, dont le sanscrit et les langues mayas.\r\n\r\nLe Project Gutenberg Australia (lance en aout 2001) fete ses 500 livres\r\nen juillet 2005.\r\n\r\nUn nouveau secteur, denomme Project Gutenberg PrePrints, est lance en\r\njanvier 2006 pour accueillir de nouveaux documents suffisamment\r\ninteressants pour etre mis en ligne, mais ne pouvant etre integres aux\r\ncollections du Projet Gutenberg sans traitement ulterieur par des\r\nvolontaires, pour diverses raisons: collections incompletes, qualite\r\ninsuffisante, conversion souhaitee dans un autre format, etc. Les\r\nPrePrints comprennent 379 ebooks en decembre 2006, et 2.020 ebooks en\r\nfevrier 2009.\r\n\r\nEn decembre 2006, le Projet Gutenberg franchit la barre des 20.000\r\nlivres. L'eBook #20000 est un livre audio, Twenty Thousand Leagues\r\nUnder the Sea, version anglaise du roman Vingt mille lieues sous les\r\nmers (1869) de Jules Verne. La moyenne est de 345 nouveaux titres par\r\nmois en 2006.\r\n\r\nS'il a fallu 32 ans et deux mois, de juillet 1971 a octobre 2003, pour\r\nnumeriser les 10.000 premiers livres, il n'aura fallu que trois ans et\r\ndeux mois, d'octobre 2003 a decembre 2006, pour numeriser les 10.000\r\nlivres suivants.\r\n\r\nA la meme date, le Project Gutenberg Australia approche les 1.500\r\nlivres (c'est chose faite en avril 2007) et le Projet Gutenberg Europe\r\ncompte 400 livres.\r\n\r\nEn decembre 2006, on compte 50 langues. Les dix langues comprenant plus\r\nde cinquante livres sont l'anglais (17.377 livres le 16 decembre 2006),\r\nle francais (966 livres), l'allemand (412 livres), le finnois (344\r\nlivres), le hollandais (244 livres), l'espagnol (140 livres), l'italien\r\n(102 livres), le chinois (69 livres), le portugais (68 livres) et le\r\ntagalog (51 livres).\r\n\r\n# De 20.000 a 30.000 ebooks\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg News, le blog officiel du Projet Gutenberg, debute en\r\nnovembre 2006 a l'instigation de Mike Cook. Ce blog complete les\r\nlettres d'information (hebdomadaire et mensuelle) existant depuis\r\nnombre d'annees. Le blog offre par exemple les statistiques de\r\nproduction hebdomadaires, mensuelles et annuelles depuis 2001.\r\n\r\nLa production hebdomadaire est de 24 livres en 2001, 47 livres en 2002,\r\n79 livres en 2003, 78 livres en 2004, 58 livres en 2005 et 80 livres en\r\n2006.\r\n\r\nLa production mensuelle est de 104 livres en 2001, 203 livres en 2002,\r\n348 livres en 2003, 338 livres en 2004, 252 livres en 2005 et 345\r\nlivres en 2006.\r\n\r\nLa production annuelle est de 1.244 livres en 2001, 2.432 livres en\r\n2002, 4.176 livres en 2003, 4.058 livres en 2004, 3.019 livres en 2005\r\net 4.141 livres en 2006.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg Canada (PGC) voit le jour le 1er juillet 2007, le\r\njour de la fete nationale, a l'instigation de Michael Shepard et David\r\nJones. Il est suivi de Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC), avec une\r\nproduction qui debute en decembre 2007. Les cent premiers livres sont\r\ndisponibles en mars 2008, en anglais, en francais et en italien.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg envoie 15 millions de livres sur CD ou DVD par\r\ncourrier postal en 2007. Le DVD le plus recent (qui date de juillet\r\n2006) comprend 17.000 livres. Le contenu des CD et DVD est egalement\r\ndisponible sous forme de fichiers ISO (depuis 2005) peuvant etre\r\ntelecharges pour graver des CD et DVD.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg compte 25.000 livres en avril 2008. L'eBook #25000\r\nest English Book Collectors (Collectionneurs de livres anglais, 1902)\r\nde William Younger Fletcher.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg Europe atteint les 500 livres en octobre 2008.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg comptabilise 30.000 livres en octobre 2009. L'eBook\r\n#30000 est The Bird Book (Le livre des oiseaux, 1915), de Chester\r\nAlbert Reed.\r\n\r\n# 30.000 ebooks et plus\r\n\r\nPrincipale source des livres du Projet Gutenberg, Distributed\r\nProofreaders (DP) fete son dixieme anniversaire en octobre 2010, avec\r\nplus de 18.000 livres patiemment numerises, relus et corriges pendant\r\ndix ans par plusieurs milliers de volontaires.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg propose plus de 33.000 ebooks de grande qualite en\r\ndecembre 2010, dans divers formats pour lecture sur ordinateur, PDA,\r\ntelephone mobile, smartphone et tablette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE PAST TO THE FUTURE [EN]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of Project Gutenberg are not only measured in numbers. The\r\nresults can also be measured in the major influence the project has\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n# Other digital libraries\r\n\r\nAs the oldest producer of free ebooks on the internet, Project\r\nGutenberg has inspired many other digital libraries, for example\r\nProjekt Runeberg for classic Nordic (Scandinavian) literature, and\r\nProjekt Gutenberg-DE for classic German literature, which started\r\nrespectively in 1992 and 1994.\r\n\r\nProjekt Runeberg was the first Swedish digital library of books from\r\npublic domain, and a partner of Project Gutenberg. It was initiated in\r\nDecember 1992 by the students' computer club Lysator, in cooperation\r\nwith the Linkoeping University (Sweden), as a volunteer project to\r\ncreate and collect free electronic editions of classic Nordic\r\nliterature and art. Around 200 ebooks were available in full text in\r\n1998. There was also a list of 6,000 Nordic authors as a tool for\r\nfurther collection development.\r\n\r\nProjekt Gutenberg-DE was the first German digital library of books from\r\npublic domain, created in 1994 as a partner of Project Gutenberg. Texts\r\nwere available for online reading, with one webpage for short texts and\r\nwith several webpages - one per chapter - for longer works. There was\r\nan alphabetic list of authors and titles, and a short biography and\r\nbibliography for each author.\r\n\r\n# \"Less is more.\"\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg has kept its administrative and financial structure\r\nto the bare minimum. Its motto fits into three words: \"Less is more.\"\r\nThe goal is to ensure its independence from loans and other funding,\r\nand from ephemeral cultural priorities, to avoid pressure from\r\npoliticians and others. The goal is also to ensure respect for the\r\nvolunteers, who can be confident their work will be used for decades.\r\nVolunteers can network through mailing lists, weekly or monthly\r\nnewsletters, discussion lists, forums, and wikis. Founded in 2000, the\r\nPGLAF (Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation) has only three\r\npart-time employees.\r\n\r\nDonations are used to buy equipment and supplies, mostly computers,\r\nscanners, and blank CDs and DVDs. CDs and DVDs are sent for free to\r\nthose who request them. After the CD Best of Gutenberg available in\r\nAugust 2003 with a selection of 600 ebooks, and a first DVD available\r\nin December 2003 with 9,400 ebooks, a second DVD is available in July\r\n2006 with 17,000 ebooks. Since 2005, CDs and DVDs have been both\r\navailable on the website of BitTorrent as ISO images that can be\r\ndownloaded to burn CDs and DVDs for personal use. In 2007, the Project\r\nGutenberg sent 15 million books by snail mail on CDs and DVDs.\r\n\r\nMore generally, Michael Hart should be given more credit as the\r\ninventor of the electronic book (ebook). If we consider the ebook in\r\nits etymological sense - i.e. a book that has been digitized to be\r\ndistributed as an electronic file - it was born with Project Gutenberg\r\nin July 1971, 30 years before the various commercial launchings that\r\npeppered the early 2000s, with the ebooks of Amazon, Barnes & Noble,\r\nGemstar, and others.\r\n\r\n# Tens of thousands of downloads per day\r\n\r\nThere is a big demand, as confirmed by the tens of thousands of books\r\nthat are downloaded every day.\r\n\r\nFor example, on July 31, 2005, there were 37,532 downloads for the day,\r\n243,808 downloads for the week, and 1,154,765 downloads for the month.\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 2007, there were 89,841 downloads for the day, 697,818\r\ndownloads for the week, and 2,995,436 downloads for the month.\r\n\r\nOn November 15, 2010, there were 130,524 downloads for the day, 888,520\r\ndownloads for the week, and 3,582,153 downloads for the month.\r\n\r\nThese numbers are the downloads from ibiblio.org (at the University of\r\nNorth Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States), the main distribution\r\nsite, which also hosts the website gutenberg.org. The Internet Archive\r\nis the backup distribution site and provides unlimited disk space for\r\nstorage and processing. Project Gutenberg has 40 mirror sites\r\nworldwide, and seeks new ones. It also encourages the use of P2P for\r\nsharing its ebooks.\r\n\r\nReaders can choose ebooks from the \"Top 100?, i.e. the top 100 ebooks\r\nand the top 100 authors for the previous day, the last seven days and\r\nthe last thirty days.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg ebooks can also help bridge the \"digital divide\".\r\nThey can be read on an outdated computer or a second-hand netbook\r\ncosting just a few dollars.\r\n\r\n# Towards the future\r\n\r\nIt is hoped machine translation software will be able to convert the\r\nebooks from one to another of 100 languages. In ten years from now,\r\nmachine translation may be judged 99% satisfactory - research is active\r\non that front, and software is improving fast - allowing for the\r\nreading of literary classics in a choice of many languages. Project\r\nGutenberg is also interested in combining translation software and\r\nhuman translators, somewhat as OCR software is now combined with the\r\nwork of proofreaders.\r\n\r\n40 years after the beginning of Project Gutenberg, Michael Hart\r\ndescribes himself as a workaholic who has devoted his entire life to\r\nhis project. He considers himself a pragmatic and farsighted altruist.\r\nFor years he was regarded as a nut but now he is respected. He wants to\r\nchange the world through freely-available ebooks that can be used and\r\ncopied endlessly, and reading and culture for everyone at minimal cost.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg's mission can be stated in eight words: \"To encourage\r\nthe creation and distribution of ebooks,\" by everybody, and by every\r\npossible means, while implementing new ideas, new methods, and new\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESDE EL PASADO HACIA EL FUTURO [ES]\r\n\r\n\r\nLos resultados del Proyecto Gutenberg no se miden solo en cifras. Los\r\nresultados se miden tambien por la influencia que ha tenido el\r\nproyecto, pues esta ha sido enorme.\r\n\r\n# Otras bibliotecas digitales\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg - primera pagina web de informacion en el\r\ninternet y primera biblioteca digital -, inspira muchas otras\r\nbibliotecas digitales, por ejemplo el Projekt Runeberg para la\r\nliteratura escandinava o el Projekt Gutenberg-DE para la literatura\r\nalemana.\r\n\r\nEl Projekt Runeberg es la primera biblioteca digital sueca de libros\r\ndel dominio publico, y un socio del Proyecto Gutenberg. Esta biblioteca\r\nes creada en diciembre de 1992 por Lysator, un club informatico de\r\nestudiantes, en colaboracion con la biblioteca de la Universidad de\r\nLinkoeping (Suecia), para producir y organizar versiones electronicas\r\ngratuitas de obras de literatura nordica (escandinava) clasica. 200\r\nobras estan disponibles en 1998, con una lista de 6.000 autores\r\nnordicos para el desarrollo de las colecciones futuras.\r\n\r\nEl Projekt Gutenberg-DE es la primera biblioteca digital alemana de\r\nlibros del dominio publico, y tambien un socio del Proyecto Gutenberg.\r\nSe pueden leer decenas de textos en linea en 1998, con una pagina web\r\npara textos cortos y varias paginas web - uno por capitulo - para obras\r\nmas largas. Una lista alfabetica de autores y de titulos esta\r\ndisponible en el sitio, con una breve biografia y bibliografia para\r\ncada autor.\r\n\r\n# Una estructura tan simple como posible\r\n\r\nLa estructura administrativa y financiera del Proyecto Gutenberg se\r\nlimita al minimo estricto. Michael Hart insiste frecuentemente sobre la\r\nnecesidad de preservar un marco lo mas flexible posible que deje campo\r\nlibre a los voluntarios, y la puerta abierta para las nuevas ideas. El\r\nobjetivo es garantizar la perennidad del proyecto, sin depender ni de\r\ncreditos y cortes de creditos, ni de las prioridades culturales,\r\nfinancieras y politicas del momento. De este modo no puede ejercerse\r\nninguna forma de presion por el poder o el dinero. Ademas esto\r\nsignifica respeto para con los voluntarios, quienes pueden estar\r\nseguros de que veran su trabajo utilizado durante muchos anos. En\r\ncuanto a la supervision regular del proyecto, se garantiza gracias a\r\ncartas de informacion semanales y mensuales, foros de discusion, wikis\r\ny blogs.\r\n\r\nLas donaciones sirven para financiar ordenadores y escaneres, y para\r\nenviar CD y DVD gratuitos a aquellos que los solicitan. Despues del CD\r\n\"Best of Gutenberg\" disponible en agosto de 2003 con una seleccion de\r\n600 libros y de un primer DVD disponible en diciembre de 2003 con 9.400\r\nlibros, un segundo DVD esta disponible en julio de 2006 con 17.000\r\nlibros. A partir de 2005, CD y DVD ambos estan disponibles en el sitio\r\nweb de BitTorrent, bajo la forma de imagenes ISO que se pueden\r\ndescargar con el fin de grabar CD y DVD a titulo personal. En 2007, el\r\nProyecto Gutenberg envia 15 millones de libros por correo postal bajo\r\nla forma de CD y DVD.\r\n\r\nAunque demasiadas veces se silencie, cabe recordar que el verdadero\r\ninventor del ebook es Michael Hart. Si tomamos la palabra \"ebook\" en su\r\nsentido etimologico - a saber un libro digital para difusion bajo la\r\nforma de un archivo electronico - habria nacido con el Proyecto\r\nGutenberg en julio de 1971, 30 anos antes de los diversos lanzamientos\r\ncomerciales que salpicaron el principio de los anos 2000 con los ebooks\r\nde Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Gemstar y demas.\r\n\r\n# Decenas de miles de descargas al dia\r\n\r\nLa demanda es enorme, a prueba de ello el numero de descargas, que se\r\ncifran en decenas de miles diarias.\r\n\r\nA fecha del 31 de julio de 2005, se cuenta con 37.532 archivos\r\ndescargados al dia, 243.808 archivos a la semana y 1.154.765 archivos\r\nal mes.\r\n\r\nA fecha del 6 de mayo de 2007, se cuenta con 89.841 archivos\r\ndescargados al dia, 697.818 archivos a la semana y 2.995.436 archivos\r\nal mes.\r\n\r\nA fecha del 15 de noviembre de 2010, se cuenta con 130.524 archivos\r\ndescargados al dia, 888.520 archivos a la semana y 3.582.153 archivos\r\nal mes.\r\n\r\nY esto solo concierne el sitio web de descargas principal, ibiblio.org\r\n(basado en la Universidad de Carolina del Norte, Estados Unidos), que\r\nalberga tambien el sitio web del Proyecto Gutenberg. El segundo sitio\r\nweb de descargas es el del Internet Archive, que tambien sirve de copia\r\nde seguridad y le proporciona al\r\nProyecto Gutenberg une capacidad de almacenamiento ilimitada.\r\n\r\nUn Top 100 inventaria los cien titulos y los cien autores que mas han\r\nsido descargados durante el dia, la semana y el mes.\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg dispone de 40 sitios web espejo repartidos en\r\ntoda la planeta, y aun necesita encontrar otros. Los archivos tambien\r\ncirculan en modo P2P (peer-to-peer), lo que permite a cualquier\r\nutilizador intercambiar directamente archivos con otro utilizador.\r\n\r\nLos libros del Proyecto Gutenberg pueden ayudar a colmar la fractura\r\ndigital. Es muy sencillo descargarlos en un ordenador o un dispositivo\r\nmovil de segunda mano que no cuestan mas de unos dolares o decenas de\r\ndolares.\r\n\r\n# Hacia el futuro\r\n\r\nMas adelante, quizas se pueda contemplar la idea de una traduccion\r\nsimultanea a unos cien idiomas, utilizando un programa de traduccion\r\nautomatica con un margen de fiabilidad del orden de 99% en el futuro.\r\nLos textos generados por el software de traduccion automatica pasarian\r\nluego en manos de traductores (no maquinas, sino seres humanos) para\r\nhacerles algunos retoques, siguiendo un modelo parecido al de la\r\ntecnologia OCR, que no puede prescindir de los correctores (no de los\r\nsoftware, sino de los seres humanos) para ofrecer un contenido de\r\ncalidad optima.\r\n\r\nCuarenta anos despues de la creacion del Proyecto Gutenberg, Michael\r\nHart se define aun como un adicto al trabajo que sigue dedicandose\r\nenteramente a su proyecto, proyecto que en su opinion esta al origen de\r\nuna revolucion neo-industrial. Se define tambien a si mismo como un\r\naltruista, pragmatico y visionario. Tras haber sido tildado de chiflado\r\ndurante anos, ahora suscita el respeto.\r\n\r\nCon el pasar de los anos, la mision del Proyecto Gutenberg nunca ha\r\ndejado de ser la misma, a saber la de cambiar el mundo mediante el\r\nebook gratuito, de uso infinito y repetible. El objetivo tambien sigue\r\nsiendo el mismo, es decir la lectura gratis y la cultura para todos.\r\n\r\nEn cuanto a la mision, se resume en pocas palabras: \"fomentar la\r\ncreacion y la distribucion de los ebooks\", por cuantas personas sea\r\nposible, por todos los medios posibles, y aceptando tambien los virajes\r\nnecesarios para integrar nuevas ideas, nuevos metodos y nuevos\r\nsoportes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDU PASSE VERS L'AVENIR [FR]\r\n\r\n\r\nLes resultats du Projet Gutenberg ne se mesurent pas seulement a des\r\nchiffres. Les resultats se mesurent aussi a l'influence du projet, qui\r\nest considerable.\r\n\r\n# D'autres bibliotheques numeriques\r\n\r\nPremier site d'information sur l'internet et premiere bibliotheque\r\nnumerique, le Projet Gutenberg inspire bien d'autres bibliotheques\r\nnumeriques au fil des ans, a commencer par le Projekt Runeberg pour la\r\nlitterature scandinave et le Projekt Gutenberg-DE pour la litterature\r\nallemande.\r\n\r\nLe Projekt Runeberg est la premiere bibliotheque numerique suedoise de\r\nlivres du domaine public, creee en decembre 1992 par Lysator, un club\r\ninformatique d'etudiants, en collaboration avec la bibliotheque de\r\nl'Universite de Linkoeping (Suede). Le but est de produire et organiser\r\ndes  versions electroniques gratuites de la litterature nordique\r\nclassique. 200 oeuvres sont disponibles en 1998, avec une liste de\r\n6.000 auteurs nordiques en tant qu'outil de developpement des\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nProjekt Gutenberg-DE est la premiere bibliotheque numerique allemande\r\nde livres du domaine public. Plusieurs dizaines de textes peuvent etre\r\nlus en ligne en 1998, avec une page web pour les textes courts et\r\nplusieurs pages - une par chapitre - pour les oeuvres plus longues. Une\r\nliste alphabetique d'auteurs et de titres est egalement disponible,\r\nainsi qu'une courte biographie et bibliographie pour chaque auteur.\r\n\r\n# Une structure aussi simple que possible\r\n\r\nLa structure administrative et financiere du Projet Gutenberg se limite\r\nau strict minimum, avec une devise qui tient en trois mots: \"Less is\r\nmore\". Michael Hart insiste regulierement sur la necessite d'un cadre\r\naussi souple que possible laissant toute initiative aux volontaires, et\r\nla porte grande ouverte aux idees nouvelles. Le but est d'assurer la\r\nperennite du projet independamment des credits, des coupures de credits\r\net des priorites culturelles, financieres et politiques du moment. Pas\r\nde pression possible donc par le pouvoir et par l'argent. Et respect a\r\nl'egard des volontaires, qui sont assures de voir leur travail utilise\r\npendant de nombreuses annees. Le suivi regulier du projet est assure\r\ngrace a une lettre d'information hebdomadaire et mensuelle, des forums\r\nde discussion, des wikis et des blogs.\r\n\r\nLes dons servent a financer des ordinateurs et des scanners, et a\r\nenvoyer des CD et DVD gratuits a tous ceux qui en font la demande.\r\nSuite au CD Best of Gutenberg disponible en aout 2003 avec une\r\nselection de 600 titres, un premier DVD est disponible en decembre 2003\r\navec 9.400 titres, suivi d'un deuxieme DVD disponible en juillet 2006\r\navec 17.000 titres. A partir de 2005, CD et DVD sont disponibles sous\r\nforme d'images ISO sur le site de BitTorrent, ces images pouvant etre\r\ntelechargees pour graver des CD et DVD sur place a titre personnel. En\r\n2007, le Projet Gutenberg envoie 15 millions de livres par voie postale\r\nsous forme de CD et DVD.\r\n\r\nChose souvent passee sous silence, Michael Hart est le veritable\r\ninventeur de l'ebook. Si on considere l'ebook dans son sens\r\netymologique, a savoir un livre numerise pour diffusion sous forme de\r\nfichier electronique, celui-ci serait ne avec le Projet Gutenberg en\r\njuillet 1971, trente ans avant les divers lancements commerciaux ayant\r\nemaille le debut des annees 2000 avec les ebooks d'Amazon, Barnes &\r\nNoble, Gemstar et autres.\r\n\r\n# Des dizaines de milliers de telechargements par jour\r\n\r\nLa demande est enorme. En temoigne le nombre de telechargements, qui se\r\ncomptent  en dizaines de milliers par jour.\r\n\r\nA la date du 31 juillet 2005, on compte 37.532 fichiers telecharges\r\ndans la journee, 243.808 fichiers telecharges dans la semaine et\r\n1.154.765 fichiers telecharges dans le mois.\r\n\r\nA la date du 6 mai 2007, on compte 89.841 fichiers telecharges dans la\r\njournee, 697.818 fichiers telecharges dans la semaine et 2.995.436\r\nfichiers telecharges dans le mois. Courant mai, ce nombre atteint les 3\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nA la date du 15 novembre 2010, on compte 130.524 fichiers telecharges\r\ndans la journee, 888.520 fichiers telecharges dans la semaine et\r\n3.582.153 fichiers telecharges dans le mois.\r\n\r\nCeci uniquement pour le principal site de telechargement, ibiblio.org\r\n(base a l'Universite de Caroline du Nord, aux Etats-Unis), qui heberge\r\naussi le site du Projet Gutenberg. Le deuxieme site de telechargement\r\nest l'Internet Archive, qui est le site de sauvegarde et qui met a la\r\ndisposition du Projet Gutenberg une capacite de stockage illimitee.\r\n\r\nUn \"Top 100\" recense les cent titres et les cent auteurs les plus\r\ntelecharges dans la journee, dans la semaine et dans le mois.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg dispose de 40 sites miroirs repartis sur toute la\r\nplanete, et il en cherche d'autres. La circulation des fichiers se fait\r\naussi en mode P2P (Peer-to-Peer), qui permet d'echanger des fichiers\r\ndirectement d'un utilisateur a l'autre.\r\n\r\nLes livres du Projet Gutenberg peuvent aider a combler la fracture\r\nnumerique. Ils sont aisement telechargeables sur un ordinateur ou un\r\nnetbook d'occasion ne coutant que quelques dollars ou quelques dizaines\r\nde dollars.\r\n\r\n# Vers l'avenir\r\n\r\nPlus tard, il sera peut-etre possible d'envisager une traduction\r\nsimultanee dans une centaine de langues, en utilisant un logiciel de\r\ntraduction automatique qui aurait alors un taux de fiabilite de l'ordre\r\nde 99%, un pourcentage dont on est encore loin. Ce logiciel de\r\ntraduction automatique serait relaye par des traducteurs (non pas des\r\nmachines, mais des etres humains), sur un modele comparable a la\r\ntechnologie OCR actuellement relayee par des correcteurs (non pas des\r\nlogiciels, mais des etres humains) pour offrir un contenu de grande\r\nqualite.\r\n\r\nQuarante ans apres les debuts du Projet Gutenberg, Michael Hart se\r\ndefinit toujours comme un fou de travail dediant toute sa vie a son\r\nprojet, qu'il voit comme etant a l'origine d'une revolution neo-\r\nindustrielle. Il se definit aussi comme altruiste, pragmatique et\r\nvisionnaire. Apres avoir ete traite de toque pendant de nombreuses\r\nannees, il force maintenant le respect.\r\n\r\nAu fil des ans, la mission du Projet Gutenberg reste la meme, a savoir\r\nchanger le monde par le biais de l'ebook gratuit indefiniment\r\nutilisable et reproductible, et favoriser ainsi la lecture et la\r\nculture pour tous a moindres frais.\r\n\r\nCette mission se resume en quelques mots: \"encourager la creation et la\r\ndistribution d'ebooks\", par autant de personnes que possible, et par\r\ntous les moyens de diffusion possibles, tout en prenant les virages\r\nnecessaires pour integrer de nouvelles idees, de nouvelles methodes et\r\nde nouveaux supports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT GUTENBERG AND LANGUAGES [EN]\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg mainly offers English-language ebooks, but\r\nmultilingualism has become one of its priorities. French is the second\r\nlanguage of the project. There were ebooks in 60 languages in December\r\n2010.\r\n\r\n# In 1990-94\r\n\r\nInitially, the ebooks were in English. As Project Gutenberg was\r\nlaunched from the University of Illinois (United States), with the help\r\nof English-speaking volunteers, its first goal has been to provide\r\nebooks to the English-language community, that is to say 95% of\r\ninternet users in the early 1990s. (Non-English-speaking users reached\r\n50% in summer 2000, with a percentage steadily growing ever since.)\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg was also inspiring other digital libraries elsewhere.\r\nProjekt Runeberg, for classic Nordic literature, and Projekt Gutenberg-\r\nDE, for classic German literature, started respectively in 1992 and\r\n1994.\r\n\r\nProjekt Runeberg was the first Swedish digital library of books from\r\npublic domain, and a partner of Project Gutenberg. It was created by\r\nthe students' computer club Lysator, in cooperation with Linkoeping\r\nUniversity, as a volunteer project to produce and organize free\r\nelectronic editions of classic Nordic (Scandinavian) literature. Around\r\n200 ebooks were available in 1998, with a list of 6,000 Nordic authors\r\nas a tool for further collection development.\r\n\r\nProjekt Gutenberg-DE was the first German digital library of books from\r\npublic domain, and also a partner of Project Gutenberg. A number of\r\ntexts were available for online reading in 1998, with one web page for\r\nshort texts and several web pages - one per chapter - for longer works.\r\nThere was an alphabetic list of authors and titles, with a short\r\nbiography and bibliography for each author.\r\n\r\n# In 1997\r\n\r\nFrench was the second language of Project Gutenberg, and still is in\r\n2010.\r\n\r\nThe first ebooks released in French were six works by Stendhal and two\r\nworks by Jules Verne, all released in early 1997.\r\n\r\nThe six works by Stendhal were four short novels: L'Abbesse de Castro\r\n(published in 1837), Les Cenci (1837), Vittoria Accoramboni (1837) and\r\nLa Duchesse de Palliano (1838), and two novels:  Le Rouge et le Noir\r\n(1830) and La Chartreuse de Parme (1839).\r\n\r\nThe two novels by Jules Verne were: De la terre a la lune (1865) and Le\r\ntour du monde en quatre-vingts jours (1873).\r\n\r\nThree novels by Jules Verne were already available in English: From the\r\nEarth to the Moon (original title: De la terre a la lune), released in\r\nSeptember 1993; Around the World in 80 Days (original title: Le tour du\r\nmonde en quatre-vingts jours), released in January 1994; and 20,000\r\nLeagues Under the Seas (original title: Vingt mille lieues sous les\r\nmers, 1869-70), released in September 1994.\r\n\r\nSince then, Jules Verne has constantly been in the most downloaded\r\nauthors, at 11 in the \"Top 20\" available on the website of Project\r\nGutenberg in December 1999, and at 6 in the \"Top 100 during the last 30\r\ndays\", on October 7, 2010.\r\n\r\nAs a side remark, the first pictures ever made available in Project\r\nGutenberg were French Cave Paintings, released in April 1995 as eBook\r\n#249, with an XHTML version available in November 2000. This ebook\r\noffers four copyrighted photographs of paleolithic paintings found in a\r\ngrotto in Ardeche, a region of south-western France. The photographs\r\nwere sent to Project Gutenberg by Jean Clottes, a general curator for\r\ncultural heritage (conservateur general du patrimoine), for everyone to\r\nenjoy them.\r\n\r\nReleased in August 1997, eBook #1000 was La Divina Commedia (1321) de\r\nDante Alighieri, in Italian, its original language.\r\n\r\n# In 1998\r\n\r\nIn October 1997, Michael Hart expressed his intention to produce more\r\nebooks in other languages. In early 1998, there were a few titles in\r\nFrench, German, Italian, Spanish, and Latin.\r\n\r\nStendhal and Jules Verne were followed by Edmond Rostand with Cyrano de\r\nBergerac, published in 1897 and released in Project Gutenberg 100 years\r\nlater, in March 1998.\r\n\r\n# In 1999\r\n\r\nReleased in May 1999, eBook #2000 was Don Quijote (1605), by Cervantes,\r\nin Spanish, its original language.\r\n\r\nIn July 1999, Michael Hart wrote in an email interview: \"I am\r\npublishing in one new language per month right now, and will continue\r\nas long as possible.\"\r\n\r\n# In 2000\r\n\r\nReleased in December 2000, eBook #3000 was A l'ombre des jeunes filles\r\nen fleurs (In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower), vol. 3 (1919), by\r\nMarcel Proust, in French, its original language.\r\n\r\n# In 2001\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg Australia was launched in July 2001, and began\r\nproducing ebooks in English and in other languages, for example some\r\nvolumes in French of A la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost\r\nTime, 1913-27) by Marcel Proust. (The last volumes of Proust's\r\nmasterpiece are still copyrighted in the United States, the reason why\r\nthey are lacking in Project Gutenberg's main website.) 1,750 ebooks\r\nwere available in Project Gutenberg Australia in February 2009.\r\n\r\nReleased in October 2001, eBook #4000 was The French Immortals Series\r\n(1905), in English. This book is an anthology of short fictions by\r\nauthors from the French Academy (Academie francaise): Emile Souvestre,\r\nPierre Loti, Hector Malot, Charles de Bernard, Alphonse Daudet, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n# In 2002\r\n\r\nReleased in April 2002, eBook #5000 was The Notebooks of Leonardo da\r\nVinci (early 16th century), as an English translation from Italian, its\r\noriginal language. Since its release, this ebook has regularly stayed\r\nin the \"Top 100\" of downloaded ebooks.\r\n\r\n# In 2003\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC) was affiliated with\r\nProject Gutenberg in 2003, and became a sister project. Since 1997,\r\nPGCC has been working on gathering collections of ebooks from other\r\nsources, in a number of formats and languages, with 75,000 ebooks in\r\n2010.\r\n\r\n# In 2004\r\n\r\nIn early 2004, there were works in 25 languages in Project Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nIn February 2004, Michael Hart went off to Europe, with stops in Paris,\r\nFrance; Brussels, Belgium; and Belgrade, Serbia.\r\n\r\nHe gave a lecture on February 12, 2004 at the headquarters of UNESCO\r\n(United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) in\r\nParis. He chaired a discussion at the French National Assembly on\r\nFebruary 13.\r\n\r\nThe following week, he addressed the European Parliament, in Brussels.\r\n\r\nThen he went to Belgrade to meet with the team of Project Rastko and\r\nsupport the launching of Project Gutenberg Europe and Distributed\r\nProofreaders Europe.\r\n\r\nProject Rastko, a non-governmental cultural and educational project,\r\nwas founded in 1997 in Belgrade as part of the Balkans Cultural Network\r\nInitiative, a regional network for the Balkan peninsula in south-\r\neastern Europe.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) has used the software of\r\nthe original Distributed Proofreaders, created in 2000 by Charles\r\nFranks to share the correction of ebooks among many volunteers.\r\n\r\nDP Europe has offered a plurilingual interface right from the start,\r\nwith its main pages translated into 12 European languages by volunteer\r\ntranslators as soon as April 2004. The long-term goal was 60 languages,\r\nfor the interface to be available in most European languages.\r\n\r\n# In 2005\r\n\r\nIn May 2005, DP Europe finished processing its 100th ebook. These\r\nebooks were in several languages, as a reflection of European\r\nlinguistic diversity. DP Europe has supported Unicode to be able to\r\nproofread ebooks in many languages. 600 ebooks were available in\r\nFebruary 2009.\r\n\r\nIn July 2005, there were works in 42 languages in Project Gutenberg,\r\nincluding Sanskrit and the Mayan languages. The seven main languages\r\nwere English (with 14,548 ebooks on July 27, 2005), French (577\r\nebooks), German (349 ebooks), Finnish (218 ebooks), Dutch (130 ebooks),\r\nSpanish (103 ebooks), and Chinese (69 ebooks).\r\n\r\n# In 2006\r\n\r\nReleased in December 2006, eBook #20000 was the audiobook of Twenty\r\nThousand Leagues Under the Sea (Vingt mille lieues sous les mers,\r\n1869), by Jules Verne,\r\nin its English version.\r\n\r\nIn December 2006, there were ebooks in 50 languages. The ten main\r\nlanguages were English (with 17,377 ebooks on December 16, 2006),\r\nFrench (966 ebooks), German (412 ebooks), Finnish (344 ebooks), Dutch\r\n(244 ebooks), Spanish (140 ebooks), Italian (102 ebooks), Chinese (69\r\nebooks), Portuguese (68 ebooks), and Tagalog (51 ebooks).\r\n\r\n# In 2007\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg Canada (PGC) was launched on July 1st, 2007, on\r\nCanada Day. Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) started production in\r\nDecember 2007, with 100 ebooks in English, French, and Italian in March\r\n2008, and 250 ebooks in February 2009.\r\n\r\n# In 2010\r\n\r\nOn October 7, 2010, there were works in 59 languages in Project\r\nGutenberg. The ten  main languages were English (with 28,441 ebooks),\r\nFrench (1,659 ebooks), German (709 ebooks), Finnish (536 ebooks), Dutch\r\n(496 ebooks), Portuguese (473 ebooks), Chinese (405 ebooks), Spanish\r\n(295 ebooks), Italian (250 ebooks), and Greek (101 ebooks). They were\r\nfollowed by Latin, Esperanto, Swedish, and Tagalog.\r\n\r\n# In 2020, may be\r\n\r\nIt is hoped machine translation software will be able to convert the\r\nebooks from one to another of many languages.\r\n\r\nIn ten years from now, machine translation may be judged 99%\r\nsatisfactory - research is active on that front, and software is\r\nquickly improving - allowing for the reading of literary classics in a\r\nchoice of many languages.\r\n\r\nThe machine translated ebooks won't compete with the work of literary\r\ntranslators and their labor of love during days and months if not\r\nyears, but they would allow readers to get the gist of some literary\r\nworks that have never been translated so far, or only translated in a\r\nfew languages, for commercial reasons.\r\n\r\nThe output of translation software could then be proofread by human\r\ntranslators, in a similar way the output of OCR software is proofread\r\nby the volunteers of Distributed Proofreaders.\r\n\r\nSo, may be, we will see Distributed Translators one day, as a partner\r\nor sister project of Distributed Proofreaders and Project Gutenberg?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL PROYECTO GUTENBERG Y LOS IDIOMAS [ES]\r\n\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg ofrece libros digitales en ingles en su gran\r\nmayoria, pero el multilingueismo es una de sus prioridades. El frances\r\nes el segundo idioma del proyecto. Las collecciones reunen libros en 60\r\nidiomas - incluso en espanol - en diciembre de 2010.\r\n\r\n# En 1990-1994\r\n\r\nAl principio los libros digitales estan en ingles. Como el Proyecto\r\nGutenberg  fue lanzado desde la Universidad de Illinois (Estados\r\nUnidos), con la ayuda de voluntarios de habla inglesa, su proposito\r\ninicial es proporcionar libros a la comunidad anglofona, es decir el\r\n95% de los usuarios del internet a principios de 1990. (Los non\r\nanglofonos representaran el 50% de los usuarios en el verano de 2000,\r\ncon un porcentaje que seguira creciendo durante los anos siguientes.)\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg tambien inspira dos otras bibliotecas digitales\r\nen Europa, el Projekt Runeberg en 1992 para la literatura nordica y el\r\nProjekt Gutenberg-DE en 1994 para la literatura alemana.\r\n\r\nEl Projekt Runeberg es la primera biblioteca digital sueca de libros\r\ndel dominio publico, y un socio del Proyecto Gutenberg. Esta biblioteca\r\nes creada en diciembre de 1992 por Lysator, un club informatico de\r\nestudiantes, en colaboracion con la biblioteca de la Universidad de\r\nLinkoeping (Suecia), para producir y organizar versiones electronicas\r\ngratuitas de obras de literatura nordica (escandinava) clasica. 200\r\nobras estan disponibles en 1998, con una lista de 6.000 autores\r\nnordicos para el desarrollo de las colecciones futuras.\r\n\r\nEl Projekt Gutenberg-DE es la primera biblioteca digital alemana de\r\nlibros del dominio publico, y tambien un socio del Proyecto Gutenberg.\r\nSe pueden leer decenas de textos en linea en 1998, con una pagina web\r\npara textos cortos y varias paginas web - uno por capitulo - para obras\r\nmas largas. Una lista alfabetica de autores y de titulos esta\r\ndisponible en el sitio, con una breve biografia y bibliografia para\r\ncada autor.\r\n\r\n# En 1997\r\n\r\nEl frances llego a ser la segunda lengua del Proyecto Gutenberg, y\r\nsigue siendolo en 2010.\r\n\r\nLos primeros libros en frances son seis obras de Stendhal y dos obras\r\nde Jules Verne, todas disponibles a principios de 1997.\r\n\r\nLas dos novelas de Jules Verne son: De la terre a la lune (1865) y Le\r\ntour du monde en quatre-vingts jours (1873).\r\n\r\nEn aquella fecha, tres novelas de Jules Verne ya estan disponibles en\r\ningles: From the Earth to the Moon (titulo original: De la terre a la\r\nlune), disponible en  septiembre de 1993; Around the World in 80 Days\r\n(titulo original: Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours), disponible\r\nen enero de 1994; y 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (titulo original:\r\nVingt mille lieues sous les mers, 1869-1870), disponible en septiembre\r\nde 1994.\r\n\r\nDesde la publicacion de estos primeros libros digitales, Jules Verne\r\nsiempre ha sido parte de los autores mas descargados. Era el undecimo\r\nautor en el \"Top 20 de autores\" mas descargados en diciembre de 1999.\r\nEra el sexto autor en el \"Top 100 de autores\" mas descargados en los\r\nultimos treinta dias en la fecha del 15 de noviembre de 2010.\r\n\r\nEn agosto de 1997, el Proyecto Gutenberg pone en linea el eBook #1000,\r\nLa Divina Commedia (La Divina Comedia) de Dante Alighieri (publicada en\r\n1321), en italiano, su idioma original.\r\n\r\n# En 1998-2000\r\n\r\nEn octubre de 1997, Michael Hart anuncia su intencion de aumentar la\r\nproduccion de libros en otros idiomas que el ingles. A principios de\r\n1998, el catalogo incluye obras en aleman, espanol, frances, italiano y\r\nlatin.\r\n\r\nDisponible en mayo de 1999, el eBook #2000 es Don Quijote (1605), en\r\ncastellano, su idioma original.\r\n\r\nEn julio de 1999, Michael escribe en una entrevista por correo\r\nelectronico: \"Ahora anado un nuevo idioma cada mes, y voy a seguir\r\nhaciendolo todo el tiempo sea posible.\"\r\n\r\nDisponible en diciembre de 2000, el eBook #3000 es el tercer volumen de\r\nA l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs (A la sombra de las muchachas en\r\nflor, 1919) de Marcel Proust, en frances, su idioma original.\r\n\r\n# En 2001\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg Australia - creado en julio de 2001 - inaugura la\r\nproduccion de libros digitales en ingles y en otros idiomas, por\r\nejemplo algunos volumenes en frances de A la recherche du temps perdu\r\n(En busca del tiempo perdido, 1913-1927) de Marcel Proust. (Los ultimos\r\nvolumenes todavia estan bajo copyright en los Estados Unidos, y no\r\nestan disponibles en el Proyecto Gutenberg). El Proyecto Gutenberg\r\nAustralia cuenta con 1.750 ebooks en febrero de 2009.\r\n\r\nDisponible en octubre de 2001, el eBook #4000 es The French Immortals\r\nSeries (Obras de los Inmortales franceses), en su version inglesa.\r\nPublicado en 1905 por la Maison Mazarin (Paris), este libro reune\r\nvarias obras cortas de ficcion de escritores laureados por la Academia\r\nde la Lengua Francesa (Academie Francaise), como Emile Souvestre,\r\nPierre Loti, Hector Malot, Charles de Bernard, Alphonse Daudet y otros.\r\n\r\n# En 2002\r\n\r\nDisponible en abril de 2002, el eBook #5000 es The Notebooks of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci (Los Cuadernos de Leonardo da Vinci), en una\r\ntraduccion del italiano al ingles de este texto del siglo 16. Desde su\r\npuesta en linea, este ebook  figura con regularidad en el \"Top 100\" de\r\nlos libros mas descargados.\r\n\r\n# En 2003\r\n\r\nEl Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC) - lanzado en 1997 para\r\nreunir en un punto de acceso unico colecciones de otras bibliotecas -\r\nesta afiliado oficialmente al Proyecto Gutenberg en 2003. Este sitio\r\nofrece mas de 75.000 ebooks en varios formatos e idiomas en noviembre\r\nde 2010.\r\n\r\n# En 2004\r\n\r\nA principios de 2004, 25 lenguas estan representadas en el Proyecto\r\nGutenberg.\r\n\r\nEn febrero de 2004, Michael Hart vuela a Europa con escalas en Bruselas\r\n(Belgica), Paris (Francia) y Belgrado (Serbia). El 12 de febrero de\r\n2004 da una conferencia en la sede de la UNESCO (Organizacion de las\r\nNaciones Unidas para la Educacion, la Ciencia y la Cultura) en Paris.\r\nAl dia siguiente, anima un debate en la Asamblea Nacional Francesa. La\r\nsemana siguiente hace un discurso ante el Parlamento Europeo en\r\nBruselas.\r\n\r\nDespues Michael se va a reune con el equipo del Proyecto Rastko en\r\nBelgrado para apoyar el lanzamiento del Proyecto Gutenberg Europa y de\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europa. El Proyecto Rastko es una organizacion\r\nno gubernamental  con vocacion cultural y educativa fundada en 1997\r\ncomo parte de una red cultural regional en la Peninsula de los\r\nBalcanes, en el sureste de Europa.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europa (DP Europa) utiliza el software y la\r\ninterfaz de Distributed Proofreaders, un sitio creado en octubre de\r\n2000 por Charles Franks para repartir la revision de los libros\r\ndigitales entre muchos voluntarios.\r\n\r\nDesde sus inicios, DP Europe es un sitio plurilinguee que toma en cuenta\r\nlas mayores lenguas nacionales europeas. Traducido por traductores\r\nvoluntarios, el sitio de DP Europa esta disponible en doce idiomas en\r\nabril de 2004, con la intencion de proponer la interfaz en sesenta\r\nidiomas, es decir todos los (mayores) idiomas europeos.\r\n\r\nEn mayo de 2005, DP Europa completa la correccion de su centesimo libro\r\ndigital. Estos libros estan en varios idiomas con el fin de reflejar la\r\ndiversidad lingueistica que prevalece en Europa. La codificacion\r\nutilizada es el Unicode para corregir libros en  muchos idiomas. DP\r\nEuropa cuenta con 600 libros en febrero de 2009.\r\n\r\n# En 2005\r\n\r\nEn julio de 2005, 42 lenguas estan representadas en el Proyecto\r\nGutenberg, incluyendo el sanscrito y las lenguas mayas. Los siete\r\nprincipales idiomas son el ingles (con 14.548 ebooks el 27 de julio\r\n2005), el frances (577 ebooks), en aleman (349 ebooks), el finlandes\r\n(218 ebooks), el holandes (130 ebooks), el espanol (103 ebooks) y el\r\nchino (69 ebooks).\r\n\r\n# En 2006\r\n\r\nDisponible en diciembre de 2006, el eBook #20000 es Twenty Thousand\r\nLeagues Under the Sea (Veinte mil leguas de viaje submarino, 1869), en\r\nuna version audio en ingles.\r\n\r\nEn diciembre de 2006, 50 lenguas estan representadas en el Proyecto\r\nGutenberg. Los diez principales idiomas son el ingles (con 17.377\r\nebooks el 16 de diciembre 2006), el frances (966 ebooks), el aleman\r\n(412 ebooks), el finlandes (344 ebooks), el holandes (244 ebooks), el\r\nespanol (140 ebooks), el italiano (102 ebooks), el chino (69 ebooks),\r\nel portugues (68 ebooks) y el tagalo (51 ebooks).\r\n\r\n# En 2007\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg Canada (PGC) es creado el 1 de julio de 2007, el\r\ndia de la fiesta nacional de Canada. Distributed Proofreaders Canada\r\n(DPC) inicia su produccion de libros en diciembre de 2007, con 100\r\nlibros en ingles, en frances y en italiano disponibles en marzo de\r\n2008, y 250 libros disponibles en febrero de 2009.\r\n\r\n# En 2010\r\n\r\nEn octubre de 2010, 59 lenguas estan representadas en el Proyecto\r\nGutenberg. Los diez principales idiomas son el ingles (con 28.441\r\nebooks el 7 de octubre 2010), el frances (1.659 ebooks), el aleman (709\r\nebooks), el finlandes (536 ebooks), el holandes (496 ebooks), el\r\nportugues (473 ebooks), el chino (405 ebooks), el espanol (295 ebooks),\r\nel italiano (250 ebooks) y el griego (101 ebooks). Estos idiomas son\r\nseguidos por el latin, el esperanto, el sueco y el tagalo.\r\n\r\n# En 2020, quizas\r\n\r\nQuizas podamos beneficiar en el futuro de la traduccion inmediata de\r\nestos libros a una gran variedad de idiomas, a traves de un software de\r\ntraduccion automatica.\r\n\r\nEn diez anos, la traduccion automatica podria haber logrado un\r\nporcentaje de fiabilidad del 99% - la investigacion es muy activa en\r\neste campo, y los softwares son cada vez mejores - con capacidad de\r\nleer obras literarias en un gran numero de idiomas.\r\n\r\nLos libros traducidos por un software de traduccion automatica no van a\r\ncompetir con el trabajo de los traductores literarios y sus esfuerzos\r\ntalentosos durante dias y meses si no anos. Pero van a permitir al\r\nlector captar lo esencial de obras literarias nunca traducidas, o\r\ntraducidas solo a unos pocos idiomas por razones comerciales.\r\n\r\nUn libro traducido por un software de traduccion podra a continuacion\r\nser corregido por traductores (seres humanos) mediante el uso de una\r\ninterfaz similar a la que utilizan ahora los voluntarios de Distributed\r\nProofreaders para la correccion de un libro digital producido por un\r\nsoftware de OCR (reconocimiento optico de caracteres).\r\n\r\nAsi pues, uno empieza a sonar con Distributed Translators para\r\ncompartir la revision de las traducciones, como un socio de Distributed\r\nProofreaders y del Proyecto Gutenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLE PROJET GUTENBERG ET LES LANGUES [FR]\r\n\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg propose essentiellement des livres numeriques en\r\nanglais, mais le multilinguisme est l'une de ses priorites. Le francais\r\nest la deuxieme langue du projet. Soixante langues sont representees en\r\ndecembre 2010.\r\n\r\n# En 1990-1994\r\n\r\nA l'origine, les livres numeriques sont en anglais. Comme le Projet\r\nGutenberg est lance a partir de l'Universite de l'Illinois (Etats-\r\nUnis), avec l'aide de volontaires anglophones, son but premier est de\r\nprocurer des livres a la communaute anglophone, a savoir 95% des\r\nusagers de l'internet au debut des annees 1990. (Les usagers non\r\nanglophones atteignent les 50% en ete 2000, avec un pourcentage qui\r\naugmente regulierement ensuite.)\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg inspire aussi d'autres bibliotheques numeriques\r\nailleurs, a savoir le Projekt Runeberg pour la litterature nordique\r\n(scandinave) en 1992 et le Projekt Gutenberg-DE pour la litterature\r\nallemande en 1994.\r\n\r\nLe Projekt Runeberg est la premiere bibliotheque numerique suedoise de\r\nlivres du domaine public, et un partenaire du Projet Gutenberg. Elle\r\nest creee en decembre 1992 par Lysator, un club informatique\r\nd'etudiants, en collaboration avec la bibliotheque de l'Universite de\r\nLinkoeping (Suede), pour produire et organiser des versions\r\nelectroniques gratuites de la litterature nordique classique. 200\r\noeuvres sont disponibles en 1998, avec une liste de 6.000 auteurs\r\nnordiques en tant qu'outil de developpement des collections.\r\n\r\nProjekt Gutenberg-DE est la premiere bibliotheque numerique allemande\r\nde livres du domaine public, et egalement un partenaire du Projet\r\nGutenberg. Plusieurs dizaines de textes peuvent etre lus en ligne en\r\n1998, avec une page web pour les textes courts et plusieurs pages - une\r\npar chapitre - pour les oeuvres plus longues. Une liste alphabetique\r\nd'auteurs et de titres est egalement disponible, ainsi qu'une courte\r\nbiographie et bibliographie pour chaque auteur.\r\n\r\n# En 1997\r\n\r\nLe francais fut la deuxieme langue du Projet Gutenberg, et c'est\r\ntoujours le cas en 2010.\r\n\r\nLes premiers livres disponibles en francais sont six oeuvres de\r\nStendhal et deux oeuvres de Jules Verne, toutes mises en ligne debut\r\n1997.\r\n\r\nLes six oeuvres de Stendhal sont quatre recits: Les Cenci (publie en\r\n1837), Vittoria Accoramboni (1837), La Duchesse de Palliano (1838) et\r\nL'Abbesse de Castro (1839) - tous recits publies dans La revue des deux\r\nmondes - et deux romans: Le Rouge et le Noir (1830) et La Chartreuse de\r\nParme (1839).\r\n\r\nLes deux romans de Jules Verne sont: De la terre a la lune (1865) et Le\r\ntour du monde en quatre-vingts jours (1873).\r\n\r\nA cette date, trois romans de Jules Verne sont deja disponibles en\r\nanglais: From the Earth to the Moon (titre original: De la terre a la\r\nlune), disponible en  septembre 1993; Around the World in 80 Days\r\n(titre original: Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours), disponible\r\nen janvier 1994; et 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas (titre original:\r\nVingt mille lieues sous les mers, 1869-1870), disponible en septembre\r\n1994.\r\n\r\nDepuis la parution de ces premiers titres, Jules Verne a toujours fait\r\npartie des auteurs les plus telecharges, a la onzieme place dans le\r\n\"Top 20\" du Projet Gutenberg en decembre 1999 et a la sixieme place\r\ndans le \"Top 100\" des auteurs les plus telecharges durant les trente\r\nderniers jours a la date du 6 novembre 2010.\r\n\r\nA titre anecdotique, le premier recueil d'images disponible dans le\r\nProjet Gutenberg toutes langues confondues est French Cave Paintings\r\n(Peintures des cavernes en France), mis en ligne des avril 1995 (eBook\r\n#249), avec une version XHTML ajoutee en novembre 2000. Il s'agit de\r\nquatre photos de peintures paleolithiques retrouvees dans une grotte de\r\nl'Ardeche, un departement du sud-ouest de la France. Ces photos, sous\r\ncopyright, ont ete mises a la disposition du Projet Gutenberg par Jean\r\nClottes, conservateur general du patrimoine, pour pouvoir etre\r\nappreciees de tous.\r\n\r\nDisponible en 1997, l'eBook #1000 est La Divina Commedia (1321) de\r\nDante Alighieri, en italien, sa langue originale.\r\n\r\n# En 1998\r\n\r\nEn octobre 1997, Michael Hart annonce son intention d'intensifier la\r\nproduction de livres dans des langues autres que l'anglais. Debut 1998,\r\nle catalogue comprend quelques oeuvres en allemand, en espagnol, en\r\nfrancais (dix titres), en italien et en latin.\r\n\r\nStendhal et Jules Verne sont suivis par Edmond Rostand avec Cyrano de\r\nBergerac, publie en 1897 et disponible dans le Projet Gutenberg un\r\nsiecle plus tard, en  mars 1998.\r\n\r\n# En 1999\r\n\r\nDisponible en mai 1999, l'eBook #2000 est Don Quijote (1605) de\r\nCervantes, en espagnol, sa langue originale.\r\n\r\nEn juillet 1999, Michael ecrit lors d'un entretien par courriel:\r\n\"J'introduis une nouvelle langue par mois maintenant, et je vais\r\npoursuivre cette politique aussi longtemps que possible.\"\r\n\r\n# En 2000\r\n\r\nDisponible en decembre 2000, l'eBook #3000 est le volume 3 (1919) de A\r\nl'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs de Marcel Proust, en francais, sa\r\nlangue originale.\r\n\r\nLe Project Gutenberg Australia est lance en juillet 2001, et commence a\r\nproduire des livres numeriques en anglais et dans d'autres langues, par\r\nexemple certains volumes en francais de A la recherche du temps perdu\r\n(1913-1927) de Marcel Proust. (Les derniers volumes sont toujours sous\r\ncopyright aux Etats-Unis, raison pour laquelle ils ne sont pas\r\ndisponibles sur le site americain du Projet Gutenberg.) Les collections\r\ndu Project Gutenberg Australia comprennent 1.750 livres numeriques en\r\nfevrier 2009.\r\n\r\n# En 2001\r\n\r\nDisponible en octobre 2001, l'eBook #4000 est The French Immortals\r\nSeries  (Recueil de textes d'Immortels francais, 1905), en anglais.\r\nCette anthologie regroupe des oeuvres de fiction courtes de plusieurs\r\nmembres de l'Academie francaise: Emile Souvestre, Pierre Loti, Hector\r\nMalot, Charles de Bernard, Alphonse Daudet et d'autres.\r\n\r\n# En 2002\r\n\r\nDisponible en avril 2002, l'eBook #5000 est The Notebooks of Leonardo\r\nda Vinci (Les carnets de Leonard de Vinci), un version anglaise de ces\r\ncarnets datant du 16e siecle. Ce livre est depuis regulierement present\r\ndans le \"Top 100\" des livres telecharges.\r\n\r\n# En 2003\r\n\r\nLe Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC) - fonde en 1997 pour\r\nregrouper des collections de livres numeriques emanant d'autres sources\r\n- est affilie au Projet Gutenberg en 2003 et devient l'un de ses sites\r\nofficiels. Il propose plus de 75.000 titres dans divers formats et en\r\nplusieurs langues en decembre 2010.\r\n\r\n# En 2004\r\n\r\nDebut 2004, 25 langues sont representees dans le Projet Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nEn fevrier 2004, Michael Hart prend l'avion vers l'Europe, avec des\r\netapes a Bruxelles (Belgique), Paris (France) et Belgrade (Serbie).\r\n\r\nLe 12 fevrier 2004, il donne une conference au siege de l'UNESCO\r\n(Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'education, la science et la\r\nculture) a Paris. Le lendemain, toujours a Paris, il anime un debat a\r\nl'Assemblee nationale. La semaine suivante, il s'adresse au Parlement\r\neuropeen a Bruxelles. Puis il va rendre visite a l'equipe du Projet\r\nRastko a Belgrade pour soutenir le lancement du Projet Gutenberg Europe\r\net de Distributed Proofreaders Europe.\r\n\r\nLe Projet Rastko est un projet non gouvernemental a vocation culturelle\r\net pedagogique fonde en 1997 et faisant partie d'un reseau culturel\r\nregional dans la peninsule des Balkans, situee au sud-est de l'Europe.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) est calque sur le site\r\noriginal de Distributed Proofreaders, un site cree en octobre 2000 par\r\nCharles Franks pour partager la correction des livres entre de nombreux\r\nvolontaires.\r\n\r\nDes ses debuts, DP Europe est un site plurilingue, avec prise en compte\r\ndes principales langues nationales europeennes. Grace a des traducteurs\r\nvolontaires, le site de DP Europe est disponible en douze langues des\r\navril 2004. L'objectif a long terme est une interface disponible en\r\nsoixante langues, a savoir la plupart des langues europeennes.\r\n\r\n# En 2005\r\n\r\nEn mai 2005, DP Europe termine la correction de son centieme livre. Ces\r\nlivres sont en plusieurs langues, en tant que reflet de la diversite\r\ndes langues en Europe. L'encodage utilise est l'Unicode, pour pouvoir\r\ntraiter des livres dans de nombreuses langues. 600 livres sont\r\ndisponibles en fevrier 2009.\r\n\r\nEn juillet 2005, 42 langues sont representees dans le Projet Gutenberg,\r\ny compris le sanscrit et les langues mayas. Les sept langues\r\nprincipales sont l'anglais (avec 14.548 ebooks le 27 juillet 2005), le\r\nfrancais (577 ebooks),  l'allemand (349 ebooks), le finnois (218\r\nebooks), le neerlandais (130 ebooks),  l'espagnol (103 ebooks) et le\r\nchinois (69 ebooks).\r\n\r\n# En 2006\r\n\r\nDisponible en decembre 2006, l'eBook #20000 est Twenty Thousand Leagues\r\nUnder the Sea (Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, 1869) de Jules Verne,\r\ndans une version audio en langue anglaise.\r\n\r\nEn decembre 2006, 50 langues sont representees dans le Projet\r\nGutenberg.

Distributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC)\r\ndebute ses activites en decembre 2007, avec 100 livres numeriques en\r\nanglais, en francais et en italien en mars 2008, et 250 livres en\r\nfevrier 2009.\r\n\r\n# En 2010\r\n\r\nEn novembre 2010, 60 langues sont representees dans le Projet\r\nGutenberg. Les dix langues principales sont l'anglais (avec 28.666\r\nebooks le 6 novembre 2010),  le francais (1.672 ebooks), l'allemand\r\n(715 ebooks), le finnois (542 ebooks), le neerlandais (498 ebooks), le\r\nportugais (474 ebooks), le chinois (405 ebooks), l'espagnol (297\r\nebooks), l'italien (253 ebooks) et le grec (107 ebooks). Ces langues\r\nsont suivies du latin, de l'esperanto, du suedois et du tagalog.\r\n\r\n# En 2020, peut-etre\r\n\r\nIl est possible qu'on puisse beneficier un jour de la traduction\r\nimmediate de ces livres dans un vaste choix de langues, par le biais\r\nd'un logiciel de traduction automatique.\r\n\r\nDans dix ans, la traduction automatique pourrait avoir atteint un taux\r\nde fiabilite de l'ordre de 99% - la recherche est tres active dans ce\r\ndomaine, avec des logiciels de plus en plus performants - avec\r\npossibilite de lire des oeuvres litteraires dans un grand nombre de\r\nlangues.\r\n\r\nLes livres traduits par le biais d'un logiciel de traduction\r\nautomatique ne rivaliseront certainement pas avec le travail des\r\ntraducteurs litteraires et leurs efforts talentueux pendant des jours\r\net des mois sinon des annees. Mais ils permettraient au lecteur une\r\npremiere approche d'oeuvres litteraires jamais traduites jusqu'ici, ou\r\ntraduites seulement dans quelques langues, pour des raisons\r\ncommerciales.\r\n\r\nLe texte d'un livre traduit (issu d'un logiciel de traduction) pourrait\r\nensuite etre corrige par des traducteurs (des etres humains, pas des\r\nlogiciels), en utilisant une interface semblable a celle utilisee\r\nactuellement pour la correction du texte d'un livre (issu d'un logiciel\r\nOCR) par les volontaires de Distributed Proofreaders.\r\n\r\nOn se prend ainsi a rever a un Distributed Translators pour partager la\r\nrevision des traductions, Distributed Translators pouvant etre un\r\norganisme partenaire de Distributed Proofreaders et du Projet\r\nGutenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS IS TEN YEARS OLD [EN]\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg got its first boost with the invention of the web in\r\n1990, and its second boost with the creation of Distributed\r\nProofreaders in 2000, to share the proofreading of digitized books\r\nbetween many volunteers. Volunteers choose a book currently processed\r\nthrough the site to proofread a given page, or several pages, as they\r\nwish. One page per day is a great goal. It doesn't seem much, but with\r\nhundreds of volunteers it really adds up.\r\n\r\n# A website launched in 2000\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders (DP) was founded in October 2000 by Charles\r\nFranks to support the digitization of public domain books. From the\r\nwebsite one can access a program that allows several proofreaders to be\r\nworking on the same book at the same time, each proofreading on\r\ndifferent pages. The goal is to all work together - from any region in\r\nthe world - to significantly speed up the proofreading process.\r\n\r\nOriginally conceived to assist Project Gutenberg (PG), Distributed\r\nProofreaders is now the main source of PG ebooks. In 2002, DP became an\r\nofficial PG site. In May 2006, DP became a separate legal entity and\r\ncontinues to maintain a strong relationship with PG.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders counted 3,000 ebooks \"preserved for the world\"\r\nin February 2004, 5,000 ebooks in October 2004, 7,000 ebooks in May\r\n2005, 10,000 ebooks in December 2006, 11,950 ebooks in January 2008,\r\nand 18,848 ebooks on 15 October 2010. Production was 196 titles in\r\nOctober 2010.\r\n\r\n# How all this works\r\n\r\nVolunteers register and receive detailed instructions. For example,\r\nwords in bold, italic or underlined, or footnotes are always treated\r\nthe same way for any ebook. A discussion forum allows them to ask\r\nquestions or seek help at any time.\r\n\r\nEach time proofreaders go to the website, they choose the book they\r\nwant. One page of the book appears in two forms side by side: the\r\nscanned image of one page, and the text from that image as produced by\r\nOCR software. The proofreader can easily compare both versions, note\r\nthe differences, and fix them. OCR is usually 99% accurate, which makes\r\nfor about 10 corrections a page. The proofreader saves the page as it\r\nis completed, and then can either stop work or do another.\r\n\r\nThe books are proofread twice, and the second time only by experienced\r\nproofreaders.\r\n\r\nAll the pages of the book are then formatted, combined and assembled by\r\npost-processors to make an ebook.\r\n\r\nA project manager oversees the progress of a particular book through\r\nits different steps on the website.\r\n\r\nThe ebook is now ready to be released in Project Gutenberg with an\r\nindex entry (title, subtitle, author, ebook number, and character set)\r\nfor the database. Catalogers go on with the cataloguing process\r\n(author's dates of birth and death, Library of Congress classification,\r\netc.) after the release.\r\n\r\n# Everyone is welcome\r\n\r\nNew volunteers are most welcome, and will be guided by experienced\r\nvolunteers for their first steps. There is a lot to do, and everyone is\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nAs stated on DP's website in 2005, \"Remember that there is no\r\ncommitment expected on this site. Proofread as often or as seldom as\r\nyou like, and as many or as few pages as you like. We encourage people\r\nto do 'a page a day', but it's entirely up to you! We hope you will\r\njoin us in our mission of 'preserving the literary history of the world\r\nin a freely available form for everyone to use'.\"\r\n\r\n# Distributed Proofreaders Europe\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) was launched in  early 2004\r\nby Project Rastko in Belgrade, Serbia, as well as Project Gutenberg\r\nEurope. DP Europe uses the software of the original Distributed\r\nProofreaders.\r\n\r\nSince its beginning, DP Europe has been a multilingual website, with\r\nits main pages translated into the main national European languages by\r\nvolunteer translators. DP Europe was available in 12 languages as early\r\nas April 2004. The long-term goal is 60 languages representing most\r\nEuropean languages.\r\n\r\nIn May 2005, DP Europe finished processing its 100th ebook. Ebooks were\r\nin several languages to reflect European linguistic diversity. 600\r\nebooks were ready in February 2009, and 732 ebooks on 15 October 2010.\r\n\r\nDP Europe supports Unicode to be able to proofread ebooks in numerous\r\nlanguages. Unicode is an encoding system created in 1991 that gives a\r\nunique number for every character in any language. Unicode is meant to\r\nreplace ASCII, an encoding system dating back from 1968 that can only\r\nhandle English and Latin in its \"original\" version, and a few European\r\nlanguages with accents in its \"extended\" version. In 2008, half of the\r\nfiles available on the internet were Unicode files.\r\n\r\n# Distributed Proofreaders Canada\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) started production in December\r\n2007, to digitize and proofread ebooks for Project Gutenberg Canada\r\n(PGC), founded on July 1st, 2007, on Canada Day, by Michael Shepard and\r\nDavid Jones. There were 100 ebooks in March 2008, in English, French\r\nand Italian. 250 ebooks were available in February 2009, and 427 books\r\non October 15, 2010.\r\n\r\n# A few numbers\r\n\r\n= Over 33,000 high-quality proofread ebooks in Project Gutenberg, in\r\nseveral languages. (Quality more than quantity is what really matters\r\nto the reader, believe me.)\r\n\r\n= 18,961 ebooks processed by Distributed Proofreaders (the original\r\nwebsite) on November 1st, 2010, since its creation in October 2000,\r\nwith 2,352 active volunteers in October 2010.\r\n\r\n= 739 ebooks processed by Distributed Proofreaders Europe on November\r\n1st, 2010, since its creation on January 2004.\r\n\r\n= 433 ebooks processed by Distributed Proofreaders Canada on November\r\n1st, 2010, since its creation in December 2007, with 127 active\r\nvolunteers in October 2010.\r\n\r\n# A few links\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg,\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/\r\nwith 33,000 high-quality proofread ebooks.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders,\r\nhttp://www.pgdp.net/c/\r\nlaunched in October 2000.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europe,\r\nhttp://dp.rastko.net/\r\nlaunched in early 2004, with a plurilingual interface, and books to\r\nproofread in several languages.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Canada,\r\nhttp://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/default.php\r\nlaunched in December 2007.\r\n\r\nVolunteers are most welcome on the three websites - with no geographic\r\nrequirements - because there are no borders for beautiful literary\r\nworks to be \"preserved for the world\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS TIENE 10 ANOS [ES]\r\n\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg cobra nuevo aliento y alcanza una difusion\r\ninternacional con la aparicion de la web en 1990, y luego con la\r\ncreacion de Distributed Proofreaders (Correctores Distribuidos) en\r\n2000, cuya meta es compartir la revision de los libros entre centenares\r\nde voluntarios. Los voluntarios eligen un libro digital que se esta\r\nprocesando en el sitio para releer y corregir determinada pagina, o\r\nalgunas paginas, como quieran. A titulo indicativo, se aconseja\r\ncorregir una pagina al dia. Representa poco tiempo en un dia, pero\r\nmucho para el proyecto. Una pagina multiplicada por cientos de\r\nvoluntarios representa un volumen considerable.\r\n\r\n# Un sitio lanzado en 2000\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders es concebido en octubre de 2000 por Charles\r\nFranks para  contribuir a la digitalizacion de los libros del dominio\r\npublico. La interfaz del sitio web da acceso a un software que permite\r\na varios voluntarios trabajar simultaneamente en el mismo libro, cada\r\nuno corrigiendo diferentes paginas. El objetivo es que todos trabajen\r\njuntos - desde cualquier lugar del mundo - para acelerar\r\nsignificativamente el proceso de revision de los libros.\r\n\r\nOriginalmente destinado a ayudar el Proyecto Gutenberg en su tarea,\r\nDistributed Proofreaders se convierte rapidamente en la principal\r\nfuente de sus ebooks. Despues de afiliarse con el Proyecto Gutenberg en\r\n2002, Distributed Proofreaders se convierte en una entidad\r\nindependiente en mayo de 2006, aunque manteniendo una estrecha relacion\r\ncon este.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders contabiliza 3.000 libros digitalizados y\r\ncorregidos en febrero de 2004, 5.000 libros en octubre de 2004, 7.000\r\nlibros en mayo de 2005, 10.000 libros en diciembre de 2006, 11.950\r\nlibros en enero de 2008 y 19.059 libros el 16 de noviembre de 2010. La\r\nproduccion es de 196 ebooks en octubre de 2010.\r\n\r\n# La organizacion practica del procesamiento\r\n\r\nEl nuevo voluntario empieza por registrarse. Recibe instrucciones\r\ndetalladas, por ejemplo como tratar las partes en negrita, en cursiva o\r\nsubrayadas, o las notas, que se tratan todas de la misma manera. Un\r\nforo permite formular preguntas y pedir ayuda en cualquier momento.\r\n\r\nCuando el voluntario inicia una sesion en el sitio, elige un libro a\r\npartir de  una lista dada. Una pagina del libro elegido aparece en dos\r\nversiones: por una parte la imagen digitalizada de la pagina, por otra\r\nel texto resultante de esta imagen, producido por un software de OCR\r\n(reconocimiento optico de caracteres). El voluntario compara las dos\r\nversiones y corrige las diferencias. Un software de OCR tiene una\r\nprecision del 99%, lo que representa un promedio de diez errores a\r\ncorregir por pagina. Luego el voluntario salva la pagina y puede cesar\r\nsu relectura o bien optar por la correccion de otra pagina.\r\n\r\nTodos los libros son revisados dos veces, y la segunda vez solo por\r\ncorrectores experimentados.\r\n\r\nOtros voluntarios llamados \"post-procesadores\" (\"post-processors\" en\r\ningles) formatean y montan las paginas corregidas, de acuerdo con\r\nnormas precisas, para obtener un ebook.\r\n\r\nDurante todo el proceso, un jefe de proyecto (llamado \"project manager\"\r\nen ingles) sigue el tratamiento de un libro dado para garantizar el\r\nbuen funcionamiento del proceso.\r\n\r\nA continuacion se pone en linea el ebook en el Proyecto Gutenberg\r\ndespues de su indexacion (titulo, subtitulo, autor, numero del ebook y\r\nformato de codificacion) por voluntarios indizadores. Catalogadores\r\nvoluntarios se encargan  luego de la catalogacion de este libro (fechas\r\nde nacimiento y  muerte del autor, clasificacion de la Biblioteca del\r\nCongreso, etc.).\r\n\r\n# Calquier participacion es bienvenida\r\n\r\nLos nuevos voluntarios son bienvenidos, en cualquier pais y para\r\ncualquier idioma, y seran guiados por voluntarios experimentados para\r\nsus primeros pasos como revisores. La tarea es inmensa, y cualquier\r\nayuda es muy apreciada.\r\n\r\nComo se indica en el sitio web en 2005, \"DP no espera su compromiso\r\nincondicional. Usted puede revisar textos todas las veces que quiera, y\r\nel numero de paginas que desee. Alentamos a la gente a corregir una\r\npagina por dia, pero usted esta totalmente libre de hacer lo que le\r\ngusta. Esperamos que usted se una a nuestra mision de 'preservar la\r\nliteratura mundial en una version gratuita y disponible para todos'.\"\r\n\r\n# Distributed Proofreaders Europa\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europa (DP Europa) - copiado a partir del\r\nsitio y del software original de Distributed Proofreaders - se lanza en\r\nenero de 2004 para gestionar la revision de los libros del Proyecto\r\nGutenberg Europa, a iniciativa del Proyecto Rastko, basado en Belgrado\r\n(Serbia).\r\n\r\nDesde sus inicios, DP Europa es un sitio web multilinguee, traducido por\r\nvoluntarios a los grandes idiomas nacionales europeos, y disponible en\r\ndoce idiomas en abril de 2004. El objetivo a largo plazo es una\r\ninterfaz en sesenta idiomas para tener en cuenta todas las (mayores)\r\nlenguas europeas.\r\n\r\nLos cien primeros libros estan disponibles en abril de 2005. Estos\r\nlibros estan en varios idiomas - de los cuales el espanol - con el fin\r\nde reflejar la diversidad lingueistica que prevalece en Europa. DP\r\nEuropa contabiliza 600 libros en febrero de 2009, y 741 libros el 16 de\r\nnoviembre de 2010.\r\n\r\nDP Europa utiliza el Unicode para poder procesar libros en varios\r\nidiomas. Unicode es un sistema de codificacion creado en 1991, que\r\nasigna un codigo unico para cada caracter de todos los idiomas del\r\nplaneta. Se sustituye poco a poco al ASCII, un sistema de codificacion\r\nque data de 1968 y que solo puede procesar el ingles y el latin en su\r\nversion \"original\", y algunos idiomas europeos con acentos en su\r\nversion \"extendida\". En 2008, 50% de los archivos disponibles en el\r\ninternet estan codificados en Unicode.\r\n\r\n# Distributed Proofreaders Canada\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Canada (PGC) se lanza en diciembre de 2007\r\npara la produccion de los ebooks del Proyecto Gutenberg Canada (PGC),\r\ncreado el 1 de julio de 2007, dia de la fiesta nacional, a instigacion\r\nde Michael Shepard y David Jones. Los cien primeros libros estan\r\ndisponibles en marzo de 2008, con libros en ingles, en frances y en\r\nitaliano. 250 libros estan disponibles en febrero de 2009, y 441 libros\r\nel 16 de noviembre de 2010.\r\n\r\n# Algunas cifras\r\n\r\n= Mas de 33.000 ebooks en el Proyecto Gutenberg, todos revisados dos\r\nveces, y en varios idiomas. El objetivo es mas la calidad que la\r\ncantidad.\r\n\r\n= 19.059 ebooks procesados por Distributed Proofreaders (el sitio\r\noriginal, basado en los Estados Unidos) el 16 de noviembre de 2010,\r\ndesde su lanzamiento en octubre de 2000, y 2.352 voluntarios activos\r\ndurante el mes de octubre de 2010.\r\n\r\n= 741 ebooks procesados por Distributed Proofreaders Europa el 16 de\r\nnoviembre de 2010, desde su lanzamiento en enero de 2004.\r\n\r\n= 441 ebooks procesados por Distributed Proofreaders Canada el 16 de\r\nnoviembre de 2010, desde su lanzamiento en diciembre de 2007, con 127\r\nvoluntarios activos durante el mes de octubre de 2010.\r\n\r\n# Algunos enlaces\r\n\r\nEl Proyecto Gutenberg,\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders,\r\nhttp://www.pgdp.net/c/\r\nque tiene 10 anos.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europa,\r\nhttp://dp.rastko.net/\r\nel proyecto europeo lanzado en enero de 2004, con una interfaz en\r\nvarios idiomas, incluso en espanol.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Canada,\r\nhttp://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/default.php\r\nlanzado en diciembre de 2007.\r\n\r\nLos voluntarios de todos los paises son bienvenidos en los tres sitios\r\n- sin preferencia geografica o lingueistica - porque la buena literatura\r\nno tiene fronteras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS A DIX ANS [FR]\r\n\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg trouve un second souffle et un rayonnement\r\ninternational avec l'apparition du web en 1990 puis la creation de\r\nDistributed Proofreaders en 2000, pour partager la relecture des livres\r\nentre des centaines de volontaires. Les volontaires choisissent un\r\nlivre en cours de traitement pour relire et corriger une page donnee,\r\nou bien plusieurs. A titre indicatif, il est conseille de relire une\r\npage par jour. C'est peu de temps sur une journee, et c'est beaucoup\r\npour le projet. Une page multipliee par des centaines de volontaires\r\nrepresente un chiffre considerable.\r\n\r\n# Un site lance en 2000\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders est concu en octobre 2000 par Charles Franks\r\npour contribuer a la numerisation des livres du domaine public. A\r\npartir du site web, on accede a un logiciel permettant a plusieurs\r\ncorrecteurs de travailler simultanement au meme livre, chacun\r\ntravaillant sur des pages differentes, le but etant bien sur de\r\ntravailler ensemble - de n'importe quelle region du monde - pour\r\naccelerer de maniere sensible le processus de revision des livres.\r\n\r\nCense a l'origine aider le Projet Gutenberg dans sa tache, Distributed\r\nProofreaders devient rapidement la principale source des livres du\r\nProjet Gutenberg. Apres avoir ete affilie au Projet Gutenberg en 2002,\r\nil devient une entite independante en mai 2006, tout en conservant des\r\nliens etroits avec le Projet Gutenberg.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders comptabilise 3.000 livres numerises et\r\ncorriges en fevrier 2004, 5.000 livres en octobre 2004, 7.000 livres en\r\nmai 2005, 10.000 livres en decembre 2006, 11.950 livres en janvier 2008\r\net 18.848 livres le 15 octobre 2010. La production etait de 196 livres\r\nen octobre 2010.\r\n\r\n# Comment cela se passe, pratiquement\r\n\r\nLe volontaire relecteur commence par s'inscrire. Il recoit des\r\ndirectives detaillees. Ces directives concernent par exemple les\r\nparties en gras, en italique et soulignees, ou les notes, qui sont\r\ntoutes traitees de la meme maniere. Un forum permet de poser des\r\nquestions et de demander de l'aide a tout moment.\r\n\r\nQuand le relecteur se connecte au site, il selectionne le livre de son\r\nchoix a partir d'une liste donnee. Une page du livre choisi apparait\r\nsimultanement dans deux versions: d'une part l'image scannee, d'autre\r\npart le texte issu de cette image, produit par un logiciel OCR. Le\r\nrelecteur compare les deux versions et corrige les differences. Un\r\nlogiciel OCR etant fiable a 99%, cela represente une moyenne de dix\r\nerreurs a corriger par page. Le relecteur sauvegarde ensuite la page,\r\net peut ensuite soit cesser le travail, soit opter pour la correction\r\nd'une autre page.\r\n\r\nTous les livres sont relus et corriges deux fois de suite et, la\r\ndeuxieme fois, uniquement par des correcteurs experimentes.\r\n\r\nLes pages corrigees sont ensuite formatees et assemblees selon des\r\nregles precises par d'autres volontaires (appeles \"post-processors\")\r\npour obtenir un ebook.\r\n\r\nDurant la totalite du processus, le traitement d'un livre donne est\r\nsuivi par un responsable (appele \"project manager\"), qui s'assure du\r\nbon deroulement des operations.\r\n\r\nApres la mise en forme suit la mise en ligne sur le Projet Gutenberg,\r\navec indexation du livre (titre, sous-titre, auteur, numero de l'ebook\r\net format d'encodage) par d'autres volontaires puis catalogage\r\ncomplementaire (dates de naissance et mort de l'auteur, classification\r\nde la Library of Congress, etc.) ensuite.\r\n\r\n# Toute participation est bienvenue\r\n\r\nDe nouveaux volontaires sont bienvenus, dans tout pays et pour toute\r\nlangue, y compris pour les livres en francais, et seront guides par des\r\nvolontaires experimentes pour leurs premiers pas en tant que reviseurs.\r\nLa tache est immense, et toute aide est tres appreciee.\r\n\r\nComme indique sur le site en 2005, \"DP ne s'attend pas a un engagement\r\ninconditionnel de votre part. Corrigez des textes aussi souvent que\r\nvous le voulez, et le nombre de pages que vous voulez. Nous\r\nencourageons les gens a corriger une page par jour, mais vous etes tout\r\na fait libre de faire ce qui vous plait. Nous esperons que vous vous\r\njoindrez a notre mission de \"preserver la litterature mondiale dans une\r\nversion gratuite et disponible pour tous\".\"\r\n\r\n# Distributed Proofreaders Europe\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europe (DP Europe) - calque sur le site\r\noriginal de Distributed Proofreaders, dont il utilise le logiciel - est\r\nlance en janvier 2004 pour gerer la relecture partagee du Projet\r\nGutenberg Europe, sous l'egide du Projet Rastko a Belgrade (Serbie).\r\n\r\nDes ses debuts, DP Europe est un site multilingue. Ses pages\r\nprincipales sont traduites dans les grandes langues nationales\r\neuropeennes par des traducteurs volontaires. Le site de DP Europe est\r\ndisponible en douze langues des le mois d'avril 2004. L'objectif a long\r\nterme est soixante langues, avec prise en compte de la plupart des\r\nlangues europeennes.\r\n\r\nCent livres numerises et corriges sont disponibles en mai 2005. Les\r\nlivres sont en plusieurs langues pour refleter la diversite\r\nlinguistique prevalant en Europe. 600 livres sont prets en fevrier 2009\r\net 732 livres le 15 octobre 2010.\r\n\r\nDP Europe utilise l'Unicode pour pouvoir traiter des livres dans un\r\ngrand nombre de langues. L'Unicode, cree en 1991, est un systeme\r\nd'encodage qui attribue un code unique a chaque caractere pour toutes\r\nles langues de la planete, et qui remplace peu a peu l'ASCII, un\r\nsysteme d'encodage datant de 1968 et qui ne peut traiter que l'anglais\r\net le latin dans sa version \"originale\", et quelques langues\r\neuropeennes avec accents dans sa version \"etendue\". En 2008, la moitie\r\ndes fichiers disponibles sur l'internet sont encodes en Unicode.\r\n\r\n# Distributed Proofreaders Canada\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Canada (DPC) debute ses activites en decembre\r\n2007 pour la production des livres du Projet Gutenberg Canada (PGC),\r\nqui voit lui-meme le jour quelques mois auparavant, le 1er juillet\r\n2007, le jour de la fete nationale, sous l'egide de Michael Shepard et\r\nDavid Jones. Les cent premiers livres sont disponibles en mars 2008,\r\navec des livres en anglais, en francais et en italien. 250 livres sont\r\ndisponibles en fevrier 2009 et 427 livres le 15 octobre 2010.\r\n\r\n# Quelques chiffres\r\n\r\n= Plus de 33.000 ebooks pour le Projet Gutenberg, tous relus et\r\ncorriges deux fois, et dans plusieurs langues, le but etant plus la\r\nqualite que la quantite.\r\n\r\n= 18.961 ebooks traites par Distributed Proofreaders (le site original,\r\nbase aux Etats-Unis) le 1er novembre 2010, depuis son lancement en\r\noctobre 2000, et 2.352 volontaires actifs pendant le mois d'octobre\r\n2010.\r\n\r\n= 739 ebooks traites par Distributed Proofreaders Europe le 1er\r\nnovembre 2010, depuis son lancement en janvier 2004.\r\n\r\n= 433 ebooks traites par Distributed Proofreaders Canada le 1er\r\nnovembre 2010, depuis son lancement en decembre 2007, avec 127\r\nvolontaires actifs pendant le mois d'octobre 2010.\r\n\r\n# Quelques liens\r\n\r\nLe Projet Gutenberg,\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders,\r\nhttp://www.pgdp.net/c/\r\nlance en octobre 2000.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Europe,\r\nhttp://dp.rastko.net/\r\nl'antenne europeenne lancee debut 2004, avec une interface en plusieurs\r\nlangues, dont le francais.\r\n\r\nDistributed Proofreaders Canada,\r\nhttp://www.pgdpcanada.net/c/default.php\r\nlance en decembre 2007.\r\n\r\nLes volontaires de tous pays sont en fait bienvenus sur les trois sites\r\n- sans preference geographique ni linguistique - la belle litterature\r\nn'ayant pas de frontieres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS / AGRADECIMIENTOS / REMERCIEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks to / Muchas gracias a / Merci a:\r\n\r\nAnna Alvarez\r\nMike Cook\r\nAl Haines\r\nMichael Hart\r\nGreg Newby\r\nRusson Wooldridge\r\n\r\nfor their kind help / para su ayuda / pour leur aide.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2010 Marie Lebert\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's 40 years / 40 anos / 40 ans, by Marie Lebert",
