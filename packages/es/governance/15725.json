The editor has found by actual experience that it\r\nis safe to undertake the story in three or four months from the time\r\nwhen the study of the language is begun, that is, in the second half of\r\nthe first year's work in the subject. As the book is not a long one, it\r\nshould be possible to read it entire before the close of the year.\r\nIndeed, with an earnest class, even less time than this will be found to\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\nThe novel is printed exactly (save correction of printer's errors) as it\r\nappears in the eighth Spanish edition (Madrid, 1896). At the same time,\r\ngreat pains have been taken to make the orthography and accentuation\r\nconform in all respects to the standard of the last edition of the\r\nSpanish Academy's Dictionary. The Notes are considerably fuller than is\r\ncustomary in college editions of modern works in foreign languages. This\r\nhas been made necessary in part by the dreadful insufficiency of the\r\nexisting Spanish-English dictionaries, and in part by the editor's\r\ndesire to afford the student some aid in dealing with grammatical\r\npeculiarities not fully discussed in the more available text-books. As a\r\nfurther help to grammatical study, numerous references have been\r\ninserted to Ramsey's _Text-Book of Modern Spanish_ (New York, 1894) and\r\nto Knapp's _Grammar of the Modern Spanish Language_ (Boston, 1891).\r\n\r\nA.R.M.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS March, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the new impression of this book the accentuation has been conformed\r\nto the new (fourteenth) edition of the Academy's Dictionary, a small\r\nnumber of misprints have been corrected, and a vocabulary has been\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nAs is stated in the above preface, a considerable part of the notes in\r\nthe first impression were intended as a partial substitute for a\r\nvocabulary. Obviously, the insertion of the vocabulary made such notes\r\nmainly superfluous; hence in the present edition such notes as seemed to\r\nbe mere duplication of the vocabulary are omitted. At the same time it\r\nwas inevitable that in the work of compiling the vocabulary some\r\nadditional occasions for making notes were found, and new light was\r\nobtained on some places where notes already stood. The result is that\r\nthe notes in the present impression, though shorter than before, contain\r\n(apart from vocabulary matter) more information, and it is hoped that\r\nthey will at least maintain the reputation which this edition of _Doña\r\nPerfecta_ has gained.\r\n\r\nBesides the references to the grammars of Ramsey and Knapp, references\r\nto Coester's _Spanish Grammar_ (Boston, 1912) are now given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two literary _genres_ in which Spaniards have most excelled are the\r\ndrama and the novel. Indeed, outside of these two forms, it may be said\r\nthat no Spaniard has won a literary success of the first order. Thus, in\r\nthe past six centuries there have been many Spanish poets of real worth;\r\nand yet in the list of the world's supreme poets no Spanish name\r\nappears. Among the world's great philosophers Spain has no\r\nrepresentative, though she has had thinkers of genuine power. She has\r\nhad no moralist, or historian, or political writer, or scientist of the\r\nhighest rank. Even religion, which at first sight would seem to be the\r\npredominant interest of Spain, has not there inspired any work of\r\nuniversal and permanent appeal to the race. The other nations of the\r\ncivilized world have at no time derived from Spain a powerful literary\r\nimpulse in any of these directions. Palestine and Greece and Rome and\r\nItaly and France and Germany and England have all had something\r\nlastingly valuable to say upon one or more of these matters; but no one\r\nwould think of turning to Spanish books for the best that has been\r\nthought and said upon any of them.\r\n\r\nWith the drama and the novel, however, the case is very different. Here\r\nSpain has had writers universally placed among the great artists of the\r\nworld. Calderón and Lope de Vega, with the crowd of lesser dramatists of\r\nthe end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century (the\r\nperiod Spaniards call their _siglo de oro_), produced a body of dramatic\r\nliterature, which for extent, variety, poetic force, and original\r\nnational feeling and conception can be compared only with the Greek and\r\nthe English drama. Of their own motion these poets learned all the\r\nessential secrets of the dramatic art. They acquired the faculty of\r\ntelling upon the stage any story they chose in such a way that it should\r\nseem a picture of life itself to their audience; and, at the same time,\r\nthey managed to fuse with their tales all their accumulated reflection\r\nupon men and things, all the various play of fancy, all the fine gold of\r\nthe imagination, and all the humor, gay or grotesque, which the plain\r\nprose of life itself does not contain. Working freely, unawed by classic\r\nmodels whose perfection they would attain, they were easy in their\r\nmotions, frank of conception, and ready to follow their matter wherever\r\nit might lead them. They had no dread of being dull or unpoetical or\r\nundignified; the best of them were constantly all these. But for this\r\nvery reason they were large and free and powerful, scornful of trivial\r\ndifficulties and obstacles, and able to attain success where all the\r\nchances were against them. The thought and feeling, the hopes and\r\naspirations, the delusions and absurdities of Spain in the period of her\r\ngreatest power and splendor are all mirrored in their verse. Like the\r\nElizabethan dramatists, furthermore, they exacted tribute from all other\r\nliteratures and spent it as they would. And though their work has seldom\r\nthe rare distinction of ultimate perfection of form (indeed, in this\r\nrespect falls below the best Elizabethan standard), no one can read it\r\nwithout perceiving that he is engaged with the rich and vital utterance\r\nof artists who are masters of their craft.\r\n\r\nHardly less remarkable than the Spanish drama is the Spanish novel.\r\nObviously, much the same qualities are demanded for success in the one\r\nform as in the other; and from the earliest period Spanish story-tellers\r\nhave known how to do their work well. There are tales in the\r\nfourteenth-century collection by Don Juan Manuel, known as _El Conde\r\nLucanor_, that are as skillfully contrived as could possibly be. In\r\nspite of its prolixity, the once famous romance of _Amadis of Gaul_,\r\nwhich was given its Spanish form in the end of the fifteenth century,\r\nmust still be regarded as a highly successful piece of narration. At the\r\nclose of the same century, the often indecent, but never dull\r\n'tragi-comedy' of _Celestina_ (a novel in fact, though dramatic in form)\r\nproved its excellence as a piece of literary workmanship by attaining\r\nspeedily a European reputation. The sixteenth century saw the evolution\r\nof so-called _novela picaresca_, or rogue novel, one of the most\r\nimportant and influential of modern literary forms. And, finally, in\r\n1605 Cervantes published the first part of one of the greatest of modern\r\nbooks, _Don Quixote_,--a novel in which the art of story-telling is\r\nbrought to almost unrivaled perfection.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times, the Spanish novel has, of course, suffered from\r\nthe general intellectual decline of Spain as a whole. Its originality\r\nhas been impaired by the inevitable and generally baneful influence\r\nexercised by foreign models upon the taste of a people not confident in\r\nits own strength and superiority. The eighteenth century, in particular,\r\nproduced little deserving even casual mention. Yet in no period have\r\nevidences of the old power been entirely lacking; and as soon as the\r\nintellectual, no less than political, agitations that attended the\r\nopening of the present century began, these evidences at once became\r\nmore numerous and more significant. The task of acquiring modernity has,\r\nto be sure, proved longer and more difficult in Spain than in any other\r\ngreat European nation, and the earlier literary work of the century has\r\nabout it too much of the general spiritual and artistic uncertainty of\r\nsuch a period of confusion and change to possess enduring excellence.\r\nBut the trained observer can detect even in the unequal and hesitating\r\nessays of the first half of our century indications of a renewal of the\r\nold skill and of the gradual evolution of a new type of novel, which,\r\nwhile modern in its methods and materials, still allies itself with what\r\nis best in the older tradition.\r\n\r\nThe fruition of this period of growth has been seen since the middle of\r\nthe century, and to-day Spanish novelists easily hold their own with the\r\nbest of the world. Indeed, in the opinion of many well qualified to\r\njudge, there is in no language at the present time a body of fiction\r\nmore original, more various, more genuinely interesting than Spanish\r\nauthors have produced. Juan Valera, Pedro Alarcón, José María Pereda,\r\nArmando Palacio Valdés, the Padre Luís Coloma, Doña Emilia Pardo Bazán,\r\nand, last, the author of the present volume, Benito Pérez Galdós, have\r\nsucceeded along very different lines, and with striking independence of\r\nmanner, in composing a mass of fiction which depicts the real Spain of\r\nto-day perhaps more adequately than the novelists of any other country\r\nhave been able to render their native land. The reader of Valera is\r\nfilled with perpetual admiration of his fine cosmopolitan scepticism,\r\ncombined with rich traditional culture of the true Spanish type,\r\nrendered in a subtle, gay, delightful style that derives from the purest\r\nsources of sixteenth-century Spanish. In Alarcón Spanish irony and\r\nSpanish rhetoric (_l'emphase espagnole_, as the French call it) combine\r\nin rarely personal admixture. Pereda studies the crude and homely life\r\nof the region of Santander with the care for detail of the most\r\nscrupulous realist, but without the hard and brutal curiosity about the\r\nmerely external that realism adopted as a literary creed seems to bring\r\nwith it. Valdés and Coloma and Señora Bazán, writing from very different\r\npoints of view, all reproduce for us with sure touches the sentiments\r\nand ideals, the virtues and vices of Spanish society, high and low,\r\nurban or rural, of to-day. And Pérez Galdós, the most fruitful of them\r\nall, has embraced the entire century in his work, and affords us, on the\r\nwhole, the clearest and fullest account of the recent spiritual and\r\nsocial life of his nation anywhere to be found.\r\n\r\nBenito Pérez Galdós was born at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, May\r\n10, 1845. The details of his early life are entirely unknown except to\r\nhimself, his invincible modesty denying them even to personal friends\r\nlike the writer of the only biography of him (a meagre one) that has\r\nappeared, Leopoldo Alas. He studied in the local Instituto, and must\r\nhave profited by his opportunities, for the literary attainments shown\r\nin his novels can have resulted only from persistent labor from youth\r\nup. In 1863 he went to Madrid to study law in the University, but with\r\nlittle eagerness for his future profession. He already dreamed of a\r\nliterary career, and tried the hand of an apprentice at journalism and\r\nat pieces for the theatre, none of which, happily, as he has since said,\r\nwas represented. In 1867, his mind being engaged at once by the\r\nrevolutionary agitation of his own time, and by the similar interest of\r\nthe still more violent upheaval in Spain in the first years of the\r\ncentury, he began a kind of historical novel, _La Fontana de Oro_, in\r\nwhich he undertook to study the inner motives and history of that\r\nperiod, so all-important for modern Spanish history, and to illustrate\r\nthe detestable character of Ferdinand VII as it appeared in one of his\r\nmost disgraceful moments. It was four years, however, before the book\r\nwas completed and published. During this time Galdós had visited France\r\nand had returned to Madrid by way of Barcelona, where he was when the\r\nRevolution of 1868, which deprived Queen Isabel of her throne, broke\r\nout. This he greeted with delight, believing the realization of his\r\nconservatively radical political views to be at hand; but he speedily\r\nfound himself sadly disillusioned. In 1871 his novel appeared, making no\r\nsensation, but attracting the favorable attention of a few competent\r\njudges. The road was at last opened before him, and he pressed steadily\r\non in it.\r\n\r\nHis imagination had now become deeply stirred by both the political and\r\nthe social aspects of the great period of the awakening of Spain, when,\r\nto begin with, she freed herself by heroic efforts from the Napoleonic\r\ntyranny, and then made her incipient advances towards modernity in the\r\nface of the opposition of the representatives of her traditional\r\nreligion and of her outworn social order. In 1872 he had completed a\r\nsecond novel, _El Audaz_, in which a phase of the struggle earlier than\r\nthat studied in _La Fontana de Oro_, was his theme. Then, taking a\r\nsuggestion perhaps from the success of the historical novels of\r\nErckmann-Chatrian, he began a succession of consecutive tales,\r\n_Episodios Nacionales_, as he called them, which, in two series, cover\r\nthe whole agitated time from the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 down to the\r\ndeath of Ferdinand VII in 1833. Each series has its hero, whose fortunes\r\nafford a slender thread binding the tales together, and whose\r\nparticipation in the successive events or crises of the War of\r\nIndependence and of the reign of Ferdinand VII enables the author to\r\ngive these events their proper setting in the political and social\r\nmovements of the period. Naturally, there is great inequality in the\r\nexecution of so long a list of tales (twenty in all), and the reader's\r\nattention at times flags. Yet the care with which Galdós studied his\r\nmaterial, acquainting himself with the minutest details of the history\r\nof the time, and the skill as a narrator that rarely fails him, make the\r\n_Episodios Nacionales_ incomparably the best documents in which to\r\nobtain a true understanding of one of the greatest movements in the life\r\nof a great and interesting nation.\r\n\r\nBefore he had concluded the _Episodios Nacionales_, however, Galdós had\r\nbegun to feel the attraction of an even deeper and more significant\r\nmovement,--that of the modernization of the Spain of the present day.\r\nHere, to be sure, the situations are less famous and picturesque, the\r\npart of action is diminished, and patriotic emotion is less evoked; but\r\nthe struggle to be studied is none the less violent and profound. For\r\nreaders of our time this struggle perhaps gains in interest from being\r\nrather inward than outward, and from demanding of him who paints it\r\nrather a study of souls than the delineation of stirring events. In few\r\ncountries has the clash between the new and the old been so violent, or\r\nthe adjustment to the new produced so many and so startling\r\nincongruities as in Spain. The deadly antagonism of the traditional\r\nreligious and social feeling of the race towards the whole modern manner\r\nof thinking, the ruinous effects of a first taste of modern luxury upon\r\nthose who come ignorantly and blindly under its spell, the agitations of\r\nminds whose moral continuity has been broken by ill-understood freedom\r\nof speculation, the disasters produced by political or social ambitions\r\naroused in those grotesquely unfit for their attainment,--in short, the\r\nillusions, the vain hopes, the failures, the despairs, the hates, the\r\nwoe which every great movement of the _Zeitgeist_ inevitably causes in\r\nevery nation, these are the themes which Galdós has of late found\r\nirresistibly attractive, and to which he has devoted much the richest\r\nand strongest part of his work.\r\n\r\nThe first novel in which the new interest was predominant was the\r\npresent book, _Doña Perfecta_, finished in April, 1876. In it Galdós\r\nbrought the new and the old face to face: the new in the form of a\r\nhighly trained, clear-thinking, frank-speaking modern man; the old in\r\nthe guise of a whole community so remote from the current of things that\r\nits religious intolerance, its social jealousy, its undisturbed\r\nconfidence and pride in itself must of necessity declare instant war\r\nupon that which comes from without, unsympathetic and critical. The\r\ninevitable result is ruin for the party whose physical force is less,\r\nthe single individual, yet hardly less complete ruin for those whom\r\nintolerance and hate have driven to the annihilation of their adversary.\r\nThe sympathies of the author, as his closing sentence shows, are with\r\nthe new, but his conscience as artist has none the less compelled him to\r\ngive to the old its right of full and fair utterance.\r\n\r\nThe same ignorant or stubborn religiosity, negative for good, working\r\nevil for all affected by it, has been studied by Galdós in two\r\nsubsequent novels, _La Familia de León Roch_ and _Gloria_, which are\r\ngenerally reputed to be, with _Doña Perfecta_, the greatest of his\r\nworks. _Gloria_, in particular, has received great and deserved\r\nlaudation, in spite of some looseness and unevenness of the technique\r\ndue to the rapidity with which it was written (the first part in hardly\r\nmore than a fortnight, the author tells us). The theme is not unlike\r\nthat of George Eliot's _Daniel Deronda_, one of the protagonists being\r\nan English Jew, with the profoundest attachment to the traditions of his\r\nrace, the other a Spanish girl, in whom the faith of her fathers is an\r\nineradicable instinct. Few finer and more tragic situations have been\r\nimagined by moderns than this. No less tragic, though less poetic, is\r\nthe ruin of León Roch, weighed down by the burden of an insanely bigoted\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nOther groups of novels deal with the other aspects of the modern society\r\nof Spain of which mention has been made. In one group we have the\r\ndisasters caused in lowly homes by the vanity of women who have caught a\r\nglimpse of the pleasures of the rich, and pitilessly demand them. The\r\npoor official, out of a place, in _Miau_, is goaded to suicide by the\r\nexactions of his wife and daughter and sister-in-law. In _La de Bringas_\r\nwe have the squalid intrigues of a family on the edge of 'high life' and\r\nstriving to get within it. _El Amigo Manso_ loves, and is exploited for\r\nher social advantage by the woman whom he loves. A second group of tales\r\ndeals with the hard question how the woman, left to her own resources\r\nand without income, shall find her support. Here belong _Fortunata y\r\nJacinta, La Desheredada, Tristana_, and _Tormento_. It is the pathos of\r\nthis problem, not its unseemly and revolting details, that impresses\r\nGaldós and that he strives to convey. And finally, there should be\r\nmentioned those stories in which Galdós shows us the beauty and\r\nuplifting power of natural sentiment, as _Marianela_; or the positive\r\nand beneficent results that may come from a certain pure and unbigoted,\r\nthough somewhat mystical, religious feeling, as _Angel Guerra, Nazarín,_\r\nand _Halma_.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the above hasty survey of Galdós' work that there runs\r\nthrough it all a profound moral sentiment, a sense of the tragedy of\r\nmodern life, an impatience of the irremediable and hopeless\r\ncontradictions in which ignorance and intolerance involve us. At the\r\nsame time, it should not be supposed that the general impression\r\nproduced by his novels is gloomy and forbidding. On the contrary, few\r\nmodern writers show so constantly the play of a free and wholesome\r\nhumor, or in more manly fashion take life as it comes, without tears or\r\nwhining. He does not strive nor cry; nor does he moralize. He shows us\r\nlife as it appears to him in a critical period of his nation's history,\r\nunfolding it before us in its incessant variety, and not debauching us\r\nby lessons of unmanly pessimism any more than by alluring optimism. And\r\nto give to his work its final and irresistible claim upon us, he is the\r\nmaster of a singularly rich and virile style--a style not modeled upon a\r\nfad, but expressive of the whole nature of the man; capable of\r\neloquence, of wit and humor, of anger and scorn; now simple and\r\nunadorned, now laden with a burden of reflection and of the great\r\ntraditional memories, literary and other, of the race. The Spanish\r\npurists have indeed declared this style to be far from impeccable, and\r\nthis is altogether probable. But none the less it has something much\r\nmore important than impeccability; it has life and strength, and, when\r\nits master pleases, beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                     1\r\n\r\n                              DOÑA PERFECTA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    I\r\n\r\n                  =Villahorrenda!... cinco minutos!...=\r\n\r\n     Cuando el tren mixto descendente número 65 (no es\r\n     preciso nombrar la línea), se detuvo en la pequeña estación\r\n     situada entre los kilómetros 171 y 172, casi todos los viajeros\r\n     de segunda y tercera clase se quedaron durmiendo o bostezando\r\n[5]  dentro de los coches, porque el frío penetrante de la\r\n     madrugada no convidadas a pasear por el desamparado\r\n     andén. El único viajero de primera que en el tren venía\r\n     bajó apresuradamente, y dirigiéndose a los empleados, preguntóles\r\n     si aquél era el apeadero de Villahorrenda. (Este\r\n[10] nombre, como otros muchos que después se verán, es\r\n     propiedad del autor.)\r\n\r\n     --En Villahorrenda estamos--repuso el conductor, cuya\r\n     voz se confundió con el cacarear de las gallinas que en\r\n     aquel momento eran subidas al furgón.--Se me había olvidado\r\n[15] llamarle a usted, Sr. de Rey. Creo que ahí le esperan\r\n     a usted con las caballerías.\r\n\r\n     --¡Pero hace aquí un frío de tres mil demonios!--dijo el\r\n     viajero envolviéndose en su manta.--¿No hay en el apeadero\r\n     algún sitio donde descansar y reponerse antes de\r\n[20] emprender un viaje a caballo por este país de hielo?\r\n\r\n     No había concluído de hablar, cuando el conductor,\r\n     llamado por las apremiantes obligaciones de su oficio,\r\n     marchóse, dejando a nuestro desconocido caballero con la        2\r\n     palabra en la boca. Vió éste que se acercaba otro empleado\r\n     con un farol pendiente de la derecha mano, el cual movíase\r\n     al compás de la marcha, proyectando geométricas series de\r\n[5]  ondulaciones luminosas. La luz caía sobre el piso del\r\n     andén, formando un _zig zag_ semejante al que describe la\r\n     lluvia de una regadera.\r\n\r\n     --¿Hay fonda o dormitorio en la estación de Villahorrenda?\r\n     preguntó el viajero al del farol.\r\n\r\n[10] --Aquí no hay nada--respondió éste secamente, corriendo\r\n     hacia los que cargaban y echándoles tal rociada de\r\n     votos, juramentos, blasfemias y atroces invocaciones, que\r\n     hasta las gallinas, escandalizadas de tan grosera brutalidad,\r\n     murmuraron dentro de sus cestas.\r\n\r\n     --Lo mejor será salir de aquí a toda prisa--dijo el\r\n[15] caballero para su capote.--El conductor me anunció que\r\n     ahí estaban las caballerías.\r\n\r\n     Esto pensaba, cuando sintió que una sutil y respetuosa\r\n     mano le tiraba suavemente del abrigo. Volvióse y vió una\r\n     obscura masa de paño pardo sobre sí misma revuelta y por\r\n[20] cuyo principal pliegue asomaba el avellanado rostro astuto\r\n     de un labriego castellano. Fijóse en la desgarbada estatura\r\n     que recordaba al chopo entre los vegetales; vió los sagaces\r\n     ojos que bajo el ala de ancho sombrero de terciopelo viejo\r\n     resplandecían; vió la mano morena y acerada que empuñaba\r\n[25] una vara verde y el ancho pie que, al moverse, hacía sonajear\r\n     el hierro de la espuela.\r\n\r\n     --¿Es usted el Sr. D. José de Rey?--preguntó, echando\r\n     mano al sombrero.\r\n\r\n     --Sí; y usted--repuso el caballero con alegría--será\r\n[30] el criado de doña Perfecta, que viene a buscarme a este\r\n     apeadero para conducirme a Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     --El mismo. Cuando usted guste marchar... La jaca\r\n     corre como el viento. Me parece que el Sr. D. José ha de ser\r\n     buen ginete. Verdad es que a quien de casta le viene...\r\n\r\n     --¿Por dónde se sale?--dijo el viajero con impaciencia.   3\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, vámonos de aquí, señor... ¿Cómo se llama\r\n     usted?\r\n\r\n     --Me llamo Pedro Lucas--respondió el del paño pardo,\r\n[5]  repitiendo la intención de quitarse el sombrero; pero me\r\n     llaman el tío Licurgo. ¿En dónde está el equipaje del\r\n     señorito?\r\n\r\n     --Allí bajo el reloj lo veo. Son tres bultos. Dos maletas\r\n     y un mundo de libros para el Sr. D. Cayetano. Tome\r\n[10] usted el talón.\r\n\r\n     Un momento después señor y escudero hallábanse a\r\n     espaldas de la barraca llamada estación, frente a un caminejo\r\n     que partiendo de allí se perdía en las vecinas lomas\r\n     desnudas, donde confusamente se distinguía el miserable\r\n[15] caserío de Villahorrenda. Tres caballerías debían transportar\r\n     todo, hombres y mundos. Una jaca de no mala\r\n     estampa era destinada al caballero. El tío Licurgo oprimiría\r\n     los lomos de un cuartago venerable, algo desvencijado,\r\n     aunque seguro; y el macho, cuyo freno debía regir\r\n[20] un joven zagal de piernas listas y fogosa sangre, cargaría\r\n     el equipaje.\r\n\r\n     Antes de que la caravana se pusiese en movimiento,\r\n     partió el tren, que se iba escurriendo por la vía con la\r\n     parsimoniosa cachaza de un tren mixto. Sus pasos, retumbando\r\n[25] cada vez más lejanos, producían ecos profundos bajo\r\n     tierra. Al entrar en el túnel del kilómetro 172, lanzó el\r\n     vapor por el silbato y un aullido estrepitoso resonó en los\r\n     aires. El túnel, echando por su negra boca un hálito\r\n     blanquecino, clamoreaba como una trompeta, y al oír su\r\n[30] enorme voz, despertaban aldeas, villas, ciudades, provincias.\r\n     Aquí cantaba un gallo, más allá otro. Principiaba\r\n     a amanecer.\r\n\r\n                                                                      4\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 II\r\n\r\n                =Un viaje por el corazón de España=\r\n\r\n     Cuando empezada la caminata dejaron a un lado las\r\n     casuchas de Villahorrenda, el caballero, que era joven y de\r\n     muy buen ver, habló de este modo:\r\n\r\n     --Dígame usted, Sr. Solón...\r\n\r\n[5]  --Licurgo, para servir a usted...\r\n\r\n     --Eso es, Sr. Licurgo. Bien decía yo que era usted un\r\n     sabio legislador de la antigüedad. Perdone usted la equivocación.\r\n     Pero vamos al caso. Dígame usted, ¿cómo\r\n     está mi señora tía?\r\n\r\n[10] --Siempre tan guapa--repuso el labriego, adelantando\r\n     algunos pasos su caballería.--Parece que no pasan años\r\n     por la señora doña Perfecta. Bien dicen que al bueno\r\n     Dios le da larga vida. Así viviera mil años ese ángel del\r\n     Señor. Si las bendiciones que le echan en la tierra fueran\r\n[15] plumas, la señora no necesitaría más alas para subir al cielo.\r\n\r\n     --¿Y mi prima la señorita Rosario?\r\n\r\n     --¡Bien haya quien a los suyos parece!--dijo el aldeano.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué he de decirle de doña Rosarito, sino que es el vivo\r\n     retrato de su madre? Buena prenda se lleva usted, caballero\r\n[20] D. José, si es verdad, como dicen, que ha venido para\r\n     casarse con ella. Tal para cual, y la niña no tiene tampoco\r\n     por qué quejarse. Poco va de Pedro a Pedro.\r\n\r\n     --¿Y el Sr. D. Cayetano?\r\n\r\n     --Siempre metidillo en la faena de sus libros. Tiene\r\n[25] una biblioteca más grande que la catedral, y también escarba\r\n     la tierra para buscar piedras llenas de unos demonches de\r\n     garabatos que dicen escribieron los moros.\r\n\r\n     --¿En cuánto tiempo llegaremos a Orbajosa?\r\n\r\n     --A las nueve, si Dios quiere. Poco contenta se va a\r\n[30] poner la señora cuando vea a su sobrino.... Y la señorita        5\r\n     Rosarito que estaba ayer disponiendo el cuarto en que usted\r\n     ha de vivir.... Como no le han visto nunca, la madre y la\r\n     hija están que no viven, pensando en cómo será o cómo no\r\n     será este Sr. D. José. Ya llegó el tiempo de que callen\r\n[5]  cartas y hablen barbas. La prima verá al primo y todo\r\n     será fiesta y gloria. Amanecerá Dios y medraremos, como\r\n     dijo el otro.\r\n\r\n     --Como mi tía y mi prima no me conocen todavía--dijo\r\n     sonriendo el caballero,--no es prudente hacer proyectos.\r\n\r\n[10] --Verdad es; por eso se dijo que uno piensa el bayo y\r\n     otro el que lo ensilla--repuso el labriego.--Pero la cara\r\n     no engaña... ¡qué alhaja se lleva usted! ¡Y qué buen\r\n     mozo ella!\r\n\r\n     El caballero no oyó las últimas palabras del tío Licurgo,\r\n[15] porque iba distraído y algo meditabundo. Llegaban a un\r\n     recodo del camino, cuando el labriego, torciendo la dirección\r\n     a las caballerías, dijo:\r\n\r\n     --Ahora tenemos que echar por esta vereda. El puente\r\n     está roto y no se puede vadear el río sino por el cerrillo de\r\n[20] los Lirios.\r\n\r\n     --¿El cerrillo de los Lirios?--dijo el caballero, saliendo\r\n     de su meditación.--¡Cómo abundan los nombres poéticos\r\n     en estos sitios tan feos! Desde que viajo por estas tierras,\r\n     me sorprende la horrible ironía de los nombres. Tal sitio\r\n[25] que se distingue por su yermo aspecto y la desolada tristeza\r\n     del negro paisaje, se llama _Valleameno_. Tal villorrio de\r\n     adobes que miserablemente se extiende sobre un llano árido\r\n     y que de diversos modos pregona su pobreza, tiene la insolencia\r\n     de nombrarse _Villarica_; y hay un barranco pedregoso\r\n[30] y polvoriento, donde ni los cardos encuentran jugo, y\r\n     que sin embargo se llama _Valdeflores_. ¿Eso que tenemos\r\n     delante es el _Cerrillo de los Lirios_? ¿Pero dónde están esos\r\n     lirios, hombre de Dios? Yo no veo más que piedras y\r\n     yerba descolorida. Llamen a eso el _Cerrillo de la Desolación_\r\n     y hablarán a derechas. Exceptuando _Villahorrenda_, que          6\r\n     parece ha recibido al mismo tiempo el nombre y la hechura,\r\n     todo aquí es ironía. Palabras hermosas, realidad prosaica\r\n     y miserable. Los ciegos serían felices en este país, que\r\n[5]  para la lengua es paraíso y para los ojos infierno.\r\n\r\n     El Sr. Licurgo o no entendió las palabras del caballero\r\n     Rey o no hizo caso de ellas. Cuando vadearon el río, que\r\n     turbio y revuelto corría con impaciente precipitación, como\r\n     si huyera de sus propias orillas, el labriego extendió el brazo\r\n[10] hacia unas tierras que a la siniestra mano en grande y desnuda\r\n     extensión se veían, y dijo:\r\n\r\n     --Estos son los _Alamillos de Bustamente_.\r\n\r\n     --¡Mis tierras!--exclamó con júbilo el caballero, tendiendo\r\n     la vista por los tristes campos que alumbraban las\r\n[15] primeras luces de la mañana.--Es la primera vez que veo\r\n     el patrimonio que heredé de mi madre. La pobre hacía\r\n     tales ponderaciones de este país y me contaba tantas maravillas\r\n     de él, que yo, siendo niño, creía que estar aquí era\r\n     estar en la gloria. Frutas, flores, caza mayor y menor,\r\n[20] montes, lagos, ríos, poéticos arroyos, oteros pastoriles, todo\r\n     lo había en los _Alamillos de Bustamente_, en esta tierra bendita,\r\n     la mejor y más hermosa de todas las tierras....\r\n     ¡Qué demonio! La gente de este país vive con la imaginación.\r\n     Si en mi niñez, y cuando vivía con las ideas y con\r\n[25] el entusiasmo de mi buena madre, me hubieran traído aquí,\r\n     también me habrían parecido encantadores estos desnudos\r\n     cerros, estos llanos polvorientos o encharcados, estas vetustas\r\n     casas de labor, estas norias desvencijadas, cuyos cangilones\r\n     lagrimean lo bastante para regar media docena de\r\n[30] coles, esta desolación miserable y perezosa que estoy mirando.\r\n\r\n     --Es la mejor tierra del país--dijo el señor Licurgo--y\r\n     para el garbanzo es de lo que no hay.\r\n\r\n     --Pues lo celebro, porque desde que las heredé no me\r\n     han producido un cuarto estas célebres tierras.\r\n\r\n     El sabio legislador espartano se rascó la oreja y dió un         7\r\n     suspiro.\r\n\r\n     --Pero me han dicho--continuó el caballero--que algunos\r\n     propietarios colindantes han metido su arado en estos\r\n[5]  grandes estados míos, y poco a poco me los van cercenando.\r\n     Aquí no hay mojones, ni linderos, ni verdadera propiedad,\r\n     Sr. Licurgo.\r\n\r\n     El labriego, después de una pausa, durante la cual parecía\r\n     ocupar su sutil espíritu en profundas disquisiciones, se expresó\r\n[10] de este modo:\r\n\r\n     --El tío Pasolargo, a quien llamamos el _Filósofo_ por su\r\n     mucha trastienda, metió el arado en los _Alamillos_ por encima\r\n     de la ermita, y roe que roe, se ha zampado seis fanegadas.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué incomparable escuela!--exclamó riendo el caballero.\r\n[15] --Apostaré que no ha sido ese el único... filósofo.\r\n\r\n     --Bien dijo el otro, que quien las sabe las tañe, y si al\r\n     palomar no le falta cebo no le faltarán palomas.... Pero\r\n     usted, Sr. D. José, puede decir aquello de que el ojo del\r\n     amo engorda la vaca, y ahora que está aquí ver de recobrar\r\n[20] su finca.\r\n\r\n     --Quizás no sea tan fácil, Sr. Licurgo--repuso el caballero,\r\n     a punto que entraban por una senda a cuyos lados se\r\n     veían hermosos trigos que con su lozanía y temprana madurez\r\n     recreaban la vista.--Este campo parece mejor cultivado.\r\n[25] Veo que no todo es tristeza y miseria en los _Alamillos_.\r\n\r\n     El labriego puso cara de lástima, y afectando cierto desdén\r\n     hacia los campos elogiados por el viajero, dijo en tono\r\n     humildísimo:\r\n\r\n     --Señor, esto es mío.\r\n\r\n[30] --Perdone usted--replicó vivamente el caballero--ya\r\n     quería yo meter mi hoz en los estados de usted. Por lo\r\n     visto, la filosofía aquí es contagiosa.\r\n\r\n     Bajaron inmediatamente a una cañada, que era lecho de\r\n     pobre y estancado arroyo, y pasado éste, entraron en un\r\n     campo lleno de piedras, sin la más ligera muestra de vegetación.\r\n                                                                  8\r\n     --Esta tierra es muy mala--dijo el caballero, volviendo\r\n     el rostro para mirar a su guía y compañero que se había\r\n[5]  quedado un poco atrás.--Difícilmente podrá usted sacar\r\n     partido de ella, porque todo es fango y arena.\r\n\r\n     Licurgo, lleno de mansedumbre, contestó:\r\n\r\n     --Esto... es de usted.\r\n\r\n     --Veo que aquí todo lo malo es mío--afirmó el caballero,\r\n[10] riendo jovialmente.\r\n\r\n     Cuando esto hablaban, tomaron de nuevo el camino real.\r\n     Ya la luz del día, entrando en alegre irrupción por todas\r\n     las ventanas y claraboyas del hispano horizonte, inundó de\r\n     esplendorosa claridad los campos.  El inmenso cielo sin\r\n[15] nubes parecía agrandarse más y alejarse de la tierra para\r\n     verla y en su contemplación recrearse desde más alto. La\r\n     desolada tierra sin árboles, pajiza a trechos, a trechos de\r\n     color gredoso, dividida toda en triángulos y cuadriláteros\r\n     amarillos o negruzcos, pardos o ligeramente verdegueados,\r\n[20] semejaba en cierto modo a la capa del harapiento que se pone\r\n     al sol. Sobre aquella capa miserable el cristianismo y el\r\n     islamismo habían trabado épicas batallas. Gloriosos campos,\r\n     sí, pero los combates de antaño les habían dejado horribles.\r\n\r\n     --Me parece que hoy picará el sol, Sr. Licurgo--dijo el\r\n[25] caballero, desembarazándose un poco del abrigo en que se\r\n     envolvía.--¡Qué triste camino! No se ve ni un solo árbol\r\n     en todo lo que alcanza la vista. Aquí todo es al revés. La\r\n     ironía no cesa. ¿Por qué, si no hay aquí álamos grandes\r\n     ni chicos, se ha de llamar esto los _Alamillos_?\r\n\r\n[30] El tío Licurgo no contestó a la pregunta, porque con toda\r\n     su alma atendía a ciertos lejanos ruidos que de improviso se\r\n     oyeron, y con ademán intranquilo detuvo su cabalgadura,\r\n     mientras exploraba el camino y los cerros lejanos con sombría\r\n     mirada.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué hay?--preguntó el viajero, deteniéndose también.          9\r\n\r\n     --¿Trae usted armas, D. José?\r\n\r\n     --Un revólver.... ¡Ah! ya comprendo. ¿Hay\r\n[5]  ladrones?\r\n\r\n     --Puede...--repuso el labriego con mucho recelo.--\r\n     Me parece que sonó un tiro.\r\n\r\n     --Allá lo veremos... ¡adelante!--dijo el caballero\r\n     picando su jaca.--No serán tan temibles.\r\n\r\n[10] --Calma, Sr. D. José--exclamó el aldeano deteniéndole.\r\n     --Esa gente es más mala que Satanás. El otro día asesinaron\r\n     a dos caballeros que iban a tomar el tren.... Dejémonos\r\n     de fiestas. Gasparón el Fuerte, Pepito Chispillas,\r\n     Merengue y Ahorca Suegras no me verán la cara en mis\r\n[15] días. Echemos por la vereda.\r\n\r\n     --Adelante, Sr. Licurgo.\r\n\r\n     --Atrás, Sr. D. José--replicó el labriego con afligido\r\n     acento.--Usted no sabe bien qué gente es esa. Ellos\r\n     fueron los que en el mes pasado robaron de la iglesia del\r\n[20] Carmen el copón, la corona de la Virgen y dos candeleros;\r\n     ellos fueron los que hace dos años robaron el tren que iba\r\n     para Madrid.\r\n\r\n     Don José, al oír tan lamentables antecedentes, sintió que\r\n     aflojaba un poco su intrepidez.\r\n\r\n[25] --¿Ve usted aquel cerro grande y empinado que hay allá\r\n     lejos? Pues allí se esconden esos pícaros en unas cuevas\r\n     que llaman la _Estancia de los Caballeros_.\r\n\r\n     --¡De los Caballeros!\r\n\r\n     --Sí señor. Bajan al camino real, cuando la Guardia\r\n[30] civil se descuida, y roban lo que pueden. ¿No ve usted\r\n     más allá de la vuelta del camino una cruz, que se puso en\r\n     memoria de la muerte que dieron al alcalde de Villahorrenda\r\n     cuando las elecciones?\r\n\r\n     --Sí, veo la cruz.\r\n\r\n     --Allí hay una casa vieja, en la cual se esconden para          10\r\n     aguardar a los tragineros. A aquel sitio llamamos las\r\n     _Delicias_.\r\n\r\n     --¡Las Delicias!...\r\n\r\n[5]  --Si todos los que han sido muertos y robados al\r\n     pasar por ahí resucitaran, podría formarse con ellos un\r\n     ejército.\r\n\r\n     Cuando esto decían, oyéronse más de cerca los tiros, lo\r\n     que turbó un poco el esforzado corazón de los viajantes,\r\n[10] pero no el del zagalillo que, retozando de alegría, pidió al\r\n     Sr. Licurgo licencia para adelantarse y ver la batalla que\r\n     tan cerca se había trabado. Observando la decisión del\r\n     muchacho, avergonzóse D. José de haber sentido miedo, o\r\n     cuando menos un poco de respeto a los ladrones, y exclamó,\r\n[15] espoleando la jaca:\r\n\r\n     --Pues allá iremos todos. Quizás podamos prestar auxilio\r\n     a los infelices viajeros que en tan gran aprieto se ven, y\r\n     poner las peras a cuarto a los _caballeros_.\r\n\r\n     Esforzábase el labriego en convencer al joven de la temeridad\r\n[20] de sus propósitos, así como de lo inútil de su generosa\r\n     idea, porque los robados robados estaban y quizás muertos,\r\n     y en situación de no necesitar auxilio de nadie. Insistía el\r\n     señor a pesar de estas sesudas advertencias, contestaba el\r\n     aldeano, poniendo la más viva resistencia, cuando la presencia\r\n[25] de dos o tres carromateros que por el camino abajo tranquilamente\r\n     venían conduciendo una galera, puso fin a la\r\n     cuestión. No debía de ser grande el peligro, cuando tan\r\n     sin cuidado venían aquéllos, cantando alegres coplas; y así\r\n     fué en efecto, porque los tiros, según dijeron, no eran disparados\r\n[30] por los ladrones, sino por la Guardia civil, que de\r\n     este modo quería cortar el vuelo a media docena de cacos\r\n     que ensartados conducía a la cárcel de la villa.\r\n\r\n     --Ya, ya sé lo que ha sido--dijo Licurgo, señalando\r\n     leve humareda que a mano derecha del camino y a regular\r\n     distancia se descubría.--Allí les han escabechado. Esto         11\r\n     pasa un día sí y otro no.\r\n\r\n     El caballero no comprendía.\r\n\r\n     --Yo le aseguro al Sr. D. José--añadió con energía el\r\n[5]  legislador lacedemonio,--que está muy retebién hecho;\r\n     porque de nada sirve formar causa a esos pillos. El juez\r\n     les marea un poco y después les suelta. Si al cabo de seis\r\n     años de causa, alguno va a presidio, a lo mejor se escapa,\r\n     o le indultan y vuelve a la Estancia de los Caballeros. Lo\r\n[10] mejor es esto: ¡fuego en ellos! Se les lleva a la cárcel,\r\n     y cuando se pasa por un lugar a propósito... \"¡ah!\r\n     perro, que te quieres escapar... pum, pum\".... Ya\r\n     está hecha la sumaria, requeridos los testigos, celebrada la\r\n     vista, dada la sentencia.... Todo en un minuto. Bien\r\n[15] dicen, que si mucho sabe la zorra, más sabe el que la toma.\r\n\r\n     --Pues adelante, y apretemos el paso, que este camino,\r\n     a más de largo, no tiene nada de ameno--dijo Rey.\r\n\r\n     Al pasar junto a las Delicias, vieron, a poca distancia del\r\n     camino, a los guardias que minutos antes habían ejecutado\r\n[20] la extraña sentencia que el lector sabe. Mucha pena causó\r\n     al zagalillo que no le permitieran ir a contemplar de cerca\r\n     los palpitantes cadáveres de los ladrones, que en horroroso\r\n     grupo se distinguían a lo lejos, y siguieron todos adelante.\r\n     Pero no habían andado veinte pasos, cuando sintieron el\r\n[25] galopar de un caballo que tras ellos venía con tanta rapidez,\r\n     que por momentos les alcanzaba. Volvióse nuestro viajero\r\n     y vió un hombre, mejor dicho, un Centauro, pues no podía\r\n     concebirse más perfecta armonía entre caballo y ginete, el\r\n     cual era de complexión recia y sanguínea, ojos grandes,\r\n[30] ardientes, cabeza ruda, negros bigotes, mediana edad y el\r\n     aspecto en general brusco y provocativo, con indicios de\r\n     fuerza en toda su persona. Montaba un soberbio caballo\r\n     de pecho carnoso, semejante a los del Partenón, enjaezado\r\n     según el modo pintoresco del país, y sobre la grupa llevaba\r\n     una gran balija de cuero, en cuya tapa se veía en letras        12\r\n     gordas la palabra _Correo_.\r\n\r\n     --Hola, buenos días, Sr. Caballuco--dijo Licurgo, saludando\r\n     al ginete, cuando estuvo cerca.--¡Cómo le hemos\r\n[5]  tomado la delantera! pero usted llegará antes si se pone\r\n     a ello.\r\n\r\n     --Descansemos un poco--repuso el señor Caballuco,\r\n     poniendo su cabalgadura al paso de la de nuestros viajeros,\r\n     y observando atentamente al más principal de los tres.--\r\n[10] Puesto que hay tan buena compaña....\r\n\r\n     --El señor--dijo Licurgo sonriendo,--es el sobrino de\r\n     doña Perfecta.\r\n\r\n     --¡Ah!... por muchos años... muy señor mío y\r\n     mi dueño....\r\n\r\n[15] Ambos personajes se saludaron, siendo de notar que\r\n     Caballuco hizo sus urbanidades con una expresión de altanería\r\n     y superioridad que revelaba cuando menos la conciencia\r\n     de un gran valer o de una alta posición en la comarca.\r\n     Cuando el orgulloso ginete se apartó y por breve momento\r\n[20] se detuvo hablando con dos Guardias civiles que llegaron\r\n     al camino, el viajero preguntó a su guía:\r\n\r\n     --¿Quién es este pájaro?\r\n\r\n     --¿Quién ha de ser? Caballuco.\r\n\r\n     --¿Y quién es Caballuco?\r\n\r\n[25] --¡Toma!... ¿pero no le ha oído usted nombrar?--\r\n     dijo el labriego, asombrado de la ignorancia supina del\r\n     sobrino de doña Perfecta.--Es un hombre muy valiente,\r\n     gran ginete, y el primer caballista de todas estas tierras a la\r\n     redonda. En Orbajosa le queremos mucho; pues él es...\r\n[30] dicho sea en verdad... tan bueno como la bendición de\r\n     Dios... Ahí donde le ve, es un cacique tremendo, y el\r\n     Gobernador de la provincia se le quita el sombrero.\r\n\r\n     --Cuando hay elecciones...\r\n\r\n     --Y el Gobierno de Madrid le escribe oficios con mucha\r\n     vuecencia en el rétulo.... Tira a la barra como un San          13\r\n     Cristóbal, y todas las armas las maneja como manejamos\r\n     nosotros nuestros propios dedos. Cuando había fielato no\r\n     podían con él, y todas las noches sonaban tiros en las\r\n[5]  puertas de la ciudad... Tiene una gente que vale cualquier\r\n     dinero, porque lo mismo es para un fregado que para\r\n     un barrido.... Favorece a los pobres, y el que venga de\r\n     fuera y se atreva a tentar el pelo de la ropa a un hijo\r\n     de Orbajosa, ya puede verse con él.... Aquí no vienen\r\n[10] casi nunca soldados de los Madriles; cuando han estado,\r\n     todos los días corría la sangre, porque Caballuco les buscaba\r\n     camorra por un no y por un sí. Ahora parece que vive en\r\n     la pobreza y se ha quedado con la conducción del correo;\r\n     pero está metiendo fuego en el Ayuntamiento para que haya\r\n[15] otra vez fielato y rematarlo él. No sé cómo no le ha oído\r\n     usted nombrar en Madrid, porque es hijo de un famoso\r\n     Caballuco que estuvo en la facción, el cual Caballuco padre\r\n     era hijo de otro Caballuco abuelo, que también estuvo en la\r\n     facción de más allá.... Y como ahora andan diciendo que\r\n[20] vuelve a haber facción, porque todo está torcido y revuelto,\r\n     tememos que Caballuco se nos vaya también a ella, poniendo\r\n     fin de esta manera a las hazañas de su padre y abuelo, que\r\n     por gloria nuestra nacieron en esta ciudad.\r\n\r\n     Sorprendido quedó nuestro viajero al ver la especie de\r\n[25] caballería andante que aún subsistía en los lugares que\r\n     visitaba, pero no tuvo ocasión de hacer nuevas preguntas,\r\n     porque el mismo que era objeto de ellas se les incorporó,\r\n     diciendo de mal talante:\r\n\r\n     --La Guardia civil ha despachado a tres. Ya le he dicho\r\n[30] al cabo que se ande con cuidado. Mañana hablaremos el\r\n     Gobernador de la provincia y yo....\r\n\r\n     --¿Va usted a X?\r\n\r\n     --No, que el Gobernador viene acá, señor Licurgo; sepa\r\n     usted que nos van a meter en Orbajosa un par de regimientos.\r\n\r\n     --Sí--dijo vivamente el viajero, sonriendo.--En Madrid          14\r\n     oí decir que había temor de que se levantaran en este país\r\n     algunas partidillas... Bueno es prevenirse.\r\n\r\n     --En Madrid no dicen más que desatinos...--exclamó\r\n[5]  violentamente el Centauro, acompañando su afirmación de\r\n     una retahíla de vocablos de esos que levantan ampolla. En\r\n     Madrid no hay más que pillería... ¿A qué nos mandan\r\n     soldados? ¿Para sacarnos más contribuciones y un par\r\n     de quintas seguidas? ¡Por vida de!... que si no hay\r\n[10] facción debería haberla. Con que usted--añadió, mirando\r\n     socarronamente al joven caballero,--¿con que usted es el\r\n     sobrino de doña Perfecta?\r\n\r\n     Esta salida de tono y el insolente mirar del bravo\r\n     enfadaron al joven.\r\n\r\n[15] --Sí, señor. ¿Se le ofrece a usted algo?\r\n\r\n     --Soy amigo de la señora y la quiero como a las niñas\r\n     de mis ojos--dijo Caballuco.--Puesto que usted va a\r\n     Orbajosa, allá nos veremos.\r\n\r\n     Y sin decir más picó espuelas a su corcel, el cual, partiendo\r\n[20] a escape, desapareció entre una nube de polvo.\r\n\r\n     Después de media hora de camino, durante la cual el Sr.\r\n     D. José no se mostró muy comunicativo, ni el Sr. Licurgo\r\n     tampoco, apareció a los ojos de entrambos apiñado y viejo\r\n     caserío asentado en una loma, y del cual se destacaban\r\n[25] algunas negras torres y la ruinosa fábrica de un\r\n     despedazado castillo en lo más alto. Un amasijo de paredes\r\n     deformes de casuchas de tierra pardas y polvorosas como el\r\n     suelo, formaba la base, con algunos fragmentos de\r\n     almenadas murallas, a cuyo amparo mil chozas humildes alzaban\r\n[30] sus miserables frontispicios de adobes, semejantes a caras\r\n     anémicas y hambrientas que pedían una limosna al\r\n     pasajero. Pobrísimo río ceñía, como un cinturón de hojalata,\r\n     el pueblo, refrescando al pasar algunas huertas, única\r\n     frondosidad que alegraba la vista. Entraba y salía la gente en\r\n     caballerías o a pie, y el movimiento humano, aunque pequeño,    15\r\n     daba cierta apariencia vital a aquella gran morada, cuyo\r\n     aspecto arquitectónico era más bien de ruina y muerte que\r\n     de progreso y vida. Los innumerables y repugnantes\r\n[5]  mendigos que se arrastraban a un lado y otro del camino,\r\n     pidiendo el óbolo del pasajero, ofrecían lastimoso espectáculo.\r\n     No podían verse existencias que mejor cuadraran, ni que\r\n     más apropiadas fueran a las grietas de aquel sepulcro,\r\n     donde una ciudad estaba no sólo enterrada sino también\r\n[10] podrida. Cuando nuestros viajeros se acercaban, algunas\r\n     campanas tocando desacordemente indicaban con su\r\n     expresivo son que aquella momia tenía todavía un alma.\r\n\r\n     Llamábase Orbajosa, ciudad que no en Geografía caldea\r\n     o cophta, sino en la de España, figura con 7,324 habitantes,\r\n[15] Ayuntamiento, sede episcopal, partido judicial, seminario,\r\n     depósito de caballos sementales, instituto de segunda\r\n     enseñanza y otras prerogativas oficiales.\r\n\r\n     --Están tocando a misa mayor en la catedral--dijo el\r\n     tío Licurgo.--Llegamos antes de lo que pensé.\r\n\r\n[20] --El aspecto de su patria de usted--dijo el caballero,\r\n     examinando el panorama que delante tenía,--no puede ser\r\n     más desagradable. La histórica ciudad de Orbajosa,[1] cuyo\r\n     nombre es, sin duda, corrupción de _urbs augusta_, parece un\r\n     gran muladar.\r\n\r\n[Nota 1: Ya se ha dicho que todos los nombres locales son imaginarios.]\r\n\r\n[25] --Es que de aquí no se ven más que los arrabales--afirmó\r\n     con disgusto el guía.--Cuando entre usted en la\r\n     calle Real y en la del Condestable, verá fábricas tan hermosas\r\n     como la de la catedral.\r\n\r\n     --- No quiero hablar mal de Orbajosa antes de conocerla--dijo\r\n[30] el caballero.--Lo que he dicho no es tampoco señal\r\n     de desprecio; que humilde y miserable, lo mismo que\r\n     hermosa y soberbia, esa ciudad será siempre para mí muy\r\n     querida, no sólo por ser patria de mi madre, sino porque en\r\n     ella viven personas a quienes amo ya sin conocerlas. Entremos,  16\r\n     pues, en la ciudad _augusta_.\r\n\r\n     Subían ya por una calzada próxima a las primeras calles,\r\n     e iban tocando las tapias de las huertas.\r\n\r\n[5]  --¿Ve usted aquella gran casa que está al fin de esta\r\n     gran huerta por cuyo bardal pasamos ahora?--dijo el tío\r\n     Licurgo, señalando el enorme paredón revocado de la única\r\n     vivienda que tenía aspecto de habitabilidad cómoda y alegre.\r\n\r\n     --Ya... ¿aquella es la vivienda de mi tía?\r\n\r\n[10] --Justo y cabal. Lo que vemos es la parte trasera de la\r\n     casa. El frontis da a la calle del Condestable, y tiene cinco\r\n     balcones de hierro que parecen cinco castillos. Esta hermosa\r\n     huerta que hay tras la tapia es la de la casa, y si usted\r\n     se alza sobre los estribos, la verá toda desde aquí.\r\n\r\n[15] --Pues estamos ya en casa--dijo el caballero.--¿No se\r\n     puede entrar por aquí?\r\n\r\n     --Hay una puertecilla; pero la señora la mandó tapiar.\r\n\r\n     El caballero se alzó sobre los estribos, y alargando cuanto\r\n     pudo la cabeza, miró por encima de las bardas.\r\n\r\n[20] --Veo la huerta toda--indicó.--Allí, bajo aquellos árboles,\r\n     está una mujer, una chiquilla... una señorita....\r\n\r\n     --Es la señorita Rosario--repuso Licurgo.\r\n\r\n     Y al instante se alzó también sobre los estribos para\r\n     mirar.\r\n\r\n[25] --¡Eh! señorita Rosario--gritó, haciendo con la derecha\r\n     mano gestos muy significativos.--Ya estamos aquí...\r\n     aquí le traigo a su primo.\r\n\r\n     --Nos ha visto--dijo el caballero, estirando el pescuezo\r\n     hasta el último grado.--Pero si no me engaño, al lado de\r\n[30] ella está un clérigo... un señor sacerdote.\r\n\r\n     --Es el señor Penitenciario--repuso con naturalidad el\r\n     labriego.\r\n\r\n     --Mi prima nos ve... deja solo al clérigo, y echa a\r\n     correr hacia la casa... Es bonita....\r\n\r\n     --Como un sol.                                                  17\r\n\r\n     --Se ha puesto más encarnada que una cereza. Vamos,\r\n     vamos, Sr. Licurgo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   III\r\n\r\n                               =Pepe Rey=\r\n\r\n     Antes de pasar adelante, conviene decir quién era Pepe\r\n[5]  Rey y qué asuntos le llevaban a Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     Cuando el brigadier Rey murió en 1841, sus dos hijos,\r\n     Juan y Perfecta, acababan de casarse, ésta con el más rico\r\n     proprietario de Orbajosa, aquél con una joven de la misma\r\n     ciudad. Llamábase el esposo de Perfecta don Manuel María\r\n[10] José de Polentinos, y la mujer de Juan, María Polentinos;\r\n     pero a pesar de la igualdad de apellido, su parentesco era\r\n     un poco lejano y de aquellos que no coge un galgo. Juan\r\n     Rey era insigne jurisconsulto graduado en Sevilla, y ejerció\r\n     la abogacía en esta misma ciudad durante treinta años, con\r\n[15] tanta gloria como provecho. En 1845 era ya viudo y tenía\r\n     un hijo que empezaba a hacer diabluras; solía tener por\r\n     entretenimiento el construir con tierra en el patio de la\r\n     casa viaductos, malecones, estanques, presas, acequias,\r\n     soltando después el agua para que entre aquellas frágiles\r\n[20] obras corriese. El padre le dejaba hacer y decía: \"tú serás\r\n     ingeniero.\"\r\n\r\n     Perfecta y Juan dejaron de verse desde que uno y otro\r\n     se casaron, porque ella se fué a vivir a Madrid con el\r\n     opulentísimo Polentinos, que tenía tanta hacienda como buena\r\n[25] mano para gastarla. El juego y las mujeres cautivaban de\r\n     tal modo el corazón de Manuel María José, que habría dado\r\n     en tierra con toda su fortuna, si más pronto que él para\r\n     derrocharla no estuviera la muerte para llevárselo a él. En\r\n     una noche de orgía acabaron de súbito los días de aquel\r\n[30] ricacho provinciano, tan vorazmente chupado por las sanguijuelas\r\n     de la corte y por el insaciable vampiro del juego.              18\r\n     Su única heredera era una niña de pocos meses. Con la\r\n     muerte del esposo de Perfecta se acabaron los sustos en\r\n     la familia; pero empezó el gran conflicto. La casa de\r\n[5]  Polentinos estaba arruinada; las fincas en peligro de ser\r\n     arrebatadas por los prestamistas, todo en desorden, enormes\r\n     deudas, lamentable administración en Orbajosa, descrédito\r\n     y ruina en Madrid.\r\n\r\n     Perfecta llamó a su hermano, el cual, acudiendo en auxilio\r\n[10] de la pobre viuda, mostró tanta diligencia y tino, que al\r\n     poco tiempo la mayor parte de los peligros habían\r\n     desaparecido. Principió por obligar a su hermana a residir en\r\n     Orbajosa, administrando por sí misma sus vastas tierras, mientras\r\n     él hacía frente en Madrid al formidable empuje de los\r\n[15] acreedores. Poco a poco fué descargándose la casa del\r\n     enorme fardo de sus deudas, porque el bueno de D. Juan\r\n     Rey, que tenía la mejor mano del mundo para tales asuntos,\r\n     lidió con la curia, hizo contratos con los principales\r\n     acreedores, estableció plazos para el pago, resultando de este\r\n[20] hábil trabajo que el riquísimo patrimonio de Polentinos\r\n     saliese a flote, y pudiera seguir dando por luengos años\r\n     esplendor y gloria a la ilustre familia.\r\n\r\n     La gratitud de Perfecta era tan viva, que al escribir a su\r\n     hermano desde Orbajosa, donde resolvió residir hasta que\r\n[25] creciera su hija, le decía entre otras ternezas: \"Has sido\r\n     más que hermano para mí, y para mi hija más que su propio\r\n     padre. ¿Cómo te pagaremos ella y yo tan grandes\r\n     beneficios? ¡Ay! querido hermano, desde que mi hija sepa\r\n     discurrir y pronunciar un nombre, yo le enseñaré a bendecir\r\n[30] el tuyo. Mi agradecimiento durará toda mi vida. Tu\r\n     hermana indigna siente no encontrar ocasión de mostrarte lo\r\n     mucho que te ama y de recompensarte de un modo apropiado\r\n     a la grandeza de tu alma y a la inmensa bondad de\r\n     tu corazón.\"\r\n\r\n     Cuando esto se escribía, Rosarito tenía dos años. Pepe          19\r\n     Rey, encerrado en un colegio de Sevilla, hacía rayas en un\r\n     papel, ocupándose en probar que _la suma de los ángulos\r\n     interiores de un polígono vale tantas veces dos rectos como lados\r\n[5]  tiene menos dos_. Estas enfadosas perogrulladas le traían\r\n     muy atareado. Pasaron años y más años. El muchacho\r\n     crecía y no cesaba de hacer rayas. Por último, hizo una\r\n     que se llama _De Tarragona a Montblanch_. Su primer\r\n     juguete formal fué el puente de 120 metros sobre el río\r\n[10] Francolí.\r\n\r\n     Durante mucho tiempo, doña Perfecta siguió viviendo en\r\n     Orbajosa. Como su hermano no salió de Sevilla, pasaron\r\n     unos pocos años sin que uno y otro se vieran. Una carta\r\n     trimestral, tan puntualmente escrita como puntualmente\r\n[15] contestada, ponía en comunicación aquellos dos corazones,\r\n     cuya ternura ni el tiempo ni la distancia podían enfriar.\r\n     En 1870, cuando D. Juan Rey, satisfecho de haber\r\n     desempeñado bien su misión en la sociedad, se retiró a vivir en su\r\n     hermosa casa de Puerto Real, Pepe, que ya había trabajado\r\n[20] algunos años en las obras de varias poderosas compañías\r\n     constructoras, emprendió un viaje de estudio a Alemania e\r\n     Inglaterra. La fortuna de su padre (tan grande como puede\r\n     serlo en España la que sólo tiene por origen un honrado\r\n     bufete), le permitía librarse en breves períodos del yugo del\r\n[25] trabajo material. Hombre de elevadas ideas y de inmenso\r\n     amor a la ciencia, hallaba su más puro goce en la\r\n     observación y estudio de los prodigios con que el genio del siglo\r\n     sabe cooperar a la cultura y bienestar físico y\r\n     perfeccionamiento moral del hombre.\r\n\r\n[30] Al regresar del viaje, su padre le anunció la revelación de\r\n     un importante proyecto, y como Pepe creyera que se trataba\r\n     de un puente, dársena o cuando menos saneamiento de\r\n     marismas, sacóle de tal error D. Juan, manifestándole su\r\n     pensamiento en estos términos:\r\n\r\n     --Estamos en Marzo y la carta trimestral de Perfecta no         20\r\n     podía faltar. Querido hijo, léela, y si estás conforme con\r\n     lo que en ella manifiesta esa santa y ejemplar mujer, mi\r\n     querida hermana, me darás la mayor felicidad que en mi\r\n[5]  vejez puedo desear. Si no te gustase el proyecto, deséchalo\r\n     sin reparo, aunque tu negativa me entristezca; que en él\r\n     no hay ni sombra de imposición por parte mía. Sería\r\n     indigno de mí y de ti que esto se realizase por coacción de\r\n     un padre terco. Eres libre de aceptar o no, y si hay en tu\r\n[10] voluntad la más ligera resistencia, originada en ley del\r\n     corazón o en otra causa, no quiero que te violentes por mí.\r\n\r\n     Pepe dejó la carta sobre la mesa, después de pasar la\r\n     vista por ella, y tranquilamente dijo:\r\n\r\n     --Mi tía quiere que me case con Rosario.\r\n\r\n[15] --Ella contesta aceptando con gozo mi idea--dijo el\r\n     padre muy conmovido.--Porque la idea fué mía... sí,\r\n     hace tiempo, hace tiempo que la concebí... pero no había\r\n     querido decirte nada, antes de conocer el pensamiento de\r\n     mi hermana. Como ves, Perfecta acoge con júbilo mi plan;\r\n[20] dice que también había pensado en lo mismo; pero que no\r\n     se atrevía a manifestármelo, por ser tú... ¿no ves lo que\r\n     dice? \"por ser tú un joven de singularísimo mérito, y su\r\n     hija una joven aldeana educada sin brillantez, ni\r\n     mundanales atractivos....\" Así mismo lo dice.... ¡Pobre\r\n[25] hermana mía! ¡Qué buena es!... Veo que no te\r\n     enfadas; veo que no te parece absurdo este proyecto mío, algo\r\n     parecido a la previsión oficiosa de los padres de antaño, que\r\n     casaban a sus hijos sin consultárselo, y las más veces\r\n     haciendo uniones disparatadas y prematuras.... Dios\r\n[30] quiera que ésta sea o prometa ser de las más felices. Es\r\n     verdad que no conoces a mi sobrina; pero tú y yo tenemos\r\n     noticias de su virtud, de su discreción, de su modestia y\r\n     noble sencillez. Para que nada le falte, hasta es bonita....\r\n     Mi opinión--añadió festivamente,--es que te pongas en\r\n     camino y pises el suelo de esa recóndita ciudad episcopal,      21\r\n     de esa _urbs augusta_, y allí, en presencia de mi hermana y\r\n     de su graciosa Rosarito, resuelvas si ésta ha de ser algo más\r\n     que mi sobrina.\r\n\r\n[5]  Pepe volvió a tomar la carta y la leyó con cuidado. Su\r\n     semblante no expresaba alegría ni pesadumbre. Parecía\r\n     estar examinando un proyecto de empalme de dos vías\r\n     férreas.\r\n\r\n     --Por cierto--decía D. Juan,--que en esa remota\r\n[10] Orbajosa, donde, entre paréntesis, tienes fincas que puedes\r\n     examinar ahora, se pasa la vida con la tranquilidad y dulzura\r\n     de los idilios. ¡Qué patriarcales costumbres! ¡Qué\r\n     nobleza en aquella sencillez! ¡Qué rústica paz virgiliana!\r\n     Si en vez de ser matemático fueras latinista, repetirías al\r\n[15] entrar allí el _ergo tua rura manebunt_. ¡Qué admirable lugar\r\n     para dedicarse a la contemplación de nuestra propia alma\r\n     y prepararse a las buenas obras! Allí todo es bondad,\r\n     honradez; allí no se conocen la mentira y la farsa como en\r\n     nuestras grandes ciudades; allí renacen las santas\r\n[20] inclinaciones que el bullicio de la moderna vida ahoga; allí\r\n     despierta la dormida fe, y se siente vivo impulso indefinible\r\n     dentro del pecho, al modo de pueril impaciencia que en el\r\n     fondo de nuestra alma grita: \"quiero vivir.\"\r\n\r\n     Pocos días después de esta conferencia, Pepe salió de\r\n[25] Puerto Real. Había rehusado meses antes una comisión\r\n     del Gobierno para examinar bajo el punto de vista minero\r\n     la cuenca del río Nahara en el valle de Orbajosa; pero los\r\n     proyectos a que dió lugar la conferencia referida, le hicieron\r\n     decir:--\"Conviene aprovechar el tiempo. Sabe Dios lo\r\n[30] que durará ese noviazgo y el aburrimiento que traerá\r\n     consigo.\" Dirigióse a Madrid, solicitó la comisión de explorar\r\n     la cuenca del Nahara, se la dieron sin dificultad, a pesar de\r\n     no pertenecer oficialmente al cuerpo de minas, púsose luego\r\n     en marcha, y después de trasbordar un par de veces, el tren\r\n     mixto número 65 le llevó, como se ha visto, a los amorosos      22\r\n     brazos del tío Licurgo.\r\n\r\n     Frisaba la edad de este excelente joven en los treinta y\r\n     cuatro años. Era de complexión fuerte y un tanto hercúlea,\r\n[5]  con rara perfección formado, y tan arrogante, que si llevara\r\n     uniforme militar, ofrecería el más guerrero aspecto y talle\r\n     que puede imaginarse. Rubios el cabello y la barba, no\r\n     tenía en su rostro la flemática imperturbabilidad de los\r\n     Sajones, sino por el contrario, una viveza tal, que sus ojos\r\n[10] parecían negros sin serlo. Su persona bien podía pasar por\r\n     un hermoso y acabado símbolo, y si fuera estatua, el escultor\r\n     habría grabado en el pedestal estas palabras: _inteligencia,\r\n     fuerza_. Si no en caracteres visibles, llevábalas él expresadas\r\n     vagamente en la luz de su mirar, en el poderoso atractivo\r\n[15] que era don propio de su persona, y en las simpatías a\r\n     que su trato cariñosamente convidaba.\r\n\r\n     No era de los más habladores: sólo los entendimientos\r\n     de ideas inseguras y de movedizo criterio propenden a la\r\n     verbosidad. El profundo sentido moral de aquel insigne\r\n[20] joven le hacía muy sobrio de palabras en las disputas que\r\n     constantemente traban sobre diversos asuntos los hombres\r\n     del día; pero en la conversación urbana sabía mostrar una\r\n     elocuencia picante y discreta, emanada siempre del buen\r\n     sentido y de la apreciación mesurada y justa de las cosas\r\n[25] del mundo. No admitía falsedades, ni mistificaciones, ni\r\n     esos retruécanos del pensamiento con que se divierten algunas\r\n     inteligencias impregnadas de gongorismo; y para volver\r\n     por los fueros de la realidad, Pepe Rey solía emplear a\r\n     veces, no siempre con comedimiento, las armas de la burla.\r\n[30] Esto casi era un defecto a los ojos de gran número de personas\r\n     que le estimaban, porque nuestro joven aparecía un\r\n     poco irrespetuoso en presencia de multitud de hechos comunes\r\n     en el mundo y admitidos por todos. Fuerza es decirlo,\r\n     aunque se amengüe su prestigio: Rey no conocía la dulce\r\n     tolerancia del condescendiente siglo que ha inventado singulares 23\r\n     velos de lenguaje y de hechos para cubrir lo que a los\r\n     vulgares ojos pudiera ser desagradable.\r\n\r\n     Así, y no de otra manera, por más que digan calumniadoras\r\n[5]  lenguas, era el hombre a quien el tío Licurgo introdujo\r\n     en Orbajosa en la hora y punto en que la campana de\r\n     la catedral tocaba a misa mayor. Luego que uno y otro,\r\n     atisbando por encima de los bardales, vieron a la niña y al\r\n     Penitenciario y la veloz corrida de aquélla hacia la casa,\r\n[10] picaron sus caballerías para entrar en la calle Real, donde\r\n     gran número de vagos se detenían para mirar al viajero\r\n     como extraño huésped intruso de la patriarcal ciudad. Torciendo\r\n     luego a la derecha, en dirección a la catedral, cuya\r\n     corpulenta fábrica dominaba todo el pueblo, tomaron la calle\r\n[15] del Condestable, en la cual, por ser estrecha y empedrada,\r\n     retumbaban con estridente sonsonete las herraduras, alarmando\r\n     al vecindario, que por ventanas y balcones se mostraba\r\n     para satisfacer su curiosidad. Abríanse con singular chasquido\r\n     las celosías, y caras diversas, casi todas de hembra,\r\n[20] asomaban arriba y abajo. Cuando Pepe Rey llegó al arquitectónico\r\n     umbral de la casa de Polentinos, ya se habían\r\n     hecho multitud de comentarios diversos sobre su figura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     IV\r\n\r\n                           =La llegada del primo=\r\n\r\n     EL señor Penitenciario, cuando Rosarito se separó bruscamente\r\n     de él, miró a los bardales, y viendo las cabezas del\r\n[25] tío Licurgo y de su compañero de viaje, dijo para sí:\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, ya está ahí ese prodigio.\r\n\r\n     Quedóse un rato meditabundo, sosteniendo el manteo con\r\n     ambas manos cruzadas sobre el abdomen, fija la vista en el\r\n     suelo, con los anteojos de oro deslizándose suavemente\r\n     hacia la punta de la nariz, saliente y húmedo el labio          24\r\n     inferior, y un poco fruncidas las blanquinegras cejas. Era\r\n     un santo varón piadoso y de no común saber, de intachables\r\n     costumbres clericales, algo más de sexagenario, de afable\r\n[5]  trato, fino y comedido, gran repartidor de consejos y advertencias\r\n     a hombres y mujeres. Desde luengos años era\r\n     maestro de latinidad y retórica en el Instituto, cuya noble\r\n     profesión dióle gran caudal de citas horacianas y de floridos\r\n     tropos, que empleaba con gracia y oportunidad. Nada más\r\n[10] conviene añadir acerca de este personaje, sino que cuando\r\n     sintió el trote largo de las cabalgaduras que corrían hacia la\r\n     calle del Condestable, se arregló el manteo, enderezó el sombrero,\r\n     que no estaba del todo bien puesto en la venerable\r\n     cabeza, y marchando hacia la casa, murmuró--\r\n\r\n[15] --Vamos a ver ese prodigio.\r\n\r\n     En tanto, Pepe bajaba de la jaca, y en el mismo portal le\r\n     recibía en sus amantes brazos doña Perfecta, anegado en\r\n     lágrimas el rostro y sin poder pronunciar sino palabras\r\n     breves y balbucientes, expresión sincera de su cariño.\r\n\r\n[20] --¡Pepe... pero qué grande estás!... y con barbas...\r\n     Me parece que fué ayer cuando te ponía sobre mis\r\n     rodillas... ya estás hecho un hombre, todo un hombre...\r\n     ¡Cómo pasan los años!... ¡Jesús! Aquí tienes a mi\r\n     hija Rosario.\r\n\r\n[25] Diciendo esto, habían llegado a la sala baja, ordinariamente\r\n     destinada a recibir, y doña Perfecta presentóle\r\n     a su hija.\r\n\r\n     Era Rosarita una muchacha de apariencia delicada y\r\n     débil, que anunciaba inclinaciones a lo que los portugueses\r\n[30] llaman _saudades_. En su rostro fino y puro se observaba\r\n     algo de la pastosidad nacarada, que la mayor parte de los\r\n     novelistas atribuyen a sus heroínas, y sin cuyo barniz sentimental\r\n     parece que ninguna Enriqueta y ninguna Julia\r\n     pueden ser interesantes. Pero lo principal en Rosario era\r\n     que tenía tal expresión de dulzura y modestia, que al verla     25\r\n     no se echaban de menos las perfecciones de que carecía.\r\n     No es esto decir que era fea; mas también es cierto que\r\n     habría pasado por hiperbólico el que la llamara hermosa,\r\n[5]  dando a esta palabra su riguroso sentido. La hermosura\r\n     real de la niña de doña Perfecta consistía en una especie\r\n     de trasparencia, prescindiendo del nácar, del alabastro, del\r\n     marfil y demás materias usadas en la composición descriptiva\r\n     de los rostros humanos; una especie de transparencia, digo,\r\n[10] por la cual todos las honduras de su alma se veían\r\n     claramente, honduras no cavernosas y horribles como las del\r\n     mar, sino como las de un manso y claro río. Pero allí\r\n     faltaba materia para que la persona fuese completa; faltaba\r\n     cauce, faltaban orillas. El vasto caudal de su espíritu se\r\n[15] desbordaba, amenazando devorar las estrechas riberas. Al\r\n     ser saludada por su primo se puso como la grana, y sólo\r\n     pronunció algunas palabras torpes.\r\n\r\n     --Estarás desmayado--dijo doña Perfecta a su sobrino.--Ahora\r\n     mismo te daremos de almorzar.\r\n\r\n[20] --Con permiso de usted--repuso el viajero,--voy a\r\n     quitarme el polvo del camino....\r\n\r\n     --Muy bien pensado--dijo la señora.--Rosario, lleva\r\n     a tu primo al cuarto que le hemos preparado. Despáchate\r\n     pronto, sobrino. Voy a dar mis órdenes.\r\n\r\n[25] Rosario llevó a su primo a una hermosa habitación situada\r\n     en el piso bajo. Desde que puso el pie dentro de ella, Pepe\r\n     reconoció en todos los detalles de la vivienda la mano\r\n     diligente y cariñosa de una mujer. Todo estaba puesto con\r\n     arte singular, y el aseo y frescura de cuanto allí había\r\n[30] convidaban a reposar en tan hermoso nido. El huésped\r\n     reparó minuciosidades que le hicieron reír.\r\n\r\n     --Aquí tienes la campanilla--dijo Rosarito, tomando el\r\n     cordón de ella, cuya borla caía sobre la cabecera del lecho.\r\n\r\n     --No tienes más que alargar la mano. La mesa de escribir\r\n     está puesta de modo que recibas la luz por la izquierda....     26\r\n     Mira, en esta cesta echarás los papeles rotos....\r\n     ¿Tú fumas?\r\n\r\n     --Tengo esa desgracia--repuso Pepe Rey.\r\n\r\n[5]  --Pues aquí puedes echar las puntas de cigarro--dijo\r\n     ella, tocando con la punta del pie un mueble de latón dorado\r\n     lleno de arena.--No hay cosa más fea que ver el suelo lleno\r\n     de colillas de cigarro.... Mira el lavabo.... Para la ropa\r\n     tienes un ropero y una cómoda.... Creo que la relojera\r\n[10] está mal aquí y se te debe poner junto a la cama.... Si te\r\n     molesta la luz, no tienes más que correr el transparente\r\n     tirando de la cuerda... ¿ves?... rich....\r\n\r\n     El ingeniero estaba encantado.\r\n\r\n     Rosarito abrió una ventana.\r\n\r\n[15] --Mira--dijo--esta ventana da a la huerta. Por aquí\r\n     entra el sol de tarde. Aquí tenemos colgado la jaula de un\r\n     canario, que canta como un loco. Si te molesta, la\r\n     quitaremos.\r\n\r\n     Abrió otra ventana del testero opuesto.\r\n\r\n[20] --Esta otra ventana--añadió,--da a la calle. Mira,\r\n     de aquí se ve la catedral, que es muy hermosa y está llena\r\n     de preciosidades. Vienen muchos Ingleses a verla. No\r\n     abras las dos ventanas a un tiempo, porque las corrientes\r\n     de aire son muy malas.\r\n\r\n[25] --Querida prima--dijo Pepe, con el alma inundada de\r\n     inexplicable gozo--en todo lo que está delante de mis\r\n     ojos veo una mano de ángel que no puede ser sino la tuya.\r\n     ¡Qué hermoso cuarto es este! Me parece que he vivido\r\n     en él toda mi vida. Está convidando a la paz.\r\n\r\n[30] Rosarito no contestó nada a estas cariñosas expresiones,\r\n     y sonriendo salió.\r\n\r\n     --No tardes--dijo desde la puerta;--el comedor está\r\n     también abajo... en el centro de esta galería.\r\n\r\n     Entró el tío Licurgo con el equipaje. Pepe le recompensó\r\n     con una largueza a que el labriego no estaba acostumbrado;      27\r\n     y éste, después de dar las gracias con humildad, llevóse la\r\n     mano a la cabeza, como quien ni se pone ni se quita el\r\n     sombrero, y en tono embarazoso, mascando las palabras,\r\n[5]  como quien no dice ni deja de decir las cosas, se expresó\r\n     de este modo:\r\n\r\n     --¿Cuándo será la mejor hora para hablar al Sr. D. José\r\n     de un... de un asuntillo?\r\n\r\n     --¿De un asuntillo? Ahora mismo--repuso Pepe,\r\n[10] abriendo un baúl.\r\n\r\n     --No es oportunidad--dijo el labriego.--Descanse el\r\n     Sr. D. José, que tiempo tenemos. Más días hay que\r\n     longanizas, como dijo el otro; y un día viene tras otro día....\r\n     Que usted descanse, Sr. D. José.... Cuando quiera dar\r\n[15] un paseo... la jaca no es mala.... Con que buenos\r\n     días, Sr. D. José. Que viva usted mil años.... ¡Ah! se\r\n     me olvidaba--añadió, volviendo a entrar después de\r\n     algunos segundos de ausencia.--Si quiere usted algo para el\r\n     señor juez municipal.... Ahora voy allá a hablarle de\r\n[20] nuestro asuntillo....\r\n\r\n     --Déle usted expresiones--dijo festivamente, no\r\n     encontrando mejor fórmula para sacudirse de encima al legislador\r\n     espartano.\r\n\r\n     --Pues quede con Dios el Sr. D. José.\r\n\r\n[25] --Abur.\r\n\r\n     El ingeniero no había sacado su ropa, cuando aparecieron\r\n     por tercera vez en la puerta los sagaces ojuelos y la\r\n     marrullera fisonomía del tío Licurgo.\r\n\r\n     --Perdone el Sr. D. José--dijo mostrando en afectada\r\n[30] risa sus blanquísimos dientes.--Pero... quería decirle\r\n     que si usted desea que esto se arregle por amigables\r\n     componedores.... Aunque, como dijo el otro, pon lo tuyo en\r\n     consejo y unos dirán que es blanco y otros que es negro....\r\n\r\n     --Hombre, ¿quiere usted irse de aquí?\r\n\r\n     --Dígolo porque a mí me carga la justicia. No quiero            28\r\n     nada con justicia. Del lobo un pelo y ese de la frente.\r\n     Con que con Dios, Sr. don José. Dios le conserve sus días\r\n     para favorecer a los pobres....\r\n\r\n[5]  --Adiós, hombre, adiós.\r\n\r\n     Pepe echó la llave a la puerta y dijo para sí:\r\n\r\n     --La gente de este pueblo parece ser muy pleitista.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    V\r\n\r\n                        _¿Habrá desavenencia?_\r\n\r\n     Poco después Pepe se presentaba en el comedor.\r\n\r\n     --Si almuerzas fuerte--le dijo doña Perfecta con\r\n[10] cariñoso acento,--se te va a quitar la gana de comer. Aquí\r\n     comemos a la una. Las modas del campo no te gustarán.\r\n\r\n     --Me encantan, señora tía.\r\n\r\n     --Pues di lo que prefieres: ¿almorzar fuerte ahora o\r\n     tomar una cosita ligera para que resistas hasta la hora de\r\n[15] comer?\r\n\r\n     --Escojo la cosa ligera para tener el gusto de comer con\r\n     ustedes; y si en Villahorrenda hubiera encontrado algún\r\n     alimento, nada tomaría a esta hora.\r\n\r\n     --Por supuesto, no necesito decirte que nos trates con\r\n[20] toda franqueza. Aquí puedes mandar como si estuvieras\r\n     en tu casa.\r\n\r\n     --Gracias, tía.\r\n\r\n     --¡Pero cómo te pareces a tu padre!--añadió la señora,\r\n     contemplando con verdadero arrobamiento al joven mientras\r\n[25] éste comía.\r\n\r\n     --Me parece que estoy mirando a mi querido hermano\r\n     Juan. Se sentaba como te sientas tú y comía lo mismo que\r\n     tú. En el modo de mirar sobre todo sois como dos gotas\r\n     de agua.\r\n\r\n     Pepe la emprendió con el frugal desayuno. Las expresiones,      29\r\n     así como la actitud y las miradas de su tía y prima, le\r\n     infundían tal confianza, que se creía ya en su propia casa.\r\n\r\n     --¿Sabes lo que me decía Rosario esta mañana?--indicó\r\n[5]  doña Perfecta, fija la vista en su sobrino,--Pues me decía\r\n     que tú, como hombre hecho a las pompas y etiquetas de la\r\n     corte y a las modas del extranjero, no podrás soportar esta\r\n     sencillez un poco rústica con que vivimos y esta falta de\r\n     buen tono, pues aquí todo es a la pata la llana.\r\n\r\n[10] --¡Qué error!--repuso Pepe, mirando a su prima.--Nadie\r\n     aborrece más que yo las falsedades y comedias de lo\r\n     que llaman alta sociedad. Crean ustedes que hace tiempo\r\n     deseo darme, como decía no sé quién, un baño de cuerpo\r\n     entero en la Naturaleza; vivir lejos del bullicio, en la soledad\r\n[15] y sosiego del campo. Anhelo la tranquilidad de una\r\n     vida sin luchas, sin afanes, ni envidioso ni envidiado, como\r\n     dijo el poeta. Durante mucho tiempo, mis estudios primero\r\n     y mis trabajos después, me han impedido el descanso que\r\n     necesito y que reclaman mi espíritu y mi cuerpo; pero\r\n[20] desde que entré en esta casa, querida tía, querida prima, me\r\n     he sentido rodeado de la atmósfera de paz que deseo. No\r\n     hay que hablarme, pues, de sociedades altas ni bajas, ni de\r\n     mundos grandes ni chicos, porque de buen grado los cambio\r\n     todos por este rincón.\r\n\r\n[25] Esto decía, cuando los cristales de la puerta que comunicaba\r\n     el comedor con la huerta se obscurecieron por la\r\n     superposición de una larga opacidad negra. Los vidrios\r\n     de unos espejuelos despidieron, heridos por la luz de sol,\r\n     fugitivo rayo; rechinó el picaporte, abrióse la puerta, y el\r\n[30] señor Penitenciario penetró con gravedad en la estancia.\r\n     Saludó y se inclinó, quitándose la canaleja hasta tocar con\r\n     el ala de ella al suelo.\r\n\r\n     --Es el señor Penitenciario de esta Santa Catedral--dijo\r\n     doña Perfecta,--persona a quien estimamos mucho y\r\n     de quien espero serás amigo. Siéntese usted, Sr. D.             30\r\n     Inocencio.\r\n\r\n     Pepe estrechó la mano del venerable canónigo, y ambos\r\n     se sentaron.\r\n\r\n[5]  --Pepe, si acostumbras fumar después de comer, no\r\n     dejes de hacerlo--manifestó benévolamente doña Perfecta,--ni\r\n     el señor Penitenciario tampoco.\r\n\r\n     A la sazón el buen D. Inocencio sacaba de debajo de la\r\n     sotana una gran petaca de cuero, marcada con irrecusables\r\n[10] señales de antiquísimo uso, y la abrió, desenvainando de\r\n     ella dos largos pitillos, uno de los cuales ofreció a nuestro\r\n     amigo. De un cartoncejo que irónicamente llaman los\r\n     españoles _wagón_, sacó Rosario un fósforo, y bien pronto\r\n     ingeniero y canónigo echaban su humo el uno sobre el otro.\r\n\r\n[15] --¿Y qué le parece al Sr. D. José nuestra querida ciudad\r\n     de Orbajosa?--preguntó el canónigo, cerrando fuertemente\r\n     el ojo izquierdo, según su costumbre mientras fumaba.\r\n\r\n     --Todavía no he podido formar idea de este pueblo--dijo\r\n     Pepe.--Por lo poco que he visto, me parece que no le\r\n[20] vendrían mal a Orbajosa media docena de grandes capitales\r\n     dispuestos a emplearse aquí, un par de cabezas inteligentes\r\n     que dirigieran la renovación de este país y algunos miles\r\n     de manos activas. Desde la entrada del pueblo hasta la\r\n     puerta de esta casa he visto más de cien mendigos. La\r\n[25] mayor parte son hombres sanos y aun robustos. Es un\r\n     ejército lastimoso, cuya vista oprime el corazón.\r\n\r\n     --- Para eso está la caridad--afirmó don Inocencio.--Por\r\n     lo demás, Orbajosa no es un pueblo miserable. Ya sabe\r\n     usted que aquí se producen los primeros ajos de toda España.\r\n[30] Pasan de veinte las familias ricas que viven entre nosotros.\r\n\r\n     --Verdad es--indicó doña Perfecta--que los últimos\r\n     años han sido detestables a causa de la seca; pero aun así\r\n     las paneras no están vacías, y se han llevado últimamente\r\n     al mercado muchos miles de ristras de ajos.\r\n\r\n     --En tantos años que llevo de residencia en Orbajosa--dijo     31\r\n     el clérigo, frunciendo el ceño--he visto llegar aquí\r\n     innumerables personajes de la Corte, traídos unos por la\r\n     gresca electoral, otros por visitar algún abandonado terruño\r\n[5]  o ver las antigüedades de la catedral, y todos entran\r\n     hablándonos de arados ingleses, de trilladoras mecánicas, de\r\n     saltos de aguas, de bancos y qué sé yo cuántas majaderías.\r\n     El estribillo es que esto es muy malo y que podía ser mejor.\r\n     Váyanse con mil demonios, que aquí estamos muy bien sin\r\n[10] que los señores de la Corte nos visiten, mucho mejor sin oír\r\n     ese continuo clamoreo de nuestra pobreza y de las grandezas\r\n     y maravillas de otras partes. Más sabe el loco en su casa\r\n     que el cuerdo en la ajena, ¿no es verdad, Sr. D. José? Por\r\n     supuesto, no se crea ni remotamente que lo digo por usted.\r\n[15] De ninguna manera. Pues no faltaba más. Ya sé que\r\n     tenemos delante a uno de los jóvenes más eminentes de la\r\n     España moderna, a un hombre que sería capaz de transformar\r\n     en riquísimas comarcas nuestras áridas estepas....\r\n     Ni me incomodo porque usted me cante la vieja canción de\r\n[20] los arados ingleses y la arboricultura y la selvicultura....\r\n     Nada de eso; a hombres de tanto, de tantísimo talento, se\r\n     les puede dispensar el desprecio que muestran hacia nuestra\r\n     humildad. Nada, amigo mío, nada, Sr. D. José, está usted\r\n     autorizado para todo, incluso para decirnos que somos poco\r\n[25] menos que cafres.\r\n\r\n     Esta filípica, terminada con marcado tono de ironía y\r\n     harto impertinente toda ella, no agradó al joven; pero se\r\n     abstuvo de manifestar el más ligero disgusto y siguió la\r\n     conversación, procurando en lo posible huir de los puntos\r\n[30] en que el susceptible patriotismo del señor canónigo hallase\r\n     fácil motivo de discordia. Éste se levantó en el momento\r\n     en que la señora hablaba con su sobrino de asuntos de\r\n     familia y dió algunos pasos por la estancia.\r\n\r\n     Era ésta vasta y clara, cubierta de antiguo papel, cuyas\r\n     flores y ramos, aunque descoloridos, conservaban su             32\r\n     primitivo dibujo, gracias al aseo que reinaba en todas y cada una\r\n     de las partes de la vivienda. El reloj, de cuya caja colgaban\r\n     al descubierto, al parecer, las inmóviles pesas y el voluble\r\n[5]  péndulo, diciendo perpetuamente que _no_, ocupaba con su\r\n     abigarrado horario el lugar preeminente entre los sólidos\r\n     muebles del comedor, completando el ornato de las paredes\r\n     una serie de láminas francesas que representaban las hazañas\r\n     del conquistador de Méjico, con prolijas explicaciones al\r\n[10] pie, en las cuales se hablaba de un _Ferdinand Cortez_ y de\r\n     una _Donna Marine_ tan inverosímiles como las figuras\r\n     dibujadas por el ignorante artista. Entre las dos puertas\r\n     vidrieras que comunicaban con la huerta había un aparato de\r\n     latón, que no es preciso describir desde que se diga que\r\n[15] servía de sustentáculo a un loro, el cual se mantenía allí con\r\n     la seriedad y circunspección propias de estos animalejos,\r\n     observándolo todo. La fisonomía irónica y dura de los\r\n     loros, su casaca verde, su gorrete encarnado, sus botas\r\n     amarillas y por último las roncas palabras burlescas que\r\n[20] suelen pronunciar, les dan un aspecto extraño y repulsivo\r\n     entre serio y ridículo. Tienen no sé qué rígido empaque\r\n     de diplomáticos. A veces parecen bufones, y siempre se\r\n     asemejan a ciertos finchados hombres, que por querer\r\n     parecer muy superiores, tiran a la caricatura.\r\n\r\n[25] Era el Penitenciario muy amigo del loro. Cuando dejó\r\n     a la señora y a Rosario en coloquio con el viajero, llegóse\r\n     a él, y dejándose morder con la mayor complacencia el\r\n     dedo índice, le dijo:\r\n\r\n     --Tunante, bribón, ¿por qué no hablas? Poco valdrías,\r\n[30] si no fueras charlatán. De charlatanes está lleno el mundo\r\n     de los hombres y el de los pájaros.\r\n\r\n     Luego cogió con su propia venerable mano algunos garbanzos\r\n     del cercano cazuelillo y se los dió a comer. El\r\n     animal empezó a llamar a la criada pidiéndole chocolate, y\r\n     sus palabras distrajeron a las dos damas y al caballero de     33\r\n     una conversación que no debía de ser muy importante.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n             =Donde se ve que puede surgir la desavenencia\r\n                        cuando menos se espera=\r\n\r\n     De súbito se presentó el Sr. D. Cayetano Polentinos,\r\n     hermano político de doña Perfecta, el cual entró con los\r\n[5]  brazos abiertos, gritando:\r\n\r\n     --Venga acá, Sr. D. José de mi alma.\r\n\r\n     Y se abrazaron cordialmente. D. Cayetano y Pepe se\r\n     conocían, porque el distinguido erudito y bibliófilo solía\r\n     hacer excursiones a Madrid cuando se anunciaba almoneda\r\n[10] de libros, procedente de la testamentaría de algún _buquinista_.\r\n     Era D. Cayetano alto y flaco, de edad mediana, si bien el\r\n     continuo estudio o los padecimientos le habían desmejorado\r\n     mucho; se expresaba con una corrección alambicada que le\r\n     sentaba a las mil maravillas, y era cariñoso y amable, a\r\n[15] veces con exageración. Respecto de su vasto saber, ¿qué\r\n     puede decirse sino que era un verdadero prodigio? En\r\n     Madrid su nombre no se pronunciaba sin respeto, y si D.\r\n     Cayetano residiera en la capital, no se escapara sin\r\n     pertenecer, a pesar de su modestia, a todas las academias\r\n[20] existentes y por existir. Pero él gustaba del tranquilo\r\n                                                    [aislamiento,]\r\n     y el lugar que en el alma de otros tiene la vanidad, teníalo\r\n     en el suyo la pasión pura de los libros, el amor al estudio\r\n     solitario y recogido, sin otra ulterior mira y aliciente que los\r\n     propios libros y el estudio mismo.\r\n\r\n[25] Había formada en Orbajosa una de las más ricas\r\n     bibliotecas que en toda la redondez de España se encuentran, y\r\n     dentro de ella pasaba largas horas del día y de la noche,\r\n     compilando, clasificando, tomando apuntes y entresacando\r\n     diversas suertes de noticias preciosísimas, o realizando        34\r\n     quizás algún inaudito y jamás soñado trabajo, digno de tan\r\n     gran cabeza. Sus costumbres eran patriarcales; comía\r\n     poco, bebía menos, y sus únicas calaveradas consistían en\r\n[5]  alguna merienda en los Alamillos, en días muy sonados, y\r\n     paseos diarios a un lugar llamado Mundogrande, donde a\r\n     menudo eran desenterradas del fango de veinte siglos\r\n     medallas romanas y pedazos de arquitrabe, extraños plintos de\r\n     desconocida arquitectura y tal cual ánfora o cubicularia\r\n[10] de inestimable precio.\r\n\r\n     Vivían D. Cayetano y doña Perfecta en una armonía tal,\r\n     que la paz del Paraíso no se le igualara. Jamás riñeron.\r\n     Es verdad que él no se mezclaba para nada en los asuntos\r\n     de la casa, ni ella en los de la biblioteca más que para\r\n[15] hacerla barrer y limpiar todos los sábados, respetando con\r\n     religiosa admiración los libros y papeles que sobre la mesa\r\n     y en diversos parajes estaban de servicio.\r\n\r\n     Después de las preguntas y respuestas propias del caso,\r\n     D. Cayetano dijo:\r\n\r\n[20] --Ya he visto la caja. Siento mucho que no me trajeras\r\n     la edición de 1527. Tendré que hacer yo mismo un viaje a\r\n     Madrid.... ¿Vas a estar aquí mucho tiempo? Mientras\r\n     más, mejor, querido Pepe. ¡Cuánto me alegro de tenerte\r\n     aquí! Entre los dos vamos a arreglar parte de mi biblioteca\r\n[25] y a hacer un índice de escritores de la Gineta. No\r\n     siempre se encuentra a mano un hombre de tanto talento como\r\n     tú.... Verás mi biblioteca.... Podrás darte en ella unos\r\n     atracones de lectura.... Todo lo que quieras.... Verás\r\n     maravillas, verdaderas maravillas, tesoros inapreciables,\r\n[30] rarezas que sólo yo poseo, sólo yo.... Pero, en fin, me parece\r\n     que ya es hora de comer, ¿no es verdad, José? ¿No es verdad,\r\n     Perfecta? ¿No es verdad, Rosarito? ¿No es verdad, Sr.\r\n     D. Inocencio?... hoy es usted dos veces Penitenciario:\r\n     dígolo porque nos acompañará usted a hacer penitencia.\r\n     El canónigo se inclinó, y sonriendo mostraba                    35\r\n     simpáticamente su aquiescencia. La comida fué cordial, y en todos\r\n     los manjares se advertía la abundancia desproporcionada de\r\n     los banquetes de pueblo, realizada a costa de la variedad.\r\n[5]  Había para atracarse doble número de personas que las allí\r\n     reunidas. La conversación recayó en asuntos diversos.\r\n\r\n     --Es preciso que visite usted cuanto antes nuestra\r\n     catedral--dijo el canónigo.--¡Como ésta hay pocas, Sr.\r\n     D. José!... Verdad es que usted, que tantas maravillas\r\n[10] ha visto en el extranjero, no encontrará nada notable en\r\n     nuestra vieja iglesia.... Nosotros los pobres patanes de\r\n     Orbajosa la encontramos divina. El maestro López de\r\n     Berganza, racionero de ella, la llamaba en el siglo XVI\r\n     _pulchra augustina_.... Sin embargo, para hombres de tanto\r\n[15] saber como usted, quizá no tenga ningún mérito, y cualquier\r\n     mercado de hierro será más bello.\r\n\r\n     Cada vez disgustaba más a Pepe Rey el lenguaje irónico\r\n     del sagaz canónigo; pero resuelto a contener y disimular\r\n     su enfado, no contestó sino con palabras vagas. Doña Perfecta\r\n[20] tomó en seguida la palabra, y jovialmente se expresó\r\n     así:\r\n\r\n     --Cuidado, Pepito; te advierto que si hablas mal de\r\n     nuestra santa iglesia, perderemos las amistades. Tú sabes\r\n     mucho y eres un hombre eminente que de todo entiendes;\r\n[25] pero si has de descubrir que esa gran fábrica no es la octava\r\n     maravilla, guárdate en buen hora tu sabiduría y no nos saques\r\n     de bobos....\r\n\r\n     --Lejos de creer que este edificio no es bello--repuso\r\n     Pepe--lo poco que de su exterior he visto me ha parecido\r\n[30] de imponente hermosura. De modo, señora tía, que no hay\r\n     para qué asustarse; ni yo soy sabio ni mucho menos.\r\n\r\n     --Poco a poco--dijo el canónigo, extendiendo la mano\r\n     y dando paz a la boca por breve rato para que, hablando,\r\n     descansase del mascar.--Alto allá: no venga usted aquí\r\n     haciéndose el modesto, Sr. D. José, que hartos estamos de       36\r\n     saber lo muchísimo que usted vale, la gran fama de que\r\n     goza y el papel importantísimo que desempeñará donde\r\n     quiera que se presente. No se ven hombres así todos los\r\n[5]  días. Pero ya que de este modo ensalzo los méritos de\r\n     usted....\r\n\r\n     Detúvose para seguir comiendo, y luego que la sin hueso\r\n     quedó libre, continuó así:\r\n\r\n     --Ya que de este modo ensalzo los méritos de usted,\r\n[10] permítaseme expresar otra opinión con la franqueza que es\r\n     propia de mi carácter. Sí, Sr. D. José: sí, Sr. D. Cayetano;\r\n     sí, señora y niña mías; la ciencia, tal como la estudian y la\r\n     propagan los modernos, es la muerte del sentimiento y de\r\n     las dulces ilusiones. Con ella la vida del espíritu se amengua;\r\n[15] todo se reduce a reglas fijas, y los mismos encantos\r\n     sublimes de la Naturaleza desaparecen. Con la ciencia\r\n     destrúyese lo maravilloso en las artes, así como la fe en el\r\n     alma. La ciencia dice que todo es mentira y todo lo quiere\r\n     poner en guarismos y rayas, no sólo _maria ac terras_, donde\r\n[20] estamos nosotros, sino también _caelumque profundum_, donde\r\n     está Dios... Los admirables sueños del alma, su arrobamiento\r\n     místico; la inspiración misma de los poetas, mentira.\r\n     El corazón es una esponja, el cerebro una gusanera.\r\n\r\n     Todos rompieron a reír, mientras él daba paso a un trago\r\n[25] de vino.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, ¿me negará el Sr. D. José--añadió el sacerdote--que\r\n     la ciencia, tal como se enseña y se propaga hoy,\r\n     va derecho a hacer del mundo y del género humano una\r\n     gran máquina?\r\n\r\n[30] --Eso según y conforme--dijo D. Cayetano.--Todas\r\n     las cosas tienen su pro y su contra.\r\n\r\n     --Tome usted más ensalada, señor Penitenciario--dijo\r\n     doña Perfecta.--Está cargadita de mostaza, como a usted\r\n     le gusta.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey no gustaba de entablar vanas disputas, ni era          37\r\n     pedante, ni alardeaba de erudito, mucho menos ante mujeres\r\n     y en reuniones de confianza; pero la importuna verbosidad\r\n     agresiva del canónigo necesitaba, según él, un correctivo.\r\n[5]  Para dárselo le pareció mal sistema exponer ideas que,\r\n     concordando con las del canónigo, halagasen a éste, y decidió\r\n     manifestar las opiniones que más contrariaran y más\r\n     acerbamente mortificasen al mordaz Penitenciario.\r\n\r\n     --Quieres divertirte conmigo--dijo para sí.--Verás\r\n[10] qué mal rato te voy a dar.\r\n\r\n     Y luego añadió en voz alta:\r\n\r\n     --Cierto es todo lo que el señor Penitenciario ha dicho\r\n     en tono de broma. Pero no es culpa nuestra que la ciencia\r\n     esté derribando a martillazos un día y otro tanto ídolo vano,\r\n[15] la superstición, el sofisma, las mil mentiras de lo pasado,\r\n     bellas las unas, ridículas las otras, pues de todo hay en la\r\n     viña del Señor. El mundo de las ilusiones, que es como si\r\n     dijéramos un segundo mundo, se viene abajo con estrépito.\r\n     El misticismo en religión, la rutina en la ciencia, el\r\n[20] amaneramiento en las artes, caen como cayeron los dioses paganos,\r\n     entre burlas. Adiós, sueños torpes, el género humano\r\n     despierta y sus ojos ven la claridad. El sentimentalismo vano,\r\n     el misticismo, la fiebre, la alucinación, el delirio desaparecen,\r\n     y el que antes era enfermo hoy está sano y se goza con\r\n[25] placer indecible en la justa apreciación de las cosas. La\r\n     fantasía, la terrible loca, que era el ama de la casa, pasa a\r\n     ser criada.... Dirija usted la vista a todos lados, señor\r\n     Penitenciario, y verá el admirable conjunto de realidad que\r\n     ha sustituído a la fábula. El cielo no es una bóveda, las\r\n[30] estrellas no son farolillos, la luna no es una cazadora\r\n     traviesa, sino un pedrusco opaco; el sol no es un cochero\r\n     emperegilado y vagabundo, sino un incendio fijo. Las\r\n     sirtes no son ninfas, sino dos escollos; las sirenas son\r\n     focas, y en el orden de las personas Mercurio es Manzanedo;\r\n     Marte es un viejo barbilampiño, el conde de Moltke;             38\r\n     Néstor puede ser un señor de gabán que se llama monsieur\r\n     Thiers; Orfeo es Verdi; Vulcano es Krupp; Apolo es\r\n     cualquier poeta. ¿Quiere usted más? Pues Júpiter, un\r\n[5]  Dios digno de ir a presidio si viviera aún, no descarga el\r\n     rayo, sino que el rayo cae cuando a la electricidad le da la\r\n     gana. No hay Parnaso, no hay Olimpo; no hay laguna\r\n     Estigia, ni otros Campos Elíseos que los de París. No hay\r\n     ya más bajada al infierno que las de la geología, y este\r\n[10] viajero, siempre que vuelve, dice que no hay condenados en el\r\n     centro de la tierra. No hay más subidas al cielo que las de\r\n     la astronomía, y ésta a su regreso asegura no haber visto los\r\n     seis o siete pisos de que hablan el Dante y los místicos y\r\n     soñadores de la Edad Media. No encuentra sino astros\r\n[15] y distancias, líneas, enormidades de espacio y nada más.\r\n     Ya no hay falsos cómputos de la edad del mundo, porque\r\n     la paleontología y la prehistoria han contado los dientes de\r\n     esta calavera en que vivimos y averiguado su verdadera\r\n     edad. La fábula, llámese paganismo o idealismo cristiano,\r\n[20] ya no existe, y la imaginación está de cuerpo presente.\r\n     Todos los milagros posibles se reducen a los que yo hago\r\n     cuando se me antoja en mi gabinete con una pila de\r\n     Bunsen, un hilo inductor y una aguja imantada. Ya no hay\r\n     más multiplicaciones de panes y peces que las que hace la\r\n[25] industria con sus moldes y máquinas y las de la imprenta,\r\n     que imita a la Naturaleza sacando de un solo tipo millones\r\n     de ejemplares. En suma, señor canónigo de mi alma, se\r\n     han corrido las órdenes para dejar cesantes a todos los\r\n     absurdos, falsedades, ilusiones, ensueños, sensiblerías y\r\n[30] preocupaciones que ofuscan el entendimiento del hombre.\r\n     Celebremos el suceso.\r\n\r\n     Cuando concluyó de hablar, en los labios del canónigo\r\n     retozaba una sonrisilla, y sus ojos habían tomado animación\r\n     extraordinaria. D. Cayetano se ocupaba en dar diversas\r\n     formas, ora romboides, ora prismáticas, a una bolita de pan.    39\r\n     Pero doña Perfecta estaba pálida y fijaba sus ojos en el\r\n     canónigo con insistencia observadora. Rosarito\r\n     contemplaba llena de estupor a su primo. Éste se inclinó hacia\r\n[5]  ella, y al oído le dijo disimuladamente en voz muy baja:\r\n\r\n     --No me hagas caso, primita. Digo estos disparates\r\n     para sulfurar al señor canónigo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VII\r\n\r\n                         =La desavenencia crece=\r\n\r\n     --Puede que creas--indicó doña Perfecta con ligero\r\n     acento de vanidad,--que el señor D. Inocencio se va a\r\n[10] quedar callado sin contestarte a todos y cada uno de esos\r\n     puntos.\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh, no!--exclamó el canónigo, arqueando las cejas.\r\n\r\n     --No mediré yo mis escasas fuerzas con adalid tan valiente\r\n     y al mismo tiempo tan bien armado. El Sr. D. José lo\r\n[15] sabe todo, es decir, tiene a su disposición todo el arsenal\r\n     de las ciencias exactas. Bien sé que la doctrina que\r\n     sustenta es falsa; pero yo no tengo talento ni elocuencia para\r\n     combatirla. Emplearía yo las armas del sentimiento; emplearía\r\n     argumentos teológicos, sacados de la revelación, de\r\n[20] la fe, de la palabra divina; pero ¡ay! el Sr. D. José, que\r\n     es un sabio eminente, se reiría de la teología, de la fe, de\r\n     la revelación, de los santos profetas, del Evangelio. Un\r\n     pobre clérigo ignorante, un desdichado que no sabe matemáticas,\r\n     ni filosofía alemana en que hay aquello de _yo_ y _no\r\n[25] yo,_ un pobre dómine que no sabe más que la ciencia de Dios\r\n     y algo de poetas latinos, no puede entrar en combate con\r\n     estos bravos corifeos.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey prorrumpió en francas risas.\r\n\r\n     --Veo que el Sr. D. Inocencio--dijo,--ha tomado\r\n[30] por lo serio estas majaderías que he dicho. Vaya, señor\r\n     canónigo, vuélvanse cañas las lanzas y todo se acabó.           40\r\n     Seguro estoy de que mis verdaderas ideas y las de usted\r\n     no están en desacuerdo. Usted es un varón piadoso e\r\n[5]  instruído. Aquí el ignorante soy yo. Si he querido\r\n     bromear, dispénsenme todos: yo soy así.\r\n\r\n     --Gracias--repuso el presbítero visiblemente\r\n     contrariado.--¿Ahora salimos con ésa? Bien sé yo, bien\r\n     sabemos todos que las ideas que usted ha sustentado son las\r\n     suyas. No podía ser de otra manera. Usted es el hombre\r\n[10] del siglo. No puede negarse que su entendimiento es prodigioso,\r\n     verdaderamente prodigioso. Mientras usted\r\n     hablaba, yo, lo confieso ingénuamente, al mismo tiempo que en\r\n     mi interior deploraba error tan grande, no podía menos de\r\n     admirar lo sublime de la expresión, la prodigiosa facundia,\r\n[15] el método sorprendente de su raciocinio, la fuerza de los\r\n     argumentos.... ¡Qué cabeza, señora doña Perfecta, qué\r\n     cabeza la de este joven sobrino de usted! Cuando estuve\r\n     en Madrid y me llevaron al Ateneo, confieso que me quedé\r\n     absorto al ver el asombroso ingenio que Dios ha dado a los\r\n[20] ateos y protestantes.\r\n\r\n     --Sr. D. Inocencio--dijo doña Perfecta, mirando\r\n     alternativamente a su sobrino y a su amigo,--creo que usted al\r\n     juzgar a este chico, traspasa los límites de la benevolencia....\r\n     No te enfades, Pepe, ni hagas caso de lo que digo,\r\n[25] porque yo ni soy sabia ni filósofa, ni teóloga; pero me\r\n     parece que el señor D. Inocencio acaba de dar una prueba\r\n     de su gran modestia y caridad cristiana, negándose a\r\n     apabullarte, como podía hacerlo, si hubiese querido.\r\n\r\n     --¡Señora, por Dios!--dijo el eclesiástico.\r\n\r\n[30] --Él es así--añadió la señora.--Siempre haciéndose la\r\n     mosquita muerta.... Y sabe más que los siete doctores.\r\n     ¡Ay, Sr. D. Inocencio, qué bien le sienta a usted el nombre\r\n     que tiene! Pero no se nos venga acá con humildades\r\n     importunas. Si mi sobrino no tiene pretensiones.... Si\r\n     él sabe lo que le han enseñado y nada más.... Si ha             41\r\n     aprendido el error, ¿qué más puede desear sino que usted\r\n     le ilustre y le saque del infierno de sus falsas doctrinas?\r\n\r\n     --Justamente, no deseo otra cosa, sino que el señor\r\n[5]  Penitenciario me saque....--murmuró Pepe,\r\n     comprendiendo que, sin quererlo, se había metido en un laberinto.\r\n\r\n     --Yo soy un pobre clérigo que no sabe más que la ciencia\r\n     antigua--repuso D. Inocencio.--Reconozco el inmenso\r\n     valor científico mundano del Sr. D. José, y ante tan brillante\r\n[10] oráculo, callo y me postro.\r\n\r\n     Diciendo esto, el canónigo cruzaba ambas manos sobre\r\n     el pecho, inclinando la cabeza. Pepe Rey estaba un si es\r\n     no es turbado a causa del giro que diera su tía a una vana\r\n     disputa festiva en la que tomó parte tan sólo por acalorar\r\n[15] un poco la conversación. Creyó lo más prudente poner\r\n     punto en tan peligroso tratado, y con este fin dirigió una\r\n     pregunta al Sr. D. Cayetano, cuando éste, despertando del\r\n     vaporoso letargo que tras los postres le sobrevino, ofrecía a\r\n     los comensales los indispensables palillos clavados en un\r\n[20] pavo de porcelana que hacía la rueda.\r\n\r\n     --Ayer he descubierto una mano empuñando el asa de un\r\n     ánfora, en la cual hay varios signos hieráticos. Te la\r\n     enseñaré--dijo D. Cayetano, gozoso de plantear un tema de\r\n     su predilección.\r\n\r\n[25] --Supongo que el Sr. de Rey será también muy experto\r\n     en cosas de arqueología--dijo el canónigo que, siempre\r\n     implacable, corría tras su víctima, siguiéndola hasta su más\r\n     escondido refugio.\r\n\r\n     --Por supuesto--dijo doña Perfecta.--¿De qué no\r\n[30] entenderán estos despabilados niños del día? Todas las\r\n     ciencias las llevan en las puntas de los dedos. Las\r\n     universidades y las academias les instruyen de todo en un\r\n     periquete, dándoles patente de sabiduría.\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh! eso es injusto--repuso el canónigo, observando\r\n     la penosa impresión que manifestaba el semblante del            42\r\n     ingeniero.\r\n\r\n     --Mi tía tiene razón--afirmó Pepe.--Hoy aprendemos\r\n     un poco de todo, y salimos de las escuelas con rudimentos\r\n[5]  de diferentes estudios.\r\n\r\n     --Decía--añadió el canónigo,--que será usted un gran\r\n     arqueólogo.\r\n\r\n     --No sé una palabra de esa ciencia--repuso el joven.--Las\r\n     ruinas son ruinas, y nunca me ha gustado empolvarme\r\n[10] en ellas.\r\n\r\n     Don Cayetano hizo una mueca muy expresiva.\r\n\r\n     --No es esto condenar la arqueología--dijo vivamente\r\n     el sobrino de doña Perfecta, advirtiendo con dolor que no\r\n     pronunciaba una palabra sin herir a alguien.--Bien sé que\r\n[15] del polvo sale la historia. Esos estudios son preciosos y\r\n     utilísimos.\r\n\r\n     --Usted--dijo el Penitenciario, metiéndose el palillo en\r\n     la última muela,--se inclinará más a los estudios de\r\n     controversia. Ahora se me ocurre una excelente idea. Sr. D.\r\n[20] José, usted debiera ser abogado.\r\n\r\n     --La abogacía es una profesión que aborrezco--replicó\r\n     Pepe Rey.--Conozco abogados muy respetables, entre ellos\r\n     a mi padre, que es el mejor de los hombres. A pesar de\r\n     tan buen ejemplo, en mi vida me hubiera sometido a ejercer\r\n[25] una profesión que consiste en defender lo mismo el pro que\r\n     el contra de las cuestiones. No conozco error, ni\r\n     preocupación, ni ceguera más grande que el empeño de las familias\r\n     en inclinar a la mejor parte de la juventud a la abogacía.\r\n     La primera y más terrible plaga de España es la turbamulta\r\n[30] de jóvenes abogados, para cuya existencia es necesaria una\r\n     fabulosa cantidad de pleitos. Las cuestiones se multiplican\r\n     en proporción de la demanda. Aun así, muchísimos se\r\n     quedan sin trabajo, y como un señor jurisconsulto no puede\r\n     tomar el arado ni sentarse al telar, de aquí proviene ese\r\n     brillante escuadrón de holgazanes, llenos de pretensiones,      43\r\n     que fomentan la empleomanía, perturban la política, agitan\r\n     la opinión y engendran las revoluciones. De alguna parte\r\n     han de comer. Mayor desgracia sería que hubiera pleitos\r\n[5]  para todos.\r\n\r\n     --Pepe, por Dios, mira lo que hablas--dijo doña Perfecta,\r\n     con marcado tono de severidad.--Pero dispénsele usted,\r\n     Sr. D. Inocencio... porque él ignora que usted tiene un\r\n     sobrinito, el cual, aunque recién salido de la Universidad,\r\n[10] es un portento en la abogacía.\r\n\r\n     --Yo hablo en términos generales--manifestó Pepe con\r\n     firmeza.--Siendo, como soy, hijo de un abogado ilustre, no\r\n     puedo desconocer que algunas personas ejercen esta noble\r\n     profesión con verdadera gloria.\r\n\r\n[15] --No... si mi sobrino es un chiquillo todavía--dijo\r\n     el canónigo, afectando humildad.--Muy lejos de mi ánimo\r\n     afirmar que es un prodigio de saber, como el Sr. de Rey.\r\n     Con el tiempo ¿quién sabe?... Su talento no es brillante\r\n     ni seductor. Por supuesto, las ideas de Jacintito son\r\n[20] sólidas, su criterio sano; lo que sabe lo sabe a macha\r\n     martillo. No conoce sofisterías ni palabras huecas....\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey aparecía cada vez más inquieto. La idea de\r\n     que, sin quererlo, estaba en contradicción con las ideas\r\n     de los amigos de su tía, le mortificaba, y resolvió callar por\r\n[25] temor a que él y D. Inocencio concluyeran tirándose los\r\n     platos a la cabeza. Felizmente, el esquilón de la catedral,\r\n     llamando a los canónigos a la importante tarea del coro, le\r\n     sacó de situación tan penosa. Levantóse el venerable\r\n     varón y se despidió de todos, mostrándose con Pepe tan\r\n[30] lisonjero, tan amable, cual si la amistad más íntima desde\r\n     largo tiempo les uniera. El canónigo, después de ofrecerse\r\n     a él para servirle en todo, le prometió presentarle a su\r\n     sobrino, a fin de que le acompañase a ver la población, y le\r\n     dijo las expresiones más cariñosas, dignándose agraciarle al\r\n     salir con una palmadita en el hombro. Pepe Rey, aceptando       44\r\n     con gozo aquellas fórmulas de concordia, vió, sin embargo,\r\n     el cielo abierto cuando el sacerdote salió del comedor y de\r\n     la casa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n\r\n                             =A toda prisa=\r\n\r\n[5]  Poco después la escena había cambiado. Don Cayetano,\r\n     encontrando descanso a sus sublimes tareas en un dulce\r\n     sueño que de él se amparó, yacía blandamente en un sillón\r\n     del comedor. Doña Perfecta andaba en la casa tras sus\r\n     quehaceres. Rosarito, sentándose junto a una de las\r\n[10] vidrieras que a la huerta se abrían, miró a su primo, diciéndole\r\n     con la muda oratoria de los ojos:\r\n\r\n     --Primo, siéntate aquí junto a mí, y dime todo eso que\r\n     tienes que decirme.\r\n\r\n     Éste, aunque matemático, lo comprendió.\r\n\r\n[15] --Querida prima--dijo Pepe,--¡cuánto te habrás aburrido\r\n     hoy con nuestras disputas! Bien sabe Dios que por\r\n     mi gusto no habría pedanteado como viste; pero el señor\r\n     canónigo tiene la culpa.... ¿Sabes que me parece singular\r\n     ese señor sacerdote?...\r\n\r\n[20] --¡Es una persona excelente!--repuso Rosarito,\r\n     demostrando el gozo que sentía por verse en disposición de dar\r\n     a su primo todos los datos y noticias que necesitase.\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh! sí, una excelente persona. ¡Bien se conoce!\r\n\r\n     --Cuando le sigas tratando, conocerás....\r\n\r\n[25] --Que no tiene precio. En fin, basta que sea amigo de\r\n     tu mamá y tuyo para que también lo sea mío--afirmó el\r\n     joven.--¿Y viene mucho acá?\r\n\r\n     --Toditos los días. Nos acompaña mucho--- repuso\r\n     Rosarito con ingenuidad.--¡Qué bueno y qué amable es!\r\n[30] ¡Y cómo me quiere!\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, ya me va gustando ese señor.                           45\r\n\r\n     --Viene también por las noches a jugar al tresillo--añadió\r\n     la joven,--porque a prima noche se reunen aquí algunas\r\n     personas, el juez de primera instancia, el promotor fiscal,\r\n[5]  el deán, el secretario del obispo, el alcalde, el recaudador\r\n     de contribuciones, el sobrino de D. Inocencio....\r\n\r\n     --¡Ah! Jacintito, el abogado.\r\n\r\n     --Ése. Es un pobre muchacho, más bueno que el pan.\r\n     Su tío le adora. Desde que vino de la Universidad, con su\r\n[10] borla de doctor... porque es doctor de un par de\r\n     facultades, y sacó nota de sobresaliente... ¿qué crees tú?\r\n     ¡vaya!... pues desde que vino, su tío le trae aquí con\r\n     mucha frecuencia. Mamá también le quiere mucho....\r\n     Es un muchacho muy formalito. Se retira temprano con\r\n[15] su tío; no va nunca al Casino por las noches, no juega ni\r\n     derrocha, y trabaja en el bufete de D. Lorenzo Ruiz, que\r\n     es el primer abogado de Orbajosa. Dicen que Jacinto será\r\n     un gran defensor de pleitos.\r\n\r\n     --Su tío no exageraba al elogiarle--dijo Pepe.--Siento\r\n[20] mucho haber dicho aquellas tonterías sobre los abogados....\r\n     Querida prima, ¿no es verdad que estuve inconveniente?\r\n\r\n     --Calla, si a mí me parece que tienes mucha razón.\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero de veras, no estuve un poco?\r\n\r\n     --Nada, nada.\r\n\r\n[25] --¡Qué peso me quitas de encima! La verdad es que\r\n     me encontré, sin saber cómo, en una contradicción constante\r\n     y penosa con ese venerable sacerdote. Lo siento mucho.\r\n\r\n     --Lo que yo creo--dijo Rosarito, clavando en él sus\r\n     ojos llenos de expresión cariñosa,--es que tú no eres para\r\n[30] nosotros.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué significa eso?\r\n\r\n     --No sé si me explico bien, primo. Quiero decir que no\r\n     es fácil te acostumbres a la conversación ni a las ideas de\r\n     la gente de Orbajosa. Se me figura... es una suposición.\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh! no: yo creo que te equivocas.                            46\r\n\r\n     --Tú vienes de otra parte, de otro mundo, donde las\r\n     personas son muy listas, muy sabias, y tienen unas maneras\r\n     finas y un modo de hablar ingenioso, y una figura...\r\n[5]  puede ser que no me explique bien. Quiero decir que\r\n     estás habituado a vivir entre una sociedad escogida; sabes\r\n     mucho... Aquí no hay lo que tú necesitas; aquí no hay\r\n     gente sabia, ni grandes finuras. Todo es sencillez, Pepe.\r\n     Se me figura que te aburrirás, que te aburrirás mucho, y al\r\n[10] fin tendrás que marcharte.\r\n\r\n     La tristeza, que era normal en el semblante de Rosarito,\r\n     se mostró con tintas y rasgos tan notorios, que Pepe Rey\r\n     sintió una emoción profunda.\r\n\r\n     --Estás en un error, querida prima. Ni yo traigo aquí\r\n[15] la idea que supones, ni mi carácter ni mi entendimiento\r\n     están en disonancia con los caracteres y las ideas de aquí.\r\n     Pero vamos a suponer por un momento que lo estuvieran.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos a suponerlo....\r\n\r\n     --En ese caso, tengo la firme convicción de que entre tú\r\n[20] y yo, entre nosotros dos, querida Rosario, se establecerá\r\n     una armonía perfecta. Sobre esto no puedo engañarme.\r\n     El corazón me dice que no me engaño.\r\n\r\n     Rosarito se ruborizó; pero esforzándose en hacer huir\r\n     su sonrojo con sonrisas y miradas dirigidas aquí y allí, dijo:\r\n\r\n[25] --No vengas ahora con artificios. Si lo dices porque yo\r\n     he de encontrar siempre bien todo lo que digas, tienes\r\n     razón.\r\n\r\n     --Rosario--exclamó el joven.--Desde que te vi, mi\r\n     alma se sintió llena de una alegría muy viva... he sentido\r\n[30] al mismo tiempo un pesar, el de no haber venido antes a\r\n     Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     --Eso sí que no lo he de creer--dijo ella, afectando\r\n     jovialidad para encubrir medianamente su emoción.--¿Tan\r\n     pronto?... No vengas ahora con palabrotas... Mira,\r\n     Pepe, yo soy una lugareña; yo no sé hablar más que cosas        47\r\n     vulgares; yo no sé francés; yo no me visto con elegancia;\r\n     yo apenas sé tocar el piano; yo....\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh, Rosario!--exclamó con ardor el joven.--Dudaba\r\n[5]  que fueses perfecta; ahora ya sé que lo eres.\r\n\r\n     Entró de súbito la madre. Rosarito, que nada tenía que\r\n     contestar a las últimas palabras de su primo, conoció, sin\r\n     embargo, la necesidad de decir algo, y mirando a su madre,\r\n     habló así:\r\n\r\n[10] --¡Ah! se me había olvidado poner la comida al loro.\r\n\r\n     --No te ocupes de eso ahora. ¿Para qué os estáis ahí?\r\n     Lleva a tu primo a dar un paseo por la huerta.\r\n\r\n     La señora se sonreía con bondad maternal, señalando a\r\n     su sobrino la frondosa arboleda que tras los cristales\r\n[15] aparecía.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos allá--dijo Pepe levantándose.\r\n\r\n     Rosarito se lanzó como un pájaro puesto en libertad hacia\r\n     la vidriera.\r\n\r\n     --Pepe, que sabe tanto y ha de entender de árboles--afirmó\r\n[20] doña Perfecta,--te enseñará cómo se hacen los\r\n     ingertos. A ver qué opina él de esos peralitos que se van\r\n     a trasplantar.\r\n\r\n     --Ven, ven--dijo Rosarito desde fuera.\r\n\r\n     Llamaba a su primo con impaciencia. Ambos desaparecieron\r\n[25] entre el follaje. Doña Perfecta les vió alejarse, y\r\n     después se ocupó del loro. Mientras le renovaba la comida,\r\n     dijo en voz muy baja, con ademán pensativo:\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué despegado es! Ni siquiera le ha hecho una\r\n     caricia al pobre animalito.\r\n\r\n[30] Luego en voz alta añadió, creyendo en la posibilidad de\r\n     ser oída por su cuñado:\r\n\r\n     --Cayetano, ¿qué te parece el sobrino?... ¡Cayetano!\r\n\r\n     Sordo gruñido indicó que el anticuario volvía al conocimiento\r\n     de este miserable mundo.\r\n\r\n     --Cayetano....                                                  48\r\n\r\n     --Eso es... eso es...--murmuró con torpe voz el\r\n     sabio,--ese caballerito sostendrá como todos la opinión\r\n     errónea de que las estatuas de Mundogrande proceden de\r\n[5]  la primera inmigración fenicia. Yo le convenceré....\r\n\r\n     --Pero Cayetano....\r\n\r\n     --Pero Perfecta.... ¡Bah! ¿También ahora\r\n     sostendrás que he dormido?\r\n\r\n     --No, hombre, ¡qué he de sostener yo tal desatino!...\r\n[10] ¿Pero no me dices qué te parece ese joven?\r\n\r\n     Don Cayetano se puso la palma de la mano ante la boca\r\n     para bostezar más a gusto, y después entabló una larga\r\n     conversación con la señora. Los que nos han transmitido\r\n     las noticias necesarias a la composición de esta historia,\r\n[15] pasan por alto aquel diálogo, sin duda porque fué demasiado\r\n     secreto. En cuanto a lo que hablaron el ingeniero y\r\n     Rosarito en la huerta aquella tarde, parece evidente que no es\r\n     digno de mención.\r\n\r\n     En la tarde del siguiente día ocurrieron, sí, cosas que no\r\n[20] deben pasarse en silencio, por ser de la mayor gravedad.\r\n     Hallábanse solos ambos primos a hora bastante avanzada\r\n     de la tarde, después de haber discurrido por distintos\r\n     parajes de la huerta, atentos el uno al otro y sin tener alma\r\n     ni sentidos más que para verse y oírse.\r\n\r\n[25] --Pepe--decía Rosario,--todo lo que me has dicho es\r\n     una fantasía, una cantinela de esas que tan bien sabéis\r\n     hacer los hombres de chispa. Tú piensas que, como soy\r\n     lugareña, creo cuanto me dicen.\r\n\r\n     --Si me conocieras, como yo creo conocerte a ti, sabrías\r\n[30] que jamás digo sino lo que siento. Pero dejémonos de\r\n     sutilezas tontas y de argucias de amantes que no conducen\r\n     sino a falsear los sentimientos. Yo no hablaré contigo más\r\n     lenguaje que el de la verdad. ¿Eres acaso una señorita\r\n     a quien he conocido en el paseo o en la tertulia y con la\r\n     cual pienso pasar un rato divertido? No. Eres mi prima.         49\r\n     Eres algo más.... Rosario, pongamos de una vez las\r\n     cosas en su verdadero lugar. Fuera rodeos. Yo he venido\r\n     aquí a casarme contigo.\r\n\r\n[5]  Rosario sintió que su rostro se abrasaba y el corazón no\r\n     le cabía en el pecho.\r\n\r\n     --Mira, querida prima--añadió el joven,--te juro que\r\n     si no me hubieras gustado, ya estaría lejos de aquí.\r\n     Aunque la cortesía y la delicadeza me habrían obligado a hacer\r\n[10] esfuerzos, no me hubiera sido fácil disimular mi desengaño.\r\n     Yo soy así.\r\n\r\n     --Primo, casi acabas de llegar--dijo lacónicamente\r\n     Rosarito, esforzándose en reír.\r\n\r\n     --Acabo de llegar y ya sé todo lo que tenía que saber;\r\n[15] sé que te quiero; que eres la mujer que desde hace tiempo\r\n     me está anunciando el corazón, diciéndome noche y día...\r\n     \"ya viene, ya está cerca; que te quemas.\"\r\n\r\n     Esta frase sirvió de pretexto a Rosario para soltar la risa\r\n     que en sus labios retozaba. Su espíritu se desvanecía\r\n[20] alborozado en una atmósfera de júbilo.\r\n\r\n     --Tú te empeñas en que no vales nada--continuó Pepe,--y\r\n     eres una maravilla. Tienes la cualidad admirable de\r\n     estar a todas horas proyectando sobre cuanto te rodea la\r\n     divina luz de tu alma. Desde que se te ve, desde que se te\r\n[25] mira, los nobles sentimientos y la pureza de tu corazón\r\n     se manifiestan. Viéndote, se ve una vida celeste que por\r\n     descuido de Dios está en la tierra; eres un ángel y yo te\r\n     adoro como un tonto.\r\n\r\n     Al decir esto, parecía haber desempeñado una grave\r\n[30] misión. Rosarito vióse de súbito dominada por tan viva\r\n     sensibilidad, que la escasa energía de su cuerpo no pudo\r\n     corresponder a la excitación de su espíritu, y desfalleciendo,\r\n     dejóse caer sobre una piedra que hacía las veces de asiento\r\n     en aquellos amenos lugares. Pepe se inclinó hacia ella.\r\n     Notó que cerraba los ojos, apoyando la frente en la palma       50\r\n     de la mano. Poco después, la hija de doña Perfecta\r\n     Polentinos dirigía a su primo, entre dulces lágrimas, una mirada\r\n     tierna, seguida de estas palabras:\r\n\r\n[5]  --Te quiero desde antes de conocerte.\r\n\r\n     Apoyadas sus manos en las del joven, se levantó, y sus\r\n     cuerpos desaparecieron entre las frondosas ramas de un\r\n     paseo de adelfas. Caía la tarde, y una dulce sombra se\r\n     extendía por la parte baja de la huerta, mientras el último\r\n[10] rayo del sol poniente coronaba de varios resplandores las\r\n     cimas de los árboles. La ruidosa república de pajarillos\r\n     armaba espantosa algarabía en las ramas superiores. Era\r\n     la hora en que, después de corretear por la alegre\r\n     inmensidad de los cielos, iban todos a acostarse, y se disputaban\r\n[15] unos a otros la rama que escogían por alcoba. Su charla\r\n     parecía a veces recriminación y disputa, a veces burla y\r\n     gracejo. Con su parlero trinar se decían aquellos tunantes\r\n     las mayores insolencias, dándose de picotazos y agitando\r\n     las alas, así como los oradores agitan los brazos cuando\r\n[20] quieren hacer creer las mentiras que están diciendo.\r\n     Pero también sonaban por allí palabras de amor, que\r\n     a ello convidaban la apacible hora y el hermoso lugar.\r\n     Un oído experto hubiera podido distinguir las\r\n     siguientes:\r\n\r\n[25] --Desde antes de conocerte te quería, y si no hubieras\r\n     venido me habría muerto de pena. Mamá me daba a leer\r\n     las cartas de tu padre, y como en ellas hacía tantas\r\n     alabanzas de ti, yo decía: \"éste debiera ser mi marido.\"\r\n     Durante mucho tiempo, tu padre no habló de que tú y yo nos\r\n[30] casáramos, lo cual me parecía un descuido muy grande.\r\n     Yo no sabía qué pensar de semejante negligencia.... Mi\r\n     tío Cayetano, siempre que te nombraba, decía: \"Como ése\r\n     hay pocos en el mundo. La mujer que le pesque, ya se\r\n     puede tener por dichosa....\" Por fin tu papá dijo lo que\r\n     no podía menos de decir.... Sí, no podía menos de               51\r\n     decirlo: yo lo esperaba todos los días....\r\n\r\n     Poco después de estas palabras, la misma voz añadió con\r\n     zozobra:\r\n\r\n[5]  --Alguien viene tras de nosotros.\r\n\r\n     Saliendo de entre las adelfas, Pepe vió a dos personas\r\n     que se acercaban, y tocando las hojas de un tierno arbolito\r\n     que allí cerca había, dijo en alta voz a su compañera:\r\n\r\n     --No es conveniente aplicar la primera poda a los árboles\r\n[10] jóvenes como éste hasta su completo arraigo. Los árboles\r\n     recién plantados no tienen vigor para soportar dicha operación.\r\n     Tú bien sabes que las raíces no pueden formarse sino por el\r\n     influjo de las hojas: así es que si le quitas las hojas....\r\n\r\n     --¡Ah! Sr. D. José--exclamó el Penitenciario con\r\n[15] franca risa, acercándose a los dos jóvenes y haciéndoles una\r\n     reverencia.--¿Está usted dando lecciones de horticultura?\r\n     _Insere nunc, Miliboee, piros, pone ordine vitis_, que dijo el gran\r\n     cantor de los trabajos del campo. Ingerta los perales, caro\r\n     Melibeo, arregla las parras.... ¿Con que cómo estamos\r\n[20] de salud, Sr. D. José?\r\n\r\n     El ingeniero y el canónigo se dieron las manos. Luego\r\n     éste volvióse, y señalando a un jovenzuelo que tras él venía,\r\n     dijo sonriendo:\r\n\r\n     --Tengo el gusto de presentar a usted a mi querido\r\n[25] Jacintillo... una buena pieza... un tarambana, Sr. D. José.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\n                    =La desavenencia sigue creciendo\r\n                   y amenaza convertirse en discordia=\r\n\r\n     Junto a la negra sotana se destacó un sonrosado y fresco\r\n     rostro. Jacintito saludó a nuestro joven, no sin cierto\r\n     embarazo.\r\n\r\n     Era uno de esos chiquillos precoces a quienes la indulgente\r\n[30] Universidad lanza antes de tiempo a las arduas luchas del\r\n     mundo, haciéndoles creer que son hombres porque son             52\r\n     doctores. Tenía Jacintito semblante agraciado y carilleno,\r\n     con mejillas de rosa como una muchacha, y era rechoncho\r\n     de cuerpo, de estatura pequeña, tirando un poco a pequeñísima,\r\n[5]  y sin más pelo de barba que el suave bozo que lo\r\n     anunciaba. Su edad excedía poco de los veinte años.\r\n     Habíase educado desde la niñez bajo la dirección de su\r\n     excelente y discreto tío, con lo cual dicho se está que el\r\n     tierno arbolito no se torció al crecer. Una moral severa le\r\n[10] mantenía constantemente derecho, y en el cumplimiento\r\n     de sus deberes escolásticos apenas tenía pero. Concluídos\r\n     los estudios universitarios con aprovechamiento asombroso,\r\n     pues no hubo clase en que no ganase las más eminentes\r\n     notas, empezó a trabajar, prometiendo con su aplicación y\r\n[15] buen tino para la abogacía perpetuar en el foro el lozano\r\n     verdor de los laureles del aula.\r\n\r\n     A veces era travieso como un niño, a veces formal como\r\n     un hombre. En verdad, en verdad, que si a Jacintito no le\r\n     gustaran un poco, y aun un mucho, las lindas muchachas,\r\n[20] su buen tío le creería perfecto. No dejaba de sermonearle\r\n     a todas horas, apresurándose a cortarle los audaces vuelos;\r\n     pero ni aun esta inclinación mundana del jovenzuelo lograba\r\n     enfriar el mucho amor que nuestro buen canónigo tenía al\r\n     encantador retoño de su cara sobrina María Remedios.\r\n[25] En tratándose del abogadillo, todo cedía. Hasta las graves\r\n     y metódicas prácticas del buen sacerdote se alteraban\r\n     siempre que se tratase de algún asunto referente a su\r\n     precoz pupilo. Aquel método riguroso y fijo como un\r\n     sistema planetario, solía perder su equilibrio cuando Jacintito\r\n[30] estaba enfermo o tenía que hacer un viaje. ¡Inútil celibato\r\n     el de los clérigos! Si el Concilio de Trento les prohibe\r\n     tener hijos, Dios, no el Demonio, les da sobrinos para que\r\n     conozcan los dulces afanes de la paternidad.\r\n\r\n     Examinadas imparcialmente las cualidades de aquel aprovechado\r\n     niño, era imposible desconocer que no carecía de                53\r\n     mérito. Su carácter era por lo común inclinado a la honradez,\r\n     y las acciones nobles despertaban franca admiración\r\n     en su alma. Respecto a sus dotes intelectuales y a su saber\r\n[5]  social, tenía todo lo necesario para ser con el tiempo una\r\n     notabilidad de estas que tanto abundan en España; podía\r\n     ser lo que a todas horas nos complacemos en llamar hiperbólicamente\r\n     un _distinguido patricio_ o _un eminente hombre público_,\r\n     especies que por su mucha abundancia apenas son apreciadas\r\n[10] en su justo valor. En aquella tierna edad en que el\r\n     grado universitario sirve de soldadura entre la puericia y la\r\n     virilidad, pocos jóvenes, mayormente cuando han sido mimados\r\n     por sus maestros, están libres de una pedantería fastidiosa,\r\n     que si les da gran prestigio junto al sillón de sus\r\n[15] mamás, es muy risible entre hombres hechos y formales.\r\n     Jacintito tenía este defecto, disculpable no sólo por sus\r\n     pocos años, sino porque su buen tío fomentaba aquella\r\n     vanidad pueril con imprudentes aplausos.\r\n\r\n     Luego que los cuatro se reunieron, continuaron paseando.\r\n[20] Jacinto callaba. El canónigo, volviendo al interrumpido\r\n     tema de los _piros_ que se habían de ingertar y de las _vitis_\r\n     que se debían poner en orden, dijo:\r\n\r\n     --Ya sé que D. José es un gran agrónomo.\r\n\r\n     --Nada de eso; no sé una palabra--repuso el joven,\r\n[25] viendo con mucho disgusto aquella manía de suponerle\r\n     instruido en todas las ciencias.\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh! sí; un gran agrónomo--añadió el Penitenciario;--pero\r\n     en asuntos de agronomía no me citen tratados novísimos.\r\n     Para mí toda esa ciencia, Sr. de Rey, está condensada\r\n[30] en lo que yo llamo la _Biblia del campo_, en las _Geórgicas_\r\n     del inmortal latino. Todo es admirable, desde aquella gran\r\n     sentencia _Nec vero terrae ferre omnes omnia possunt_, es decir,\r\n     que no todas las tierras sirven para todos los árboles, Sr. D.\r\n     José, hasta el minucioso tratado de las abejas, en que el\r\n     poeta explana lo concerniente a estos doctos animalitos, y      54\r\n     define al zángano, diciendo:\r\n\r\n     ......................._Ille horridus alter\r\n     Desidia, latamque trahens inglorius alvum_,\r\n\r\n[5]  de figura horrible y perezosa, arrastrando el innoble vientre\r\n     pesado, Sr. D. José....\r\n\r\n     --Hace usted bien en traducírmelo--dijo Pepe,--porque\r\n     entiendo muy poco el latín.\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh! los hombres del día ¿para qué habían de entretenerse\r\n[10] en estudiar antiguallas?--añadió el canónigo con\r\n     ironía.--Además, en latín sólo han escrito los calzonazos\r\n     como Virgilio, Cicerón y Tito Livio. Yo, sin embargo,\r\n     estoy por lo contrario, y sea testigo mi sobrino, a quien he\r\n     enseñado la sublime lengua. El tunante sabe más que yo.\r\n[15] Lo malo es que con las lecturas modernas lo va olvidando,\r\n     y el mejor día se encontrará que es un ignorante, sin sospecharlo.\r\n     Porque, señor D. José, a mi sobrino le ha dado por\r\n     entretenerse con libros novísimos y teorías extravagantes, y\r\n     todo es Flammarión arriba y abajo, y nada más sino que las\r\n[20] estrellas están llenas de gente. Vamos, se me figura que\r\n     ustedes dos van a hacer buenas migas. Jacinto, ruégale a\r\n     este caballero que te enseñe las matemáticas sublimes, que\r\n     te instruya en lo concerniente a los filósofos alemanes, y ya\r\n     eres un hombre.\r\n\r\n[25] El buen clérigo se reía de sus propias ocurrencias,\r\n     mientras Jacinto, gozoso de ver la conversación en terreno\r\n     tan de su gusto, se excusó con Pepe Rey, y de buenas a\r\n     primeras le descargó esta pregunta:\r\n\r\n     --Dígame el Sr. D. José, ¿qué piensa usted del Darwinismo?\r\n\r\n[30] Sonrió nuestro joven al oír pedantería tan fuera de sazón,\r\n     y de buena gana excitara al joven a seguir por aquella senda\r\n     de infantil vanidad; pero creyendo más prudente no intimar\r\n     mucho con el sobrino ni con el tío, contestó sencillamente:\r\n\r\n     --Yo no puedo pensar nada de las doctrinas de Darwin,           55\r\n     porque apenas las conozco. Los trabajos de mi profesión\r\n     no me han permitido dedicarme a esos estudios.\r\n\r\n     --Ya--dijo el canónigo riendo.--Todo se reduce a que\r\n[5]  descendemos de los monos... Si lo dijera sólo por ciertas\r\n     personas que yo conozco, tendría razón.\r\n\r\n\r\n     --La teoría de la selección natural--añadió enfáticamente\r\n     Jacinto,--dicen que tiene muchos partidarios en Alemania.\r\n\r\n     --No lo dudo--dijo el clérigo.--En Alemania no debe\r\n[10] sentirse que esa teoría sea verdadera, por lo que toca a\r\n     Bismarck.\r\n\r\n     Doña Perfecta y el Sr. D. Cayetano aparecieron frente a\r\n     los cuatro.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué hermosa está la tarde!--dijo la señora.--¿Qué\r\n[15] tal, sobrino, te aburres mucho?...\r\n\r\n     --Nada de eso--repuso el joven.\r\n\r\n     --No me lo niegues. De eso veníamos hablando Cayetano\r\n     y yo. Tú estás aburrido, y te empeñas en disimularlo.\r\n     No todos los jóvenes de estos tiempos tienen la abnegación\r\n[20] de pasar su juventud, como Jacinto, en un pueblo donde no\r\n     hay Teatro Real, ni Bufos, ni bailarinas, ni filósofos, ni ateneos,\r\n     ni papeluchos; ni Congresos, ni otras diversiones y\r\n     pasatiempos.\r\n\r\n     --Yo estoy aquí muy bien--repuso Pepe.--Ahora le\r\n[25] estaba diciendo a Rosario que esta ciudad y esta casa me\r\n     son tan agradables, que me gustaría vivir y morir aquí.\r\n\r\n     Rosario se puso muy encendida y los demás callaron.\r\n     Sentáronse todos en una glorieta, apresurándose Jacinto a\r\n     ocupar el lugar a la izquierda de la señorita.\r\n\r\n[30] --Mira, sobrino, tengo que advertirte una cosa--dijo\r\n     doña Perfecta, con aquella risueña expresión de bondad que\r\n     emanaba de su alma, como de la flor el aroma.--Pero no\r\n     vayas a creer que te reprendo, ni que te doy lecciones: tú\r\n     no eres niño y fácilmente comprenderás mis ideas.\r\n\r\n     --Ríñame usted, querida tía; que sin duda lo mereceré--replicó  56\r\n     Pepe, que ya empezaba a acostumbrarse a las\r\n     bondades de la hermana de su padre.\r\n\r\n     --No, no es más que una advertencia. Estos señores\r\n[5]  verán como tengo razón.\r\n\r\n     Rosarito oía con toda su alma.\r\n\r\n     --Pues no es más--añadió la señora,--sino que cuando\r\n     vuelvas a visitar nuestra hermosa catedral procures estar en\r\n     ella con un poco más de recogimiento.\r\n\r\n[10] --Pues ¿qué he hecho yo?\r\n\r\n     --No extraño que tú mismo no conozcas tu falta--indicó\r\n     la señora con aparente jovialidad.--Es natural; acostumbrado\r\n     a entrar con la mayor desenvoltura en los ateneos,\r\n     clubs, academias y congresos, crees que de la misma manera\r\n[15] se puede entrar en un templo donde está la Divina Majestad.\r\n\r\n     --Pero señora, dispénseme usted--dijo Pepe, con gravedad.--Yo\r\n     he entrado en la catedral con la mayor compostura.\r\n\r\n     --Si no te riño, hombre, si no te riño. No lo tomes así,\r\n[20] porque tendré que callarme. Señores, disculpen ustedes a\r\n     mi sobrino. No es de extrañar un descuidillo, una distracción...\r\n     ¿Cuántos años hace que no pones los pies en\r\n     lugar sagrado?\r\n\r\n     --Señora, yo juro a usted... Pero en fin, mis ideas\r\n[25] religiosas podrán ser lo que se quiera; pero acostumbro\r\n     guardar la mayor compostura dentro de la iglesia.\r\n\r\n     --Lo que yo aseguro... vamos, si te has de ofender,\r\n     no sigo... lo que aseguro es que muchas personas lo\r\n     notaron esta mañana. Notáronlo los señores de González,\r\n[30] doña Robustiana, Serafinita, en fin... con decirte que\r\n     llamaste la atención del señor obispo... Su Ilustrísima\r\n     me dió las quejas esta tarde en casa de mis primas. Díjome\r\n     que no te mandó plantar en la calle porque le dijeron que\r\n     eras sobrino mío.\r\n\r\n     Rosario contemplaba con angustia el rostro de su primo,         57\r\n     procurando adivinar sus contestaciones antes que las diera.\r\n\r\n     --Sin duda me han tomado por otro.\r\n\r\n     --No... no... fuiste tú... Pero no vayas a ofenderte,\r\n[5]  que aquí estamos entre amigos y personas de confianza.\r\n     Fuiste tú, yo misma te vi.\r\n\r\n     --¡Usted!\r\n\r\n     --Justamente. ¿Negarás que te pusiste a examinar las\r\n     pinturas, pasando por un grupo de fieles que estaban oyendo\r\n[10] misa?... Te juro que me distraje de tal modo con tus\r\n     idas y venidas, que... Vamos... es preciso que no lo\r\n     vuelvas a hacer. Luego entraste en la capilla de San Gregorio;\r\n     alzaron en el altar mayor y ni siquiera te volviste\r\n     para hacer una demostración de religiosidad. Después\r\n[15] atravesaste de largo a largo la iglesia, te acercaste al sepulcro\r\n     del Adelantado, pusiste las manos sobre el altar, pasaste\r\n     en seguida otra vez por entre el grupo de los fieles, llamando\r\n     la atención. Todas las muchachas te miraban y tú parecías\r\n     satisfecho de perturbar tan lindamente la devoción y ejemplaridad\r\n[20] de aquella buena gente.\r\n\r\n     --¡Dios mío! ¡Todo lo que he hecho!...--exclamó\r\n     Pepe, entre enojado y risueño.--Soy un monstruo y ni\r\n     siquiera lo sospechaba.\r\n\r\n     --No, bien sé que eres un buen muchacho--dijo doña\r\n[25] Perfecta, observando el semblante afectadamente serio e\r\n     inmutable del canónigo, que parecía tener por cara una\r\n     máscara de cartón.--Pero, hijo, de pensar las cosas a\r\n     manifestarlas así con cierto desparpajo, hay una distancia\r\n     que el hombre prudente y comedido no debe salvar nunca.\r\n[30] Bien sé que tus ideas son... no te enfades; si te enfadas,\r\n     me callo... digo que una cosa es tener ideas religiosas\r\n     y otra manifestarlas... Me guardaré muy bien de vituperarte\r\n     porque creas que no nos crió Dios a su imagen y\r\n     semejanza, sino que descendemos de los micos; ni porque\r\n     niegues la existencia del alma, asegurando que ésta es una      58\r\n     droga como los papelillos de magnesia o de ruibarbo que se\r\n     venden en la botica....\r\n\r\n     --Señora, por Dios...--exclamó Pepe con disgusto.--Veo\r\n[5]  que tengo muy mala reputación en Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     Los demás seguían guardando silencio.\r\n\r\n     --Pues decía que no te vituperaré por esas ideas...\r\n     Además de que no tengo derecho a ello, si me pusiera a\r\n     disputar contigo, tú, con tu talentazo descomunal, me confundirías\r\n[10] mil veces... no, nada de eso. Lo que digo es\r\n     que estos pobres y menguados habitantes de Orbajosa son\r\n     piadosos y buenos cristianos, si bien ninguno de ellos sabe\r\n     filosofía alemana; por lo tanto no debes despreciar públicamente\r\n     sus creencias.\r\n\r\n[15] --Querida tía--dijo el ingeniero con gravedad.--Ni yo\r\n     he despreciado las creencias de nadie, ni yo tengo las ideas\r\n     que usted me atribuye. Quizás haya estado un poco irrespetuoso\r\n     en la iglesia; soy algo distraído. Mi entendimiento\r\n     y mi atención estaban fijos en la obra arquitectónica, y\r\n[20] francamente no advertí... pero no era esto motivo para que\r\n     el señor obispo intentase echarme a la calle, y usted me\r\n     supusiera capaz de atribuir a un papelillo de la botica las\r\n     funciones del alma. Puedo tolerar eso como broma, nada\r\n     más que como broma.\r\n\r\n[25] Pepe Rey sentía en su espíritu excitación tan viva, que\r\n     a pesar de su mucha prudencia y mesura no pudo disimularla.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, veo que te has enfadado--dijo doña Perfecta,\r\n     bajando los ojos y cruzando las manos.--¡Todo sea por\r\n[30] Dios! Si hubiera sabido que lo tomabas así, no te habría\r\n     dicho nada. Pepe, te ruego que me perdones.\r\n\r\n     Al oír esto y al ver la actitud sumisa de su bondadosa\r\n     tía, Pepe se sintió avergonzado de la dureza de sus anteriores\r\n     palabras, y procuró serenarse. Sacóle de su embarazosa\r\n     situación el venerable Penitenciario, que sonriendo             59\r\n     con su habitual benevolencia, habló de este modo:\r\n\r\n     --Señora doña Perfecta, es preciso tener tolerancia con\r\n     los artistas... ¡oh! yo he conocido muchos. Estos\r\n[5]  señores, como vean delante de sí una estatua, una armadura\r\n     mohosa, un cuadro podrido o una pared vieja, se olvidan\r\n     de todo. El Sr. D. José es artista, y ha visitado nuestra\r\n     catedral, como la visitan los Ingleses, los cuales de buena\r\n     gana se llevarían a sus museos hasta la última baldosa de\r\n[10] ella... Que estaban los fieles rezando; que el sacerdote\r\n     alzó la Sagrada Hostia; que llegó el instante de la mayor\r\n     piedad y recogimiento; pues bien... ¿qué le importa\r\n     nada de esto a un artista? Es verdad que yo no sé lo que\r\n     vale el arte, cuando se le disgrega de los sentimientos que\r\n[15] expresa... pero en fin, hoy es costumbre adorar la forma,\r\n     no la idea... Líbreme Dios de meterme a discutir este\r\n     tema con el Sr. D. José, que sabe tanto, y argumentando\r\n     con la primorosa sutileza de los modernos, confundiría al\r\n     punto mi espíritu, en el cual no hay más que fe.\r\n\r\n[20] --El empeño de ustedes de considerarme como el hombre\r\n     más sabio de la tierra, me mortifica bastante--dijo Pepe,\r\n     recobrando la dureza de su acento.--Ténganme por tonto;\r\n     que prefiero la fama de necio a poseer esa ciencia de Satanás\r\n     que aquí me atribuyen.\r\n\r\n[25] Rosarito se echó a reír, y Jacinto creyó llegado el momento\r\n     más oportuno para hacer ostentación de su erudita\r\n     personalidad.\r\n\r\n     --El panteísmo o panenteísmo están condenados por la\r\n     Iglesia, así como por las doctrinas de Schopenhauer y el\r\n[30] moderno Hartmann.\r\n\r\n     --Señores y señoras--manifestó gravemente el canónigo,--los\r\n     hombres que consagran culto tan fervoroso al arte,\r\n     aunque sólo sea atendiendo a la forma, merecen el mayor\r\n     respeto. Más vale ser artista y deleitarse ante la belleza,\r\n     aunque sólo esté representada en las ninfas desnudas, que       60\r\n     ser indiferente y descreído en todo. En espíritu que se\r\n     consagra a la contemplación de la belleza no entrará completamente\r\n     el mal. _Est Deus in nobis... Deus_, entiéndase\r\n[5]  bien. Siga, pues, el señor D. José admirando los\r\n     prodigios de nuestra iglesia; que por mi parte le perdonaré\r\n     de buen grado las irreverencias, salva la opinión del señor\r\n     prelado.\r\n\r\n     --Gracias, Sr. D. Inocencio--dijo Pepe, sintiendo en sí\r\n[10] punzante y revoltoso el sentimiento de hostilidad hacia el\r\n     astuto canónigo y no pudiendo dominar el deseo de mortificarle.\r\n     --Por lo demás, no crean ustedes que absorbían mi\r\n     atención las bellezas artísticas de que suponen lleno el\r\n     templo. Esas bellezas, fuera de la imponente arquitectura\r\n[15] de una parte del edificio y de los tres sepulcros que hay en\r\n     las capillas del ábside y de algunos entalles del coro, yo no\r\n     las veo en ninguna parte. Lo que ocupaba mi entendimiento\r\n     era la consideración de la deplorable decadencia de\r\n     las artes religiosas, y no me causaban asombro, sino cólera,\r\n[20] las innumerables monstruosidades artísticas de que está\r\n     llena la catedral.\r\n\r\n     El estupor de los circunstantes fué extraordinario.\r\n\r\n     --No puedo resistir--añadió Pepe,--aquellas imágenes\r\n     charoladas y bermellonadas, tan semejantes, perdóneme\r\n[25] Dios la comparación, a las muñecas con que juegan las\r\n     niñas grandecitas. ¿Qué puedo decir de los vestidos de\r\n     teatro con que las cubren? Vi un San José con manto,\r\n     cuya facha no quiero calificar por respeto al Santo Patriarca\r\n     y a la Iglesia que le adora. En los altares se acumulan\r\n[30] imágenes del más deplorable gusto artístico, y la multitud\r\n     de coronas, ramos, estrellas, lunas y demás adornos de\r\n     metal o papel dorado forman un aspecto de quincallería que\r\n     ofende el sentimiento religioso y hace desmayar nuestro\r\n     espíritu. Lejos de elevarse a la contemplación religiosa, se\r\n     abate, y la idea de lo cómico le perturba. Las grandes          61\r\n     obras del arte, dando formas sensibles a las ideas, a los\r\n     dogmas, a la fe, a la exaltación mística, realizan misión muy\r\n     noble. Los mamarrachos y las aberraciones del gusto, las\r\n[5]  obras grotescas con que una piedad mal entendida llena\r\n     las iglesias, también cumplen su objeto; pero éste es bastante\r\n     triste: fomentan la superstición, enfrían el entusiasmo,\r\n     obligan a los ojos del creyente a apartarse de los altares, y\r\n     con los ojos se apartan las almas que no tienen fe muy profunda\r\n[10] ni muy segura.\r\n\r\n     --La doctrina de los iconoclastas--dijo Jacintito,--también\r\n     parece que está muy extendida en Alemania.\r\n\r\n     --Yo no soy iconoclasta, aunque prefiero la destrucción\r\n     de todas las imágenes a esta exhibición de chocarrerías de\r\n[15] que me ocupo--continuó el joven.--Al ver esto, es lícito\r\n     defender que el culto debe recobrar la sencillez augusta de\r\n     los antiguos tiempos; pero no: no se renuncie al auxilio\r\n     admirable que las artes todas, empezando por la poesía y\r\n     acabando por la música, prestan a las relaciones entre el\r\n[20] hombre y Dios. Vivan las artes, despliéguese la mayor\r\n     pompa en los ritos religiosos. Yo soy partidario de la\r\n     pompa....\r\n\r\n     --Artista, artista y nada más que artista--exclamó el\r\n     canónigo, moviendo la cabeza con expresión de lástima.--Buenas\r\n[25] pinturas, buenas estatuas, bonita música... Gala\r\n     de los sentidos, y el alma que se la lleve el Demonio.\r\n\r\n     --Y a propósito de música--dijo Pepe Rey, sin advertir\r\n     el deplorable efecto que sus palabras producían en la madre\r\n     y la hija,--figúrense ustedes qué dispuesto estaría mi espíritu\r\n[30] a la contemplación religiosa al visitar la catedral, cuando\r\n     de buenas a primeras y al llegar al ofertorio en la misa\r\n     mayor, el señor organista tocó un pasaje de _La Traviata_.\r\n\r\n     --En eso tiene razón el Sr. de Rey--dijo el abogadillo\r\n     enfáticamente.--El señor organista tocó el otro día todo el\r\n     brindis y el wals de la misma ópera y después un rondó de       62\r\n     _La Gran Duquesa_.\r\n\r\n     --Pero cuando se me cayeron las alas del corazón--continuó\r\n     el ingeniero implacablemente,--fué cuando vi\r\n[5]  una imagen de la Virgen que parece estar en gran veneración,\r\n     según la mucha gente que ante ella había y la multitud\r\n     de velas que la alumbraban. La han vestido con ahuecado\r\n     ropón de terciopelo bordado de oro, de tan extraña forma\r\n     que supera a las modas más extravagantes del día. Desaparece\r\n[10] su cara entre un follaje espeso, compuesto de mil\r\n     suertes de encajes rizados con tenacillas, y la corona de\r\n     media vara de alto, rodeada de rayos de oro, es un disforme\r\n     catafalco que le han armado sobre la cabeza. De la misma\r\n     tela y con los mismos bordados son los pantalones del Niño\r\n[15] Jesús... No quiero seguir, porque la descripción de cómo\r\n     están la madre y el hijo me llevaría quizás a cometer alguna\r\n     irreverencia. No diré más, sino que me fué imposible tener\r\n     la risa y que por breve rato contemplé la profanada imagen,\r\n     exclamando: \"¡Madre y señora mía, cómo te han puesto!\"\r\n\r\n[20] Concluídas estas palabras, Pepe observó a sus oyentes, y\r\n     aunque a causa de la sombra crepuscular no se distinguían\r\n     bien los semblantes, creyó ver en alguno de ellos señales de\r\n     amarga consternación.\r\n\r\n     --Pues Sr. D. José--exclamó vivamente el canónigo,\r\n[25] riendo y con expresión de triunfo,--esa imagen que a la\r\n     filosofía y panteísmo de usted parece tan ridícula, es nuestra\r\n     Señora del Socorro, patrona y abogada de Orbajosa, cuyos\r\n     habitantes la veneran de tal modo que serían capaces de\r\n     arrastrar por las calles al que hablase mal de ella. Las\r\n[30] crónicas y la historia, señor mío, están llenas de los milagros\r\n     que ha hecho, y aun hoy día vemos constantemente\r\n     pruebas irrecusables de su protección. Ha de saber usted\r\n     también que su señora tía doña Perfecta es camarera mayor\r\n     de la Santísima Virgen del Socorro, y que ese vestido que\r\n     a usted le parece tan grotesco... pues... digo que ese          63\r\n     vestido tan grotesco a los impíos ojos de usted, salió de\r\n     esta casa, y que los pantalones del Niño obra son juntamente\r\n     de la maravillosa aguja y de la acendrada piedad de\r\n[5]  su prima de usted, Rosarito, que nos está oyendo.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey se quedó bastante desconcertado. En el\r\n     mismo instante levantóse bruscamente doña Perfecta, y sin\r\n     decir una palabra se dirigió hacia la casa, seguida por el\r\n     señor Penitenciario. Levantáronse también los restantes.\r\n[10] Disponíase el aturdido joven a pedir perdón a su prima por\r\n     la irreverencia, cuando observó que Rosarito lloraba. Clavando\r\n     en su primo una mirada de amistosa y dulce reprensión,\r\n     exclamó:\r\n\r\n     --¡Pero qué cosas tienes!\r\n\r\n[15] Oyóse la voz de doña Perfecta que con alterado acento\r\n     gritaba:\r\n\r\n     --¡Rosario, Rosario!\r\n\r\n     Ésta corrió hacia la casa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    X\r\n\r\n               =La existencia de la discordia es evidente=\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey se encontraba turbado y confuso, furioso contra\r\n[20] los demás y contra sí mismo, procurando indagar la causa\r\n     de aquella pugna entablada a pesar suyo entre su pensamiento\r\n     y el pensamiento de los amigos de su tía. Pensativo\r\n     y triste, augurando discordias, permaneció breve rato sentado\r\n     en el banco de la glorieta, con la barba apoyada en el pecho,\r\n[25] fruncido el ceño, cruzadas las manos. Se creía solo.\r\n\r\n     De repente sintió una alegre voz que modulaba entre\r\n     dientes el estribillo de una canción de zarzuela. Miró y\r\n     vio a D. Jacinto en el rincón opuesto de la glorieta.\r\n\r\n     --¡Ah! Sr. de Rey--dijo de improviso el rapaz,--no\r\n[30] se lastiman impunemente los sentimientos religiosos de la\r\n     inmensa mayoría de una nación... Si no, considere usted         64\r\n     lo que pasó en la primera revolución francesa....\r\n\r\n     Cuando Pepe oyó el zumbidillo de aquel insecto, su\r\n     irritación creció. Sin embargo, no había odio en su alma\r\n[5]  contra el mozalvete doctor. Éste le mortificaba como\r\n     mortifican las moscas; pero nada más. Rey sintió la\r\n     molestia que inspiran todos los seres importunos, y como\r\n     quien ahuyenta un zángano, contestó de este modo:\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué tiene que ver la revolución francesa con el manto\r\n[10] de la Virgen María?\r\n\r\n     Levantóse para marchar hacia la casa, pero no había\r\n     dado cuatro pasos, cuando oyó de nuevo el zumbar del\r\n     mosquito que decía:\r\n\r\n     --Sr. D. José, tengo que hablar a usted de un asunto que\r\n[15] le interesa mucho, y que puede traerle algún conflicto....\r\n\r\n     --¿Un asunto?--preguntó el joven retrocediendo.--Veamos\r\n     qué es eso.\r\n\r\n     --Usted lo sospechará tal vez--dijo Jacinto, acercándose\r\n     a Pepe, y sonriendo con expresión parecida a la de los\r\n[20] hombres de negocios, cuando se ocupan de alguno muy\r\n     grave.--Quiero hablar a usted del pleito....\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué pleito?... Amigo mío, yo no tengo pleitos.\r\n     Usted, como buen abogado, sueña con litigios y ve papel\r\n     sellado por todas partes.\r\n\r\n[25] --¿Pero cómo?... ¿No tiene usted noticia de su\r\n     pleito?--exclamó con asombro el niño.\r\n\r\n     --¡De mi pleito!... Cabalmente, yo no tengo pleitos,\r\n     ni los he tenido nunca.\r\n\r\n     --Pues si no tiene usted noticia, más me alegro de habérselo\r\n[30] advertido para que se ponga en guardia... Sí, señor,\r\n     usted pleiteará.\r\n\r\n     --Y ¿con quién?\r\n\r\n     --Con el tío Licurgo y otros colindantes del predio llamado\r\n     los _Alamillos_.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey se quedó estupefacto.                                  65\r\n\r\n     --Sí señor--añadió el abogadillo.--Hoy hemos\r\n     celebrado el Sr. Licurgo y yo una larga conferencia. Como soy\r\n     tan amigo de esta casa, no he querido dejar de advertírselo\r\n[5]  a usted, para que si lo cree conveniente, se apresure a\r\n     arreglarlo todo.\r\n\r\n     --Pero yo ¿qué tengo que arreglar? ¿Qué pretende de\r\n     mí esa canalla?\r\n\r\n     --Parece que unas aguas que nacen en el predio de usted\r\n[10] han variado de curso y caen sobre unos tejares del susodicho\r\n     Licurgo y un molino de otro, ocasionando daños de\r\n     consideración. Mi cliente... porque se ha empeñado en que le\r\n     he de sacar de este mal paso... mi cliente, digo, pretende\r\n     que usted restablezca el antiguo cauce de las aguas, para\r\n[15] evitar nuevos desperfectos y que le indemnice de los\r\n     perjuicios que por indolencia del propietario superior ha sufrido.\r\n\r\n     --¡Y el propietario superior soy yo!... Si entro en\r\n     un litigio, ese será el primer fruto que en toda la vida me\r\n     han dado los célebres Alamillos, que fueron míos, y que\r\n[20] ahora, según entiendo, son de todo el mundo, porque lo\r\n     mismo Licurgo que otros labradores de la comarca, me han\r\n     ido cercenando poco a poco, año tras año, pedazos de\r\n     terreno, y costará mucho restablecer los linderos de mi\r\n     propiedad.\r\n\r\n[25] --Ésa es cuestión aparte.\r\n\r\n     --Ésa no es cuestión aparte. Lo que hay--exclamó el\r\n     ingeniero, sin poder contener su cólera,--es que el\r\n     verdadero pleito será el que yo entable contra tal gentuza, que\r\n     se propone sin duda aburrirme y desesperarme, para que\r\n[30] abandone todo y les deje continuar en posesión de sus\r\n     latrocinios. Veremos si hay abogados y jueces que\r\n     apadrinen los torpes manejos de esos aldeanos legistas, que viven\r\n     pleiteando y son la polilla de la propiedad ajena.\r\n     Caballerito, doy a usted las gracias por haberme advertido los\r\n     ruines propósitos de esos palurdos más malos que Caco.          66\r\n     Con decirle a usted que ese mismo tejar y ese mismo molino\r\n     en que Licurgo apoya sus derechos, son míos....\r\n\r\n     --Debe hacerse una revisión de los títulos de propiedad\r\n[5]  y ver si ha podido haber prescripción en esto--dijo Jacintito.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué prescripción ni qué....! Esos infames no se\r\n     reirán de mí. Supongo que la administración de justicia\r\n     sea honrada y leal en la ciudad de Orbajosa....\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh, lo que es eso!--exclamó el letradillo con\r\n[10] expresión de alabanza. El juez es una persona excelente. Viene\r\n     aquí todas las noches.... Pero es extraño que usted no\r\n     tuviera noticias de las pretensiones del Sr. Licurgo. ¿No le\r\n     han citado aún para el juicio de conciliación?\r\n\r\n     --No.\r\n\r\n[15] --Será mañana.... En fin, yo siento mucho que el\r\n     apresuramiento del Sr. Licurgo me haya privado del gusto\r\n     y de la honra de defenderle a usted, pero como ha de ser....\r\n     Licurgo se ha empeñado en que yo le he de sacar de penas.\r\n     Estudiaré la materia con el mayor detenimiento. Estas\r\n[20] pícaras servidumbres son el gran escollo de la\r\n     jurisprudencia.\r\n\r\n     Pepe entró en el comedor en un estado moral muy\r\n     lamentable. Vió a doña Perfecta hablando con el\r\n     Penitenciario, y a Rosarito sola, con los ojos fijos en la puerta.\r\n[25] Esperaba sin duda a su primo.\r\n\r\n     --Ven acá, buena pieza--dijo la señora, sonriendo con\r\n     muy poca espontaneidad.--Nos has insultado, gran ateo;\r\n     pero te perdonamos. Ya sé que mi hija y yo somos dos\r\n     palurdas incapaces de remontarnos a las regiones de las\r\n[30] matemáticas, donde tú vives; pero en fin... todavía es\r\n     posible que algún día te pongas de rodillas ante nosotros,\r\n     rogándonos que te enseñemos la doctrina.\r\n\r\n     Pepe contestó con frases vagas y fórmulas de cortesía y\r\n     arrepentimiento.\r\n\r\n     --Por mi parte--dijo D. Inocencio, poniendo en los              67\r\n     ojos expresión de modestia y dulzura,--si en el curso de\r\n     estas vanas disputas he dicho algo que pueda ofender al Sr.\r\n     D. José, le ruego que me perdone. Aquí todos somos\r\n[5]  amigos.\r\n\r\n     --Gracias. No vale la pena.\r\n\r\n     --A pesar de todo--indicó doña Perfecta, sonriendo ya\r\n     con más naturalidad,--yo soy siempre la misma para mi\r\n     querido sobrino, a pesar de sus ideas extravagantes y\r\n                                                  [antireligiosas...]\r\n[10] ¿De qué creerás que me pienso ocupar esta\r\n     noche? Pues de quitarle de la cabeza al tío Licurgo esas\r\n     terquedades con que te piensa molestar. Le he mandado\r\n     venir, y en la galería me está esperando. Descuida, que\r\n     yo lo arreglaré, pues aunque conozco que no le falta\r\n[15] razón....\r\n\r\n     --Gracias, querida tía--repuso el joven, sintiéndose\r\n     invadido por la onda de generosidad que tan fácilmente\r\n     nacía en su alma.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey dirigió la vista hacia donde estaba su prima,\r\n[20] con intención de unirse a ella; pero algunas preguntas\r\n     sagaces del canónigo le retuvieron al lado de doña Perfecta.\r\n     Rosario estaba triste, oyendo con indiferencia melancólica\r\n     las palabras del abogadillo, que instalándose junto a ella,\r\n     había comenzado una retahila de conceptos empalagosos,\r\n[25] con importunos chistes sazonada y fatuidades del peor\r\n     gusto.\r\n\r\n     --Lo peor para ti--dijo doña Perfecta a su sobrino\r\n     cuando le sorprendió observando la desacorde pareja que\r\n     formaban Rosario y Jacinto,--es que has ofendido a la\r\n[30] pobre Rosario. Debes hacer todo lo posible por desenojarla.\r\n     ¡La pobrecita es tan buena!...\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh, sí, tan buena!--añadió el canónigo,--que no\r\n     dudo perdonará a su primo.\r\n\r\n     --Creo que Rosario me ha perdonado ya--afirmó Rey.\r\n\r\n     --Y si no, en corazones angelicales no dura mucho el            68\r\n     resentimiento--dijo D. Inocencio melifluamente.--Yo tengo\r\n     gran ascendiente sobre esa niña, y procuraré disipar en su\r\n     alma generosa toda prevención contra usted. En cuanto yo\r\n[5]  le diga dos palabras....\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey sintió que por su pensamiento pasaba una nube\r\n     y dijo con intención:\r\n\r\n     --Tal vez no sea preciso.\r\n\r\n     --No le hablo ahora--añadió el capitular,--porque\r\n[10] está embelesada oyendo las tonterías de Jacintillo....\r\n     ¡Demonches de chicos! Cuando pegan la hebra, hay que dejarles.\r\n\r\n     De pronto se presentaron en la tertulia el juez de primera\r\n     instancia, la señora del alcalde y el deán de la catedral.\r\n     Todos saludaron al ingeniero, demostrando en sus palabras\r\n[15] y actitudes que satisfacían, al verle, la más viva curiosidad.\r\n     El juez era un mozalvete despabilado, de estos que todos\r\n     los días aparecen en los criaderos de eminencias, aspirando\r\n     recién empollados a los primeros puestos de la\r\n     administración y de la política. Dábase suma importancia, y\r\n[20] hablanco de sí mismo y de su juvenil toga, parecía manifestar\r\n     indirectamente gran enojo, porque no le hubieran hecho de golpe\r\n     y porrazo presidente del Tribunal Supremo. En aquellas\r\n     manos inexpertas, en aquel cerebro henchido de viento, en\r\n     aquella presunción ridícula había puesto el Estado las\r\n[25] funciones más delicadas y más difíciles de la humana\r\n     justicia. Sus maneras eran de perfecto cortesano, y revelaba\r\n     escrupuloso y detallado esmero en todo lo concerniente a su\r\n     persona. Tenía la maldita manía de estarse quitando y\r\n     poniendo a cada instante los lentes de oro, y en su\r\n[30] conversación frecuentemente indicaba el empeño de ser transladado\r\n     pronto a _Madriz_, para prestar sus imprescindibles servicios\r\n     en la secretaría de Gracia y Justicia.\r\n\r\n     La señora del alcalde era una dama bonachona, sin otra\r\n     flaqueza que suponerse muy relacionada en la Corte. Dirigió\r\n     a Pepe Rey diversas preguntas sobre modas, citando establecimientos\r\n     industriales donde le habían hecho una manteleta                69\r\n     o una falda en su último viaje, coetáneo de la visita\r\n     de Muley-Abbas, y también nombró a una docena de duquesas\r\n[5]  y marquesas, tratándolas con tanta familiaridad como\r\n     a amiguitas de escuela. Dijo también que la condesa de\r\n     M. (por sus tertulias famosa) era amiga suya, y que el 60\r\n     estuvo a visitarla, y la condesa la convidó a su palco en el\r\n     Real, donde vio a Muley-Abbas en traje de moro, acompañado\r\n[10] de toda su morería. La alcaldesa hablaba por los\r\n     codos, como suele decirse, y no carecía de chiste.\r\n\r\n     El señor deán era un viejo de edad avanzada, corpulento\r\n     y encendido, pletórico, apoplético, un hombre que se salía\r\n     fuera de sí mismo por no caber en su propio pellejo, según\r\n[15] estaba de gordo y morcilludo. Procedía de la exclaustración;\r\n     no hablaba más que de asuntos religiosos, y desde el\r\n     principio mostró hacia Pepe Rey el desdén más vivo. Éste\r\n     se mostraba cada vez más inepto para acomodarse a sociedad\r\n     tan poco de su gusto. Era su carácter nada maleable,\r\n[20] duro y de muy escasa flexibilidad, y rechazaba las perfidias\r\n     y acomodamientos de lenguaje para simular la concordia\r\n     cuando no existía. Mantúvose, pues, bastante grave durante\r\n     el curso de la fastidiosa tertulia, obligado a resistir el ímpetu\r\n     oratorio de la alcaldesa que, sin ser la Fama, tenía el privilegio\r\n[25] de fatigar con cien lenguas el oído humano. Si en el\r\n     breve respiro que esta señora daba a sus oyentes, Pepe Rey\r\n     quería acercarse a su prima, pegábasele el Penitenciario\r\n     como el molusco a la roca, y llevándole aparte con ademán\r\n     misterioso, le proponía un paseo a Mundogrande con el\r\n[30] Sr. D. Cayetano o una partida de pesca en las claras aguas\r\n     del Nahara.\r\n\r\n     Por fin esto concluyó, porque todo concluye en este\r\n     mundo. Retiróse el señor deán, dejando la casa vacía, y\r\n     bien pronto no quedó de la señora alcaldesa más que un\r\n     eco, semejante al zumbido que recuerda en la humana oreja       70\r\n     el reciente paso de una tempestad. El juez privó también\r\n     a la tertulia de su presencia, y por fin D. Inocencio dió a su\r\n     sobrino la señal de partida.\r\n\r\n[5]  --Vamos, niño, vámonos que es tarde--le dijo sonriendo.\r\n     --¡Cuánto has mareado a la pobre Rosarito!... ¿Verdad,\r\n     niña? Anda, buena pieza, a casa pronto.\r\n\r\n     --Es hora de acostarse--dijo doña Perfecta.\r\n\r\n     --Hora de trabajar--repuso el abogadillo.\r\n\r\n[10] --Por más que le digo que despache los negocios de día--añadió\r\n     el canónigo,--no hace caso.\r\n\r\n     --¡Son tantos los negocios... pero tantos...!\r\n\r\n     --No, di más bien que esa endiablada obra en que te has\r\n     metido... Él no lo quiere decir, Sr. D. José; pero sepa\r\n[15] usted que se ha puesto a escribir una obra sobre _La influencia\r\n     de la mujer en la sociedad cristiana_, y además una\r\n     _Ojeada sobre el movimiento católico en_... no sé dónde.\r\n     ¿Qué entiendes tú de _ojeadas_ ni de _influencias_?... Estos\r\n     rapaces del día se atreven a todo. ¡Uf... qué chicos!...\r\n[20] Con que vámonos a casa. Buenas noches, señora doña\r\n     Perfecta... buenas noches, Sr. D. José... Rosarito....\r\n\r\n     --Yo esperaré al Sr. D. Cayetano--dijo Jacinto,--para\r\n     que me dé el _Augusto Nicolás._\r\n\r\n     --¡Siempre cargando libros... hombre!... A veces\r\n[25] entras en casa que pareces un burro. Pues bien, esperemos.\r\n\r\n     --El Sr. D. Jacinto--dijo Pepe Rey,--no escribe a la\r\n     ligera y se prepara bien para que sus obras sean un tesoro\r\n     de erudición.\r\n\r\n     --Pero ese niño va a enfermar de la cabeza, Sr. D. Inocencio--\r\n[30] objetó doña Perfecta.--Por Dios, mucho cuidado.\r\n     Yo le pondría tasa en sus lecturas.\r\n\r\n     --Ya que esperamos--indicó el doctorcillo con notorio\r\n     acento de presunción,--me llevaré también el tercer tomo\r\n     de _Concilios_, ¿No le parece a usted, tío?...\r\n\r\n     --Hombre, sí; no dejes eso de la mano. Pues no                  71\r\n     faltaba más.\r\n\r\n     Felizmente llegó pronto el Sr. D. Cayetano (que tertuliaba\r\n     de ordinario en casa de D. Lorenzo Ruiz), y entregados los\r\n[5]  libros, marcháronse tío y sobrino.\r\n\r\n     Rey leyó en el triste semblante de su prima deseo muy\r\n     vivo de hablarle. Acercóse a ella mientras doña Perfecta y\r\n     D. Cayetano trataban a solas de un negocio doméstico.\r\n\r\n     --Has ofendido a mamá--le dijo Rosario.\r\n\r\n[10] Sus facciones indicaban una especie de terror.\r\n\r\n     --Es verdad--repuso el joven.--He ofendido a tu\r\n     mamá: te he ofendido a ti....\r\n\r\n     --No; a mí no. Ya se me figuraba a mí que el Niño\r\n     Jesús no debe gastar calzones.\r\n\r\n[15] --Pero espero que una y otra me perdonarán. Tu mamá\r\n     me ha manifestado hace poco tanta bondad....\r\n\r\n     La voz de doña Perfecta vibró de súbito en el ámbito del\r\n     comedor, con tan discorde acento, que el sobrino se estremeció\r\n     cual si oyese un grito de alarma. La voz dijo\r\n[20] imperiosamente:\r\n\r\n     --¡Rosario, vete a acostar!\r\n\r\n     Turbada y llena de congoja, la muchacha dió varias\r\n     vueltas por la habitación, haciendo como que buscaba\r\n     alguna cosa. Con todo disimulo pronunció al pasar por\r\n[25] junto a su primo estas vagas palabras:\r\n\r\n     --Mamá está enojada....\r\n\r\n     --Pero....\r\n\r\n     --Está enojada... no te fíes, no te fíes.\r\n\r\n     Y se marchó. Siguióla después doña Perfecta, a quien\r\n[30] aguardaba el tío Licurgo, y durante un rato, las voces de la\r\n     señora y del aldeano oyéronse confundidas en familiar conferencia.\r\n     Quedóse solo Pepe con D. Cayetano, el cual,\r\n     tomando una luz, habló así:\r\n\r\n     --Buenas noches, Pepe. No crea usted que voy a\r\n     dormir, voy a trabajar... ¿Pero por qué está usted tan          72\r\n     meditabundo? ¿Qué tiene usted?... Pues, sí, a trabajar.\r\n     Estoy sacando apuntes para un _Discurso-Memoria_ sobre los\r\n     _Linajes de Orbajosa_... He encontrado datos y noticias de\r\n[5]  grandísimo precio. No hay que darle vueltas. En todas\r\n     las épocas de nuestra historia los orbajosenses se han distinguido\r\n     por su hidalguía, por su nobleza, por su valor, por su\r\n     entendimiento. Díganlo si no la conquista de Méjico, las\r\n     guerras del Emperador, las de Felipe contra herejes...\r\n[10] ¿Pero está usted malo? ¿Qué le pasa a usted?... Pues,\r\n     sí, teólogos eminentes, bravos guerreros, conquistadores,\r\n     santos, obispos, poetas, políticos, toda suerte de hombres\r\n     esclarecidos florecieron en esta humilde tierra del ajo...\r\n     No, no hay en la cristiandad pueblo más ilustre que el\r\n[15] nuestro. Sus virtudes y sus glorias llenan toda la historia\r\n     patria y aun sobra algo... Vamos, veo que lo que usted\r\n     tiene es sueño: buenas noches... Pues, sí, no cambiaría\r\n     la gloria de ser hijo de esta noble tierra por todo el oro del\r\n     mundo. _Augusta_ llamáronla los antiguos, _augustísima_ la\r\n[20] llamo yo ahora, porque ahora, como entonces, la hidalguía,\r\n     la generosidad, el valor, la nobleza, son patrimonio de ella...\r\n     Con que buenas noches, querido Pepe... se me\r\n     figura que usted no está bueno. ¿Le ha hecho daño la\r\n     cena?... Razón tiene Alonzo González de Bustamante\r\n[25] en su _Floresta amena_ al decir que los habitantes de Orbajosa\r\n     bastan por sí solos para dar grandeza y honor a un reino.\r\n     ¿No lo cree usted así?\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh! sí, señor, sin duda ninguna--repuso Pepe Rey,\r\n     dirigiéndose bruscamente a su cuarto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                     73\r\n                                    XI\r\n\r\n                           =La discordia crece=\r\n\r\n     En los días sucesivos Rey hizo conocimiento con varias\r\n     personas de la población y visitó el Casino, trabando amistades\r\n     con algunos individuos de los que pasaban la vida\r\n     en las salas de aquella corporación.\r\n\r\n[5]  Pero la juventud de Orbajosa no vivía constantemente\r\n     allí, como podrá suponer la malevolencia. Veíanse por las\r\n     tardes en la esquina de la catedral y en la plazoleta formada\r\n     por el cruce de las calles del Condestable y la Tripería,\r\n     algunos caballeros que gallardamente envueltos en sus capas\r\n[10] estaban como de centinela viendo pasar la gente. Si el\r\n     tiempo era bueno, aquellas eminentes lumbreras de la cultura\r\n     _urbsaugustense_ se dirigían, siempre con la indispensable\r\n     capita, al titulado paseo de las Descalzas, el cual se componía\r\n     de dos hileras de tísicos olmos y algunas retamas descoloridas.\r\n[15] Allí la brillante pléyade atisbaba a las niñas de\r\n     D. Fulano o de D. Perencejo, que también habían ido a\r\n     paseo, y la tarde se pasaba regularmente. Entrada la\r\n     noche, el Casino se llenaba de nuevo, y mientras una parte\r\n     de los socios entregaba su alto entendimiento a las delicias\r\n[20] del monte, los otros leían periódicos, y los más discutían en\r\n     la sala del café sobre asuntos de diversa índole, como\r\n     política, caballos, toros, o bien sobre chismes locales. El\r\n     resumen de todos los debates era siempre la supremacía de\r\n     Orbajosa y de sus habitantes sobre los demás pueblos y\r\n[25] gentes de la tierra.\r\n\r\n     Eran aquellos varones insignes lo más granado de la\r\n     ilustre ciudad, propietarios ricos los unos, pobrísimos los\r\n     otros, pero libres de altas aspiraciones todos. Tenían la\r\n     imperturbable serenidad del mendigo, que nada apetece\r\n[30] mientras no le falte un mendrugo para engañar el hambre y\r\n     el sol para calentarse. Lo que principalmente distinguía a      74\r\n     los orbajosenses del Casino era un sentimiento de viva\r\n     hostilidad hacia todo lo que de fuera viniese. Y siempre\r\n     que algún forastero de viso se presentaba en las augustas\r\n[5]  salas, creíanle venido a poner en duda la superioridad de la\r\n     patria del ajo, o a disputarle por envidia las preeminencias\r\n     incontrovertibles que Natura le concediera.\r\n\r\n     Cuando Pepe Rey se presentó, recibiéronle con cierto\r\n     recelo, y como en el Casino abundaba la gente graciosa, al\r\n[10] cuarto de hora de estar allí el nuevo socio, ya se habían\r\n     dicho acerca de él toda suerte de cuchufletas. Cuando a\r\n     las reiteradas preguntas de los socios contestó que había\r\n     venido a Orbajosa con encargo de explorar la cuenca hullera\r\n     del Nahara y estudiar un camino, todos convinieron en que\r\n[15] el Sr. D. José era un fatuo, que quería darse tono inventando\r\n     criaderos de carbón y vías férreas. Alguno añadió:\r\n\r\n     --Pero en buena parte se ha metido. Estos señores\r\n     sabios creen que aquí somos tontos y que se nos engaña\r\n     con palabrotas... Ha venido a casarse con la niña de\r\n[20] doña Perfecta, y cuanto diga de cuencas hulleras es para\r\n     echar facha.\r\n\r\n     --Pues esta mañana--indicó otro, que era un comerciante\r\n     quebrado,--me dijeron en casa de las de Domínguez\r\n     que ese señor no tiene una peseta, y viene a que su\r\n[25] tía le mantenga y a ver si puede pescar a Rosarito.\r\n\r\n     --Parece que ni es tal ingeniero ni cosa que lo valga--añadió\r\n     un propietario de olivos, que tenía empeñadas sus\r\n     fincas por el doble de lo que valían.--Pero ya se ve...\r\n     Estos hambrientos de Madrid se creen autorizados para\r\n[30] engañar a los pobres provincianos, y como creen que aquí\r\n     andamos con taparrabos, amigo....\r\n\r\n     --Bien se conoce que tiene hambre.\r\n\r\n     --Pues entre bromas y veras nos dijo anoche que éramos\r\n     unos bárbaros holgazanes.\r\n\r\n     --Que vivíamos como los beduinos, tomando el sol.               75\r\n\r\n     --Que vivíamos con la imaginación.\r\n\r\n     --Eso es: que vivíamos con la imaginación.\r\n\r\n     --Y que esta ciudad era lo mismito que las de Marruecos.\r\n\r\n[5]  --Hombre, no hay paciencia para oír eso. ¿Dónde\r\n     habrá visto él (como no sea en París) una calle semejante\r\n     a la del Condestable, que presenta un frente de siete casas\r\n     alineadas, todas magníficas, desde la de doña Perfecta a la\r\n     de Nicolasito Hernández?... Se figuran estos canallas\r\n[10] que uno no ha visto nada, ni ha estado en París....\r\n\r\n     --También dijo con mucha delicadeza que Orbajosa era\r\n     un pueblo de mendigos, y dió a entender que aquí vivimos\r\n     en la mayor miseria sin darnos cuenta de ello.\r\n\r\n     --¡Válgame Dios! si me lo llega a decir a mí, hay un\r\n[15] escándalo en el Casino--exclamó el recaudador de contribuciones.\r\n     --¿Por qué no le dijeron la cantidad de arrobas\r\n     de aceite que produjo Orbajosa el año pasado? ¿No sabe\r\n     ese estúpido que en años buenos Orbajosa da pan para toda\r\n     España y aun para toda Europa? Verdad es que ya llevamos\r\n[20] no sé cuántos años de mala cosecha; pero eso no es\r\n     ley. Pues ¿y la cosecha del ajo? ¿A que no sabe ese\r\n     señor que los ajos de Orbajosa dejaron bizcos a los señores\r\n     del Jurado en la Exposición de Londres?\r\n\r\n     Estos y otros diálogos se oían en las salas del Casino por\r\n[25] aquellos días. A pesar de estas hablillas tan comunes en\r\n     los pueblos pequeños, que por lo mismo que son enanos\r\n     suelen ser soberbios, Rey no dejó de encontrar amigos sinceros\r\n     en la docta corporación, pues ni todos eran maldicientes\r\n     ni faltaban allí personas de buen sentido. Pero\r\n[30] tenía nuestro joven la desgracia, si desgracia puede llamarse,\r\n     de manifestar sus impresiones con inusitada franqueza, y\r\n     esto le atrajo algunas antipatías.\r\n\r\n     Iban pasando días. Además del disgusto natural que las\r\n     costumbres de la sociedad episcopal le producían, diversas\r\n     causas todas desagradables empezaban a desarrollar en su        76\r\n     ánimo honda tristeza, siendo de notar principalmente, entre\r\n     aquellas causas, la turba de pleiteantes que cual enjambre\r\n     voraz se arrojó sobre él. No era sólo el tío Licurgo, sino\r\n[5]  otros muchos colindantes los que le reclamaban daños y\r\n     perjuicios, o bien le pedían cuentas de tierras administradas\r\n     por su abuelo. También le presentaron una demanda por\r\n     no sé qué contrato de aparcería que celebró su madre y no\r\n     fué al parecer cumplido, y asimismo le exigieron el reconocimiento\r\n[10] de una hipoteca sobre las tierras de _Alamillos_,\r\n     hecha en extraño documento por su tío. Era un hormiguero,\r\n     una inmunda gusanera de pleitos. Había hecho\r\n     propósito de renunciar a la propiedad de sus fincas; pero\r\n     entre tanto su dignidad le obligaba a no ceder ante las\r\n[15] marrullerías de los sagaces palurdos; y como el Ayuntamiento\r\n     le reclamó también por supuesta confusión de su\r\n     finca con un inmediato monte de Propios, vióse el desgraciado\r\n     joven en el caso de tener que disipar las dudas que\r\n     acerca de su derecho surgían a cada paso. Su honra estaba\r\n[20] comprometida, y no había otro remedio que pleitear o morir.\r\n\r\n     Habíale prometido doña Perfecta en su magnanimidad\r\n     ayudarle a salir de tan torpes líos por medio de un arreglo\r\n     amistoso; pero pasaban días y los buenos oficios de la\r\n     ejemplar señora no daban resultado alguno. Crecían los\r\n[25] pleitos con la amenazadora presteza de una enfermedad\r\n     fulminante. Pepe Rey pasaba largas horas del día en el\r\n     Juzgado dando declaraciones, contestando a preguntas y a\r\n     repreguntas, y cuando se retiraba a su casa, fatigado y\r\n     colérico, veía aparecer la afilada y grotesca carátula del\r\n[30] escribano, que le traía regular porción de papel sellado\r\n     lleno de horribles fórmulas... para que fuese estudiando\r\n     la cuestión.\r\n\r\n     Se comprende que aquél no era hombre a propósito para\r\n     sufrir tales reveses, pudiendo evitarlos con la ausencia.\r\n\r\n     Representábase en su imaginación a la noble ciudad de su        77\r\n     madre como una horrible bestia que en él clavaba sus\r\n     feroces uñas y le bebía la sangre. Para librarse de ella\r\n     bastábale, según su creencia, la fuga; pero un interés\r\n[5]  profundo, como interés del corazón, le detenía, atándole a\r\n     la peña de su martirio con lazos muy fuertes. Sin embargo,\r\n     llegó a sentirse tan fuera de su centro, llegó a verse tan\r\n     extranjero, digámoslo así, en aquella tenebrosa ciudad de\r\n     pleitos, de antiguallas, de envidia y de maledicencia, que\r\n[10] hizo propósito de abandonarla sin dilación, insistiendo al\r\n     mismo tiempo en el proyecto que a ella le condujera. Una\r\n     mañana, encontrando ocasión a propósito, formuló su plan\r\n     ante doña Perfecta.\r\n\r\n     --Sobrino mío--repuso la señora con su acostumbrada\r\n[15] dulzura:--no seas arrebatado. Vaya, que pareces de\r\n     fuego. Lo mismo era tu padre ¡qué hombre! Eres una\r\n     centella... Ya te he dicho que con muchísimo gusto te\r\n     llamaré hijo mío. Aunque no tuvieras las buenas cualidades\r\n     y el talento que te distinguen (salvo los defectillos, que también\r\n[20] los hay); aunque no fueras un excelente joven, basta\r\n     que esta unión haya sido propuesta por tu padre, a quien\r\n     tanto debemos mi hija y yo, para que la acepte. Rosario\r\n     no se opondrá tampoco, queriéndolo yo. ¿Qué falta, pues?\r\n     Nada; no falta nada más que un poco tiempo. No se\r\n[25] puede hacer el casamiento con la precipitación que tú deseas,\r\n     y que daría lugar a interpretaciones quizás desfavorables a\r\n     la honra de mi querida hija... Vaya, que tú como no\r\n     piensas más que en máquinas, todo lo quieres hacer al\r\n     vapor. Espera, hombre, espera... ¿qué prisa tienes?\r\n[30] Ese aborrecimiento que le has cogido a nuestra pobre Orbajosa\r\n     es un capricho. Ya se ve: no puedes vivir sino entre\r\n     condes y marqueses y oradores y diplomáticos... ¡Quieres\r\n     casarte y separarme de mi hija para siempre!--añadió\r\n     enjugándose una lágrima.--Ya que así es, inconsiderado\r\n     joven, ten al menos la caridad de retardar algún tiempo esa     78\r\n     boda que tanto deseas... ¡Qué impaciencia! ¡Qué\r\n     amor tan fuerte! No creí que una pobre lugareña como mi\r\n     hija inspirase pasiones tan volcánicas.\r\n\r\n[5]  No convencieron a Pepe Rey los razonamientos de su tía;\r\n     pero no quiso contrariarla. Resolvió, pues, esperar cuanto\r\n     le fuese posible. Una nueva causa de disgustos unióse bien\r\n     pronto a los que ya amargaban su existencia. Hacía dos\r\n     semanas que estaba en Orbajosa, y durante este tiempo no\r\n[10] había recibido ninguna carta de su padre. No podía achacarse\r\n     esto a descuidos de la Administración de Correos de\r\n     Orbajosa, porque siendo el funcionario encargado de aquel\r\n     servicio amigo y protegido de doña Perfecta, ésta le recomendaba\r\n     diariamente el mayor cuidado para que las cartas dirigidas\r\n[15] a su sobrino no se extraviasen. También iba a la\r\n     casa el conductor de la correspondencia, llamado Cristóbal\r\n     Ramos, y por apodo Caballuco, personaje a quien ya conocimos,\r\n     y a éste solía dirigir doña Perfecta amonestaciones\r\n     y reprimendas tan enérgicas como la siguiente:\r\n\r\n[20] --¡Bonito servicio de correos tenéis!... ¿Cómo es\r\n     que mi sobrino no ha recibido una sola carta desde que está\r\n     en Orbajosa?... Cuando la conducción de la correspondencia\r\n     corre a cargo de semejante tarambana, ¡cómo han\r\n     de andar las cosas! Yo le hablaré al señor Gobernador de\r\n[25] la provincia para que mire bien qué clase de gente pone en\r\n     la Administración.\r\n\r\n     Caballuco, alzando los hombros, miraba a Rey con\r\n     expresión de la más completa indiferencia.\r\n\r\n     Un día entró con un pliego en la mano.\r\n\r\n[30] --¡Gracias a Dios!--dijo doña Perfecta a su sobrino.--Ahí\r\n     tienes cartas de tu padre. Regocíjate, hombre. Buen\r\n     susto nos hemos llevado por la pereza de mi señor hermano\r\n     en escribir... ¿Qué dice? está bueno sin duda--añadió al\r\n     ver que Pepe Rey abría el pliego con febril impaciencia.\r\n\r\n     El ingeniero se puso pálido al recorrer las primeras            79\r\n     líneas.\r\n\r\n     --¡Jesús, Pepe... qué tienes!--exclamó la señora,\r\n     levantándose con _zozobra_.--¿Está malo tu papá?\r\n\r\n[5]  --Esta carta no es de mi padre--repuso Pepe, revelando\r\n     en su semblante la mayor consternación.\r\n\r\n     --¿Pues qué es eso?...\r\n\r\n     --Una orden del Ministerio de Fomento, en que se me\r\n     releva del cargo que me confiaron....\r\n\r\n[10] --¡Cómo... es posible!\r\n\r\n     --Una destitución pura y simple, redactada en términos\r\n     muy poco lisonjeros para mí.\r\n\r\n     --¿Hase visto mayor picardía?--exclamó la señora,\r\n     volviendo de su estupor.\r\n\r\n[15] --¡Qué humillación!--murmuró el joven.--Es la primera\r\n     vez en mi vida que recibo un desaire semejante.\r\n\r\n     --¡Pero ese Gobierno no tiene perdón de Dios! ¡Desairarte\r\n     a ti! ¿Quieres que yo escriba a Madrid? Tengo\r\n     allá muy buenas relaciones y podré conseguir que el Gobierno\r\n[20] repare esa falta brutal y te dé una satisfacción.\r\n\r\n     --Gracias, señora, no quiero recomendaciones--replicó\r\n     el joven con displicencia.\r\n\r\n     --¡Es que se ven unas injusticias; unos atropellos!\r\n     ...Destituir así a un joven de tanto mérito, a una eminencia\r\n[25] científica.... Vamos; si no puedo contener la\r\n     cólera.\r\n\r\n     --Yo averiguaré--dijo Pepe, con la mayor energía,--quién\r\n     se ocupa en hacerme daño....\r\n\r\n     --Ese señor ministro.... Pero de estos politiquejos\r\n[30] infames ¿qué se puede esperar?\r\n\r\n     --Aquí hay alguien que se ha propuesto hacerme morir\r\n     de desesperación--afirmó el joven visiblemente alterado.--Esto\r\n     no es obra del ministro, ésta y otras contrariedades\r\n     que experimento son resultado de un plan de venganza, de\r\n     un cálculo desconocido, de una enemistad irreconciliable, y     80\r\n     este plan, este cálculo, esta enemistad, no lo dude usted,\r\n     querida tía, están aquí, en Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     --Tú te has vuelto loco--replicó doña Perfecta, demostrando\r\n[5]  un sentimiento semejante a la compasión.--¿Que\r\n     tienes enemigos en Orbajosa? ¿Que alguien quiere vengarse\r\n     de ti? Vamos, Pepillo, tú has perdido el juicio. Las\r\n     lecturas de esos libros en que se dice que tenemos por\r\n     abuelos a los monos o a las cotorras, te han trastornado la\r\n[10] cabeza.\r\n\r\n     Sonrió con dulzura al decir la última frase, y después,\r\n     tomando un tono de familiar y cariñosa amonestación,\r\n     añadió:\r\n\r\n     --Hijo mío, los habitantes de Orbajosa seremos palurdos\r\n[15] y toscos labriegos sin instrucción, sin finura, ni buen tono;\r\n     pero a lealtad y buena fe no nos gana nadie, nadie, pero\r\n     nadie.\r\n\r\n     --No crea usted--dijo el joven,--que acuso a las personas\r\n     de esta casa. Pero sostengo que en la ciudad está\r\n[20] mi implacable y fiero enemigo.\r\n\r\n     --Deseo que me enseñes ese traidor de melodrama--repuso\r\n     la señora, sonriendo de nuevo.--Supongo que no\r\n     acusarás al tío Licurgo ni a los demás que te han puesto\r\n     pleito, porque los pobrecitos creen defender su derecho.\r\n[25] Y entre paréntesis, no les falta razón en el caso presente.\r\n     Además, el tío Lucas te quiere mucho. Así mismo me lo\r\n     ha dicho. Desde que te conoció, dice que le entraste por\r\n     el ojo derecho, y el pobre viejo te ha puesto un cariño....\r\n\r\n     --¡Sí... profundo cariño!--murmuró Pepe.\r\n\r\n[30] --No seas tonto--añadió la señora, poniéndole la mano\r\n     en el hombro y mirándole de cerca.--No pienses disparates,\r\n     y convéncete de que tu enemigo, si existe, está en Madrid,\r\n     en aquel centro de corrupción, de envidia y rivalidades, no\r\n     en este pacífico y sosegado rincón, donde todo es buena\r\n     voluntad y concordia... Sin duda algún envidioso de tu          81\r\n     mérito... Te advierto una cosa, y es, que si quieres ir\r\n     allá para averiguar la causa de este desaire y pedir explicaciones\r\n     al gobierno, no dejes de hacerlo por nosotras.\r\n\r\n[5]  Pepe Rey fijó los ojos en el semblante de su tía, cual si\r\n     quisiera escudriñarla hasta en lo más escondido de su alma.\r\n\r\n     --Digo que si quieres ir, no dejes de hacerlo--repitió\r\n     la señora con calma admirable, confundiéndose en la\r\n     expresión de su semblante la naturalidad con la honradez\r\n[10] más pura.\r\n\r\n     --No, señora. No pienso ir allá.\r\n\r\n     --Mejor; ésa es también mi opinión. Aquí estás más\r\n     tranquilo, a pesar de las cavilaciones con que te estás\r\n     atormentando. ¡Pobre Pepillo! Tu entendimiento, tu descomunal\r\n[15] entendimiento, es la causa de tu desgracia.\r\n     Nosotros, los de Orbajosa, pobres aldeanos rústicos, vivimos\r\n     felices en nuestra ignorancia. Yo siento mucho que no\r\n     estés contento. ¿Pero es culpa mía que te aburras y desesperes\r\n     sin motivo? ¿No te trato como a un hijo? ¿No te\r\n[20] he recibido como la esperanza de mi casa? ¿Puedo hacer\r\n     más por ti? Si a pesar de eso, no nos quieres, si nos\r\n     muestras tanto despego, si te burlas de nuestra religiosidad,\r\n     si haces desprecios a nuestros amigos, ¿es acaso porque no\r\n     te tratemos bien?\r\n\r\n[25] Los ojos de doña Perfecta se humedecieron.\r\n\r\n     --Querida tía--dijo Rey, sintiendo que se disipaba su\r\n     encono.--También yo he cometido algunas faltas desde\r\n     que soy huésped de esta casa.\r\n\r\n     --No seas tonto... ¡Qué faltas ni faltas! Entre\r\n[30] personas de la misma familia, todo se perdona.\r\n\r\n     --Pero Rosario ¿dónde está?--preguntó el joven levantándose.--\r\n     ¿Tampoco la veré hoy?\r\n\r\n     --Está mejor. ¿Sabes que no ha querido bajar?\r\n\r\n     --Subiré yo.\r\n\r\n     --Hombre, no. Esa niña tiene unas terquedades... Hoy            82\r\n     se ha empeñado en no salir de su cuarto. Se ha\r\n     encerrado por dentro.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué rareza!\r\n\r\n[5] --Se le pasará. Seguramente se le pasará. Veremos\r\n     si esta noche le quitamos de la cabeza sus ideas melancólicas.\r\n     Organizaremos una tertulia que le divierta. ¿Por\r\n     qué no te vas a casa del Sr. D. Inocencio y le dices que\r\n     venga por acá esta noche y que traiga a Jacintillo?\r\n\r\n[10] --¡A Jacintillo!\r\n\r\n     --Sí, cuando a Rosario le dan estos accesos de melancolía,\r\n     ese jovencito es el único que la distrae...\r\n\r\n     --Pero yo subiré...\r\n\r\n     --Hombre, no.\r\n\r\n[15] --Cuidado que hay etiqueta en esta casa.\r\n\r\n     --Tú te estás burlando de nosotros. Haz lo que te\r\n     digo.\r\n\r\n     --Pues quiero verla.\r\n\r\n     --Pues no. ¡Qué mal conoces a la niña!\r\n\r\n[20] --Yo creí conocerla bien... Bueno, me quedaré...\r\n     Pero esta soledad es horrible.\r\n\r\n     --Ahí tienes al señor escribano.\r\n\r\n     --Maldito sea él mil veces.\r\n\r\n[25] --Y me parece que ha entrado también el señor procurador...\r\n     es un excelente sujeto.\r\n\r\n     --Así le ahorcaran.\r\n\r\n     --Hombre, los asuntos de intereses, cuando son propios,\r\n     sirven de distracción. Alguien llega... Me parece que\r\n     es el perito agrónomo. Ya tienes para un rato.\r\n\r\n[30] --¡Para un rato de infierno!\r\n\r\n     --Hola, hola, si no me engaño, el tío Licurgo y el tío\r\n     Pasolargo acaban de entrar. Puede que vengan a proponerte\r\n     un arreglo.\r\n\r\n     --Me arrojaré al estanque.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué descastado eres! ¡Pues todos ellos te quieren            83\r\n     tanto!... Vamos, para que nada falte, ahí está también\r\n     el alguacil. Viene a citarte.\r\n\r\n     --A crucificarme.\r\n\r\n[5]  Todos los personajes nombrados fueron entrando en la\r\n     sala.\r\n\r\n     --Adiós, Pepe, que te diviertas--dijo doña Perfecta.\r\n\r\n     --¡Trágame, tierra!--exclamó el joven con desesperación.\r\n\r\n[10] --Sr. D. José....\r\n\r\n     --Mi querido Sr. D. José....\r\n\r\n     --Estimable Sr. D. José....\r\n\r\n     --Sr. D. José de mi alma....\r\n\r\n     --Mi respetable amigo Sr. D. José....\r\n\r\n[15] Al oir estas almibaradas insinuaciones, Pepe Rey exhaló\r\n     un hondo suspiro y se entregó. Entregó su cuerpo y su\r\n     alma a los sayones, que esgrimieron horribles hojas de papel\r\n     sellado, mientras la víctima, elevando los ojos al cielo, decía\r\n     para sí con cristiana mansedumbre:\r\n\r\n[20] --Padre mío, ¿por qué me has abandonado?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XII\r\n\r\n                            =Aquí fué Troya=\r\n\r\n     Amor, amistad, aire sano para la respiración moral, luz\r\n     para el alma, simpatía, fácil comercio de ideas y de sensaciones\r\n     era lo que Pepe Rey necesitaba de una manera\r\n     imperiosa. No teniéndolo, aumentaban las sombras que\r\n[25] envolvían su espíritu, y la lobreguez interior daba a su trato\r\n     displicencia y amargura. Al día siguiente de las escenas\r\n     referidas en el capítulo anterior, mortificóle más que nada\r\n     el ya demasiado largo y misterioso encierro de su prima,\r\n     motivado, al parecer, primero por una enfermedad sin importancia,\r\n     después por caprichos y nerviosidades de difícil                84\r\n     explicación.\r\n\r\n     Rey extrañaba conducta tan contraria a la idea que había\r\n     formado de Rosarito. Habían transcurrido cuatro días sin\r\n[5]  verla, no ciertamente porque a él le faltasen deseos de estar\r\n     a su lado; y tal situación comenzaba a ser desairada y\r\n     ridícula, si con un acto de firme iniciativa no ponía remedio\r\n     en ello.\r\n\r\n     --¿Tampoco hoy veré a mi prima?--preguntó de mal\r\n[10] talante a su tía, cuando concluyeron de comer.\r\n\r\n     --Tampoco. ¡Sabe Dios cuánto lo siento!... Bastante\r\n     le he predicado hoy. A la tarde veremos....\r\n\r\n     La sospecha de que en tan injustificado encierro su\r\n     adorable prima era más bien víctima sin defensa que autora\r\n[15] resuelta con actividad propia e iniciativa, le indujo a contenerse\r\n     y esperar. Sin esta sospecha, hubiera partido aquel\r\n     mismo día. No tenía duda alguna de ser amado por Rosario,\r\n     mas era evidente que una presión desconocida actuaba\r\n     entre los dos para separarlos, y parecía propio de varón\r\n[20] honrado averiguar de quién procedía aquella fuerza maligna,\r\n     y contrarrestarla hasta donde alcanzara la voluntad humana.\r\n\r\n     --Espero que la obstinación de Rosario no durará mucho--dijo\r\n     a doña Perfecta disimulando sus verdaderos sentimientos.\r\n\r\n[25] Aquel día tuvo una carta de su padre, en la cual éste se\r\n     quejaba de no haber recibido ninguna de Orbajosa, circunstancia\r\n     que aumentó las inquietudes del ingeniero, confundiéndole\r\n     más. Por último, después de vagar largo rato solo\r\n     por la huerta de la casa, salió y fue al Casino. Entró en él,\r\n[30] como un desesperado que se arroja al mar.\r\n\r\n     Encontró en las principales salas a varias personas que\r\n     charlaban y discutían. En un grupo desentrañaban con\r\n     lógica sutil difíciles problemas de toros; en otro disertaban\r\n     sobre cuáles eran los mejores burros entre las castas de\r\n     Orbajosa y Villahorrenda. Hastiado hasta lo sumo, Pepe          85\r\n     Rey abandonó estos debates y se dirigió a la sala de periódicos,\r\n     donde hojeó varias revistas sin encontrar deleite en\r\n     la lectura; y poco después, pasando de sala en sala, fué a\r\n[5]  parar sin saber cómo a la del juego. Cerca de dos horas\r\n     estuvo en las garras del horrible demonio amarillo, cuyos\r\n     resplandecientes ojos de oro producen tormento y fascinación.\r\n     Ni aun las emociones del juego alteraron el sombrío\r\n     estado de su alma, y el tedio que antes le empujara hacia\r\n[10] el verde tapete, apartóle también de él. Huyendo del\r\n     bullicio, dió con su cuerpo en una estancia destinada a tertulia,\r\n     en la cual a la sazón no había alma viviente, y con\r\n     indolencia se sentó junto a la ventana de ella, mirando\r\n     a la calle.\r\n\r\n[15] Era ésta angostísima y con más ángulos y recodos que\r\n     casas, sombreada toda por la pavorosa catedral, que al\r\n     extremo alzaba su negro muro carcomido. Pepe Rey miró\r\n     a todos lados, arriba y abajo, y observó un plácido silencio\r\n     de sepulcro: ni un paso, ni una voz, ni una mirada. De\r\n[20] pronto hirieron su oído rumores extraños, como cuchicheo\r\n     de femeniles labios, y después el chirrido de cortinajes que\r\n     se corrían, algunas palabras, y por fin el tararear suave de\r\n     una canción, el ladrido de un falderillo, y otras señales de\r\n     existencia social que parecían muy singulares en tal sitio.\r\n[25] Observando bien, Pepe Rey vió que tales rumores procedían\r\n     de un enorme balcón con celosías, que frente por frente\r\n     a la ventana mostraba su corpulenta fábrica. No había\r\n     concluído sus observaciones, cuando un socio del Casino\r\n     apareció de súbito a su lado, y riendo le interpeló de este\r\n[30] modo:\r\n\r\n     --¡Ah! Sr. D. Pepe, ¡picarón! ¿se ha encerrado usted\r\n     aquí para hacer cocos a las niñas?\r\n\r\n     El que esto decía era D. Juan Tafetán, un sujeto amabilísimo,\r\n     y de los pocos que habían manifestado a Rey en el\r\n     Casino cordial amistad y verdadera admiración. Con su           86\r\n     carilla bermellonada, su bigotejo teñido de negro, sus\r\n     ojuelos vivarachos, su estatura mezquina, su pelo con gran\r\n     estudio peinado para ocultar la calvicie, D. Juan Tafetán\r\n[5]  presentaba una figura bastante diferente de la de Antinoo;\r\n     pero era muy simpático, tenía mucho gracejo y felicísimo\r\n     ingenio para contar aventuras graciosas. Reía mucho, y\r\n     al hacerlo, su cara se cubría toda, desde la frente a la barba,\r\n     de grotescas arrugas. A pesar de estas cualidades y del\r\n[10] aplauso que debía estimular su disposición a las picantes\r\n     burlas, no era maldiciente. Queríanle todos, y Pepe Rey\r\n     pasaba con él ratos agradables. El pobre Tafetán, empleado\r\n     antaño en la Administración civil de la capital de la provincia,\r\n     vivía modestamente de su sueldo en la Secretaría\r\n[15] de Beneficencia, y completaba su pasar tocando gallardamente\r\n     el clarinete en las procesiones, en las solemnidades\r\n     de la catedral y en el teatro, cuando alguna trailla de\r\n     desesperados cómicos aparecía por aquellos países con el alevoso\r\n     propósito de dar funciones en Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n[20] Pero lo más singular en D. Juan Tafetán era su afición\r\n     a las muchachas guapas. Él mismo, cuando no ocultaba su\r\n     calvicie con seis pelos llenos de pomada, cuando no se teñía\r\n     el bigote, cuande andaba derechito y espigado por la poca\r\n     pesadumbre de los años, había sido un Tenorio formidable.\r\n[25] Oírle contar sus conquistas era cosa de morirse de risa,\r\n     porque hay Tenorios de Tenorios, y aquél fué de los más\r\n     originales.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué niñas? Yo no veo niñas en ninguna parte--repuso\r\n     Pepe Rey.\r\n\r\n[30] --Hágase usted el anacoreta.\r\n\r\n     Una de las celosías del balcón se abrió, dejando ver un\r\n     rostro juvenil, encantador y risueño, que desapareció al\r\n     instante como una luz apagada por el viento.\r\n\r\n     --Ya, ya veo.\r\n\r\n     --¿No las conoce usted?                                         87\r\n\r\n     --Por mi vida que no.\r\n\r\n     --Son las Troyas, las niñas de Troya. Pues no conoce\r\n     usted nada bueno... Tres chicas preciosísimas, hijas de\r\n[5]  un coronel de Estado Mayor de Plazas, que murió en las\r\n     calles de Madrid el 54.\r\n\r\n     La celosía se abrió de nuevo y comparecieron dos caras.\r\n\r\n     --Se están burlando de nosotros--dijo Tafetán haciendo\r\n     una seña amistosa a las niñas.\r\n\r\n[10] --¿Las conoce usted?\r\n\r\n     --¿Pues no las he de conocer? Las pobres están en la\r\n     miseria. Yo no sé cómo viven. Cuando murió D. Francisco\r\n     Troya, se hizo una suscripción para mantenerlas;\r\n     pero esto duró poco.\r\n\r\n[15] --¡Pobres muchachas! Me figuro que no serán un\r\n     modelo de honradez....\r\n\r\n     --¿Por qué no?... Yo no creo lo que en el pueblo se\r\n     dice de ellas.\r\n\r\n     Funcionó de nuevo la celosía.\r\n\r\n[20] --Buenas tardes, niñas--gritó D. Juan Tafetán dirigiéndose\r\n     a las tres, que artísticamente agrupadas aparecieron.--Este\r\n     caballero dice que lo bueno no debe esconderse, y\r\n     que abran ustedes toda la celosía.\r\n\r\n     Pero la celosía se cerró y alegre concierto de risas difundió\r\n[25] una extraña alegría por la triste calle. Creeríase que\r\n     pasaba una bandada de pájaros.\r\n\r\n     --¿Quiere usted que vayamos allá?--dijo de súbito\r\n     Tafetán.\r\n\r\n     Sus ojos brillaban, y una sonrisa picaresca retozaba en\r\n[30] sus amoratados labios.\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero qué clase de gente es esa?\r\n\r\n     --Ande usted, Sr. de Rey... Las pobrecitas son honradas.\r\n     ¡Bah! Si se alimentan del aire como los camaleones.\r\n     Diga usted, el que no come, ¿puede pecar?\r\n\r\n     Bastante virtuosas son las infelices. Y si pecaran, limpiarían  88\r\n     su conciencia con el gran ayuno que hacen.\r\n\r\n     --Pues vamos.\r\n\r\n     Un momento después, D. Juan Tafetán y Pepe Rey\r\n[5]  entraban en la sala. El aspecto de la miseria, que con\r\n     horribles esfuerzos pugnaba por no serlo, afligió al joven.\r\n     Las tres muchachas eran muy lindas, principalmente las\r\n     dos más pequeñas, morenas, pálidas, de negros ojos y sutil\r\n     talle. Bien vestidas y bien calzadas, habrían parecido\r\n[10] retoños de duquesa en candidatura para entroncar con\r\n     príncipes.\r\n\r\n     Cuando la visita entró, las tres se quedaron muy cortadas;\r\n     pero bien pronto mostraron la índole de su genial frívolo y\r\n     alegre. Vivían en la miseria, como los pájaros en la prisión,\r\n[15] sin dejar de cantar tras los hierros lo mismo que en la\r\n     opulencia del bosque. Pasaban el día cosiendo, lo cual\r\n     indicaba por lo menos un principio de honradez; pero en\r\n     Orbajosa ninguna persona de su posición se trataba con\r\n     ellas. Estaban hasta cierto punto proscritas, degradadas,\r\n[20] acordonadas, lo cual indicaba también algún motivo de\r\n     escándalo. Pero en honor de la verdad, debe decirse que\r\n     la mala reputación de las Troyas consistía, más que nada,\r\n     en su fama de chismosas, enredadoras, traviesas y despreocupadas.\r\n     Dirigían anónimos a graves personas; ponían\r\n[25] motes a todo viviente de Orbajosa, desde el obispo al último\r\n     zascandil; tiraban piedrecitas a los transeuntes; chicheaban\r\n     escondidas tras las rejas para reírse con la confusión y\r\n     azoramiento del que pasaba; sabían todos los sucesos de\r\n     la vecindad, para lo cual tenían en constante uso los tragaluces\r\n[30] y agujeros todos de la parte alta de la casa; cantaban\r\n     de noche en el balcón; se vestían de máscara en Carnaval\r\n     para meterse en las casas más alcurniadas, con otras majaderías\r\n     y libertades propias de los pueblos pequeños. Pero\r\n     cualquiera que fuese la razón, ello es que el graciado triunvirato\r\n     Troyano tenía sobre sí un estigma de esos que una               89\r\n     vez puestos por susceptible vecindario, acompañan implacablemente\r\n     hasta más allá de la tumba.\r\n\r\n     --¿Éste es el caballero que dicen ha venido a sacar\r\n[5]  minas de oro?--dijo una.\r\n\r\n     --¿Y a derribar la catedral para hacer con las piedras\r\n     de ella una fábrica de zapatos?--añadió otra.\r\n\r\n     --Y a quitar de Orbajosa la siembra del ajo para poner\r\n     algodón o el árbol de la canela.\r\n\r\n[10] Pepe no pudo reprimir la risa ante tales despropósitos.\r\n\r\n     --No viene sino a hacer una recolección de niñas bonitas\r\n     para llevárselas a Madrid--dijo Tafetán.\r\n\r\n     --¡Ay! ¡De buena gana me iría!--exclamó una.\r\n\r\n     --A las tres, a las tres me las llevo--afirmó Pepe.--Pero\r\n[15] sepamos una cosa; ¿por qué se reían ustedes de mí\r\n     cuando estaba en la ventana del Casino?\r\n\r\n     Tales palabras fueron la señal de nuevas risas.\r\n\r\n     --Éstas son unas tontas--dijo la mayor.\r\n\r\n     --Fué porque dijimos que usted se merece algo más que\r\n[20] la niña de doña Perfecta.\r\n\r\n     --Fué porque ésta dijo que usted está perdiendo el\r\n     tiempo y que Rosarito no quiere sino gente de iglesia.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué cosas tienes!  Yo no he dicho tal cosa. Tú\r\n     dijiste que este caballero es ateo luterano, y entra en la\r\n[25] catedral fumando y con el sombrero puesto.\r\n\r\n     --Pues yo no lo inventé--manifestó la menor,--que\r\n     eso me lo dijo ayer Suspiritos.\r\n\r\n     --¿Y quién es esa Suspiritos que dice de mí tales tonterías?\r\n\r\n[30] --Suspiritos es... Suspiritos.\r\n\r\n     --Niñas mías--dijo Tafetán con semblante almibarado.\r\n     Por ahí va el naranjero. Llamadle, que os quiero convidar\r\n     a naranjas.\r\n\r\n     Una de las tres llamó al naranjero.\r\n\r\n     La conversación entablada por las niñas desagradó bastante      90\r\n     a Pepe Rey, disipando la ligera impresión de contento\r\n     que experimentó al encontrarse entre aquella chusma\r\n     alegre y comunicativa. No pudo, sin embargo, contener\r\n[5]  la risa cuando vió a D. Juan Tafetán descolgar un guitarrillo\r\n     y rasguearlo con la gracia y destreza de los años\r\n     juveniles.\r\n\r\n     --Me han dicho que ustedes saben cantar a las mil\r\n     maravillas--manifestó Rey.\r\n\r\n[10] --Que cante D. Juan Tafetán.\r\n\r\n     --Yo no canto.\r\n\r\n     --Ni yo--dijo la segunda, ofreciendo al ingeniero\r\n     algunos cascos de la naranja que acababa de mondar.\r\n\r\n     --María Juana, no abandones la costura--dijo la Troya\r\n[15] mayor.--Es tarde y hay que acabar la sotana esta\r\n     noche.\r\n\r\n     --Hoy no se trabaja. Al demonio las agujas--exclamó\r\n     Tafetán.\r\n\r\n     En seguida entonó una canción.\r\n\r\n[20] --La gente se para en la calle--dijo la Troya segunda\r\n     asomándose al balcón.--Los gritos de D. Juan Tafetán se\r\n     oyen desde la plaza... ¡Juana, Juana!\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué?\r\n\r\n     --Por la calle va Suspiritos.\r\n\r\n[25] La más pequeña voló al balcón.\r\n\r\n     --Tírale una cascara de naranja.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey se asomó también; vió que por la calle pasaba\r\n     una señora, y que con diestra puntería la menor de las\r\n     Troyas le asestó un cascarazo en el moño. Después\r\n[30] cerraron precipitadamente, y las tres se esforzaban en\r\n     sofocar convulsamente su risa para que no se oyera desde\r\n     la vía pública.\r\n\r\n     --Hoy no se trabaja--gritó una volcando de un puntapié\r\n     la cesta de la costura.\r\n\r\n     --Es lo mismo que decir, \"mañana no se come\"--añadió            91\r\n     la mayor, recogiendo los enseres.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey se echó instintivamente mano al bolsillo. De\r\n     buena gana les hubiera dado una limosna. El espectáculo\r\n[5]  de aquellas infelices huérfanas, condenadas por el mundo\r\n     a causa de su frivolidad, le entristecía sobre manera. Si el\r\n     único pecado de las Troyas, si el único desahogo con que\r\n     compensaban su soledad, su pobreza y abandono, era tirar\r\n     cortezas de naranja al transeunte, bien se las podía disculpar.\r\n[10] Quizás las austeras costumbres del poblachón en que vivían\r\n     las había preservado del vicio; pero las desgraciadas carecían\r\n     de compostura y comedimiento, fórmula común y más\r\n     visible del pudor, y bien podía suponerse que habían echado\r\n     por la ventana algo más que cáscaras. Pepe Rey sentía\r\n[15] hacia ellas una lástima profunda. Observó sus miserables\r\n     vestidos, compuestos, arreglados y remendados de mil\r\n     modos para que pareciesen nuevos, observó sus zapatos\r\n     rotos... y otra vez se llevó la mano al bolsillo.\r\n\r\n     --Podrá el vicio reinar aquí--dijo para sí;--pero las\r\n[20] fisonomías, los muebles, todo me indica que estos son los\r\n     infelices restos de una familia honrada. Si estas pobres\r\n     muchachas fueran tan malas como dicen, no vivirían tan\r\n     pobremente ni trabajarían. ¡En Orbajosa hay hombres\r\n     ricos!\r\n\r\n[25] Las tres niñas se le acercaban sucesivamente. Iban de\r\n     él al balcón, del balcón a él, sosteniendo conversación\r\n     picante y ligera, que indicaba, fuerza es decirlo, una\r\n     especie de inocencia en medio de tanta frivolidad y\r\n     despreocupación.\r\n\r\n[30] --Sr. D. José, ¡qué excelente señora es doña Perfecta!\r\n\r\n     --Es la única persona de Orbajosa que no tiene apodo,\r\n     la única persona de que no se habla mal en Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     --Todos la respetan.\r\n\r\n     --Todos la adoran.\r\n\r\n     A estas frases el joven respondía con alabanzas de su           92\r\n     tía; pero se le pasaban ganas de sacar dinero del bolsillo y\r\n     decir: \"María Juana, tome usted para unas botas. Pepa,\r\n     tome usted para que se compre un vestido. Florentina,\r\n[5]  tome usted para que coman una semana....\" Estuvo a\r\n     punto de hacerlo como lo pensaba. En un momento en\r\n     que las tres corrieron al balcón para ver quién pasaba, don\r\n     Juan Tafetán se acercó a él y en voz baja le dijo:\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué monas son! ¿No es verdad?... ¡Pobres\r\n[10] criaturas! Parece mentira que sean tan alegres, cuando...\r\n     bien puede asegurarse que hoy no han comido.\r\n\r\n     --Don Juan, D. Juan--gritó Pepilla.--Por ahí viene su\r\n     amigo de usted Nicolasito Hernández, o sea _Cirio Pascual_,\r\n     con su sombrero de tres pisos. Viene rezando en voz baja,\r\n[15] sin duda por las almas de los que ha mandado al hoyo con\r\n     sus usuras.\r\n\r\n     --¿A que no le dicen ustedes el remoquete?\r\n\r\n     --¡A que sí!\r\n\r\n     --Juana, cierra las celosías. Dejémosle que pase, y\r\n[20] cuando vaya por la esquina, yo gritaré: _¡Cirio, Cirio\r\n     Pascual_!...\r\n\r\n     Don Juan Tafetán corrió al balcón.\r\n\r\n     --Venga usted, D. José, para que conozca este tipo.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey aprovechó el momento en que las tres muchachas\r\n[25] y D. Juan se regocijaban en el balcón, llamando a\r\n     Nicolasito Hernández con el apodo que tanto le hacía\r\n     rabiar, y acercándose con toda cautela a uno de los costureros\r\n     que en la sala había, colocó dentro de él media onza\r\n     que le quedaba del juego.\r\n\r\n[30] Después corrió al balcón, a punto que las dos más\r\n     pequeñas gritaban entre locas risas: _¡Cirio Pascual, Cirio\r\n     Pascual!_\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                     93\r\n\r\n                                  XIII\r\n\r\n                            =Un casus belli=\r\n\r\n     Después de esta travesura, las tres entablaron con los\r\n     dos caballeros una conversación tirada sobre asuntos y personas\r\n     de la ciudad. El ingeniero, recelando que su fechoría\r\n     se descubriese, estando él presente, quiso marcharse, lo cual\r\n[5]  disgustó mucho a las Troyas; una de éstas que había salido\r\n     fuera de la sala, regresó diciendo:\r\n\r\n     --Ya está Suspiritos en campaña colgando la ropa.\r\n\r\n     --Don José querrá verla--indicó otra.\r\n\r\n     --Es una señora muy guapa. Y ahora se peina a estilo\r\n[10] de Madrid. Vengan ustedes.\r\n\r\n     Lleváronles al comedor de la casa (pieza de rarísimo uso),\r\n     del cual se salía a un terrado, donde había algunos tiestos\r\n     de flores y no pocos trastos abandonados y hechos pedazos.\r\n     Desde allí veíase el hondo patio de una casa colindante,\r\n[15] con una galería llena de verdes enredaderas y hermosas\r\n     macetas esmeradamente cuidadas. Todo indicaba allí una\r\n     vivienda de gente modesta, pulcra y hacendosa.\r\n\r\n     Las de Troya, acercándose al bordo de la azotea, miraron\r\n     atentamente a la casa vecina, e imponiendo silencio a los\r\n[20] galanes, se retiraron luego a aquella parte del terrado, desde\r\n     donde nada se veía ni había peligro de ser visto.\r\n\r\n     --Ahora sale de la despensa con un cazuelo de garbanzos--dijo\r\n     María Juana, estirando el cuello para ver un\r\n     poco.\r\n\r\n[25] --¡Zás!--exclamó otra, arrojando una piedrecilla.\r\n\r\n     Oyóse el ruido del proyectil al chocar contra los cristales\r\n     de la galería, y luego una colérica voz que gritaba:\r\n\r\n     --Ya nos han roto otro cristal ésas....\r\n\r\n     Ocultas las tres en el rincón del terrado, junto a los dos\r\n[30] caballeros, sofocaban la risa.\r\n\r\n     --La señora Suspiritos está muy incomodada--dijo                94\r\n     Rey.--¿Por qué la llaman así?\r\n\r\n     --Porque siempre que habla suspira entre palabra y\r\n     palabra, y aunque de nada carece siempre se está\r\n[5]  lamentando.\r\n\r\n     Hubo un momento de silencio en la casa de abajo.\r\n     Pepita Troya atisbó con cautela.\r\n\r\n     --Allá viene otra vez--murmuró en voz baja, imponiendo\r\n     silencio.--María, dame una china. A ver... ¡zás!...\r\n[10] allá va.\r\n\r\n     --No la has acertado. Dió en el suelo.\r\n\r\n     --A ver si yo puedo... Esperaremos a que salga otra\r\n     vez de la despensa.\r\n\r\n     --Ya, ya sale. En guardia, Florentina.\r\n\r\n[15] --¡A la una, a las dos, a las tres!... ¡Paf!...\r\n\r\n     Oyóse abajo un grito de dolor, un voto, una exclamación\r\n     varonil, pues era un hombre el que la daba. Pepe Rey\r\n     pudo distinguir claramente estas palabras:\r\n\r\n     --¡Demonche! Me han agujereado la cabeza ésas...\r\n[20] ¡Jacinto, Jacinto! ¿Pero qué canalla de vecindad es\r\n     esta?...\r\n\r\n     --¡Jesús, María y José, lo que he hecho!--exclamó\r\n     llena de consternación Florentina,--le he dado en la\r\n     cabeza al Sr. D. Inocencio.\r\n\r\n[25] --¿Al Penitenciario?--dijo Pepe Rey.\r\n\r\n     --Sí.\r\n\r\n     --¿Vive en esa casa?\r\n\r\n     --¿Pues dónde ha de vivir?\r\n\r\n     --Esa señora de los suspiros....\r\n\r\n[30] --Es su sobrina, su ama o no sé qué. Nos divertimos\r\n     con ella porque es muy cargante, pero con el señor Penitenciario\r\n     no solemos gastar bromas.\r\n\r\n     Mientras rápidamente se pronunciaban las palabras de\r\n     este diálogo, Pepe Rey vió que frente al terrado, y muy\r\n     cerca de él, se abrían los cristales de una ventana\r\n     perteneciente a la misma casa bombardeada; vió que aparecía     95\r\n     une cara risueña, una cara conocida, una cara cuya vista le\r\n     aturdió y le consternó y le puso pálido y trémulo. Era\r\n[5]  Jacintito, que interrumpido en sus graves estudios, abrió\r\n     la ventana de su despacho, presentándose en ella con la\r\n     pluma en la oreja. Su rostro púdico, fresco y sonrosado\r\n     daba a tal aparición aspecto semejante al de una\r\n     aurora.\r\n\r\n[10] --Buenas tardes, Sr. D. José--dijo festivamente.\r\n     La voz de abajo gritaba de nuevo:\r\n\r\n     --¡Jacinto, pero Jacinto!\r\n\r\n     --Allá voy. Estaba saludando a un amigo....\r\n\r\n     --Vámonos, vámonos--gritó Florentina con zozobra.--El\r\n[15] señor Penitenciario va a subir al cuarto de _D. Nominavito_\r\n     y nos echará un responso.\r\n\r\n     --Vámonos, sí; cerremos la puerta del comedor.\r\n\r\n     Abandonaron en tropel el terrado.\r\n\r\n     --Debieron ustedes prever que Jacinto las vería desde\r\n[20] su templo del saber--dijo Tafetán.\r\n\r\n     --_Don Nominavito_ es amigo nuestro--repuso una de\r\n     ellas.--Desde su templo de la ciencia nos dice a la calladita\r\n     mil ternezas, y también nos echa besos volados.\r\n\r\n     --¿Jacinto?--preguntó el ingeniero,--¿qué endiablado\r\n[25] nombre le han puesto ustedes?\r\n\r\n     --_Don Nominavito_....\r\n\r\n     Las tres rompieron a reír.\r\n\r\n     --Lo llamamos así porque es muy sabio.\r\n\r\n     --No: porque cuando nosotras éramos chicas, él era\r\n[30] chico también; pues... sí. Salíamos al terrado a jugar,\r\n     y le sentíamos estudiando en voz alta sus lecciones.\r\n\r\n     --Sí, y todo el santo día estaba cantando.\r\n\r\n     --Declinando, mujer. Eso es: se ponía de este modo:\r\n     _Nominavito rosa, Genivito, Davito, Acusavito_.\r\n\r\n     --Supongo que yo también tendré mi nombre postizo--dijo         96\r\n     Pepe Rey.\r\n\r\n     --Que se lo diga a usted María Juana--replicó Florentina\r\n     ocultándose.\r\n\r\n[5]  --¿Yo?... díselo tú, Pepa.\r\n\r\n     --Usted no tiene nombre todavía, D. José.\r\n\r\n     --Pero lo tendré. Prometo que vendré a saberlo, a\r\n     recibir la confirmación--dijo el joven con intención de\r\n     retirarse.\r\n\r\n[10] --¿Pero se va usted?\r\n\r\n     --Sí. Ya han perdido ustedes bastante tiempo. Niñas,\r\n     a trabajar. Esto de arrojar piedras a los vecinos y a los\r\n     transeuntes, no es la ocupación más a propósito para unas\r\n     jóvenes tan lindas y de tanto mérito... Con que abur....\r\n\r\n[15] Y sin esperar más razones ni hacer caso de los cumplidos\r\n     de las muchachas, salió a toda prisa de la casa, dejando en\r\n     ella a don Juan Tafetán.\r\n\r\n     La escena que había presenciado; la vejación sufrida por\r\n[20] el canónigo; la inopinada aparición del doctorcillo, aumentaron\r\n     las confusiones, recelos y presentimientos desagradables\r\n     que turbaban el alma del pobre ingeniero. Deploró\r\n     con toda su alma haber entrado en casa de las Troyas, y\r\n     resuelto a emplear mejor el tiempo, mientras su hipocondría\r\n     le durase, recorrió las calles de la población.\r\n\r\n[25] Visitó el mercado, la calle de la Tripería, donde estaban\r\n     las principales tiendas; observó los diversos aspectos que\r\n     ofrecían la industria y comercio de la gran Orbajosa, y\r\n     como no hallara sino nuevos motivos de aburrimiento,\r\n     encaminóse al paseo de las Descalzas; pero no vió en él\r\n[30] más que algunos perros vagabundos, porque con motivo del\r\n     viento molestísimo que reinaba, caballeros y señoras se\r\n     habían quedado en sus casas. Fué a la botica, donde\r\n     hacían tertulia diversas especies de progresistas rumiantes,\r\n     que estaban perpetuamente masticando un tema sin fin;\r\n     pero allí se aburrió más. Pasaba al fin junto a la catedral,    97\r\n     cuando sintió el órgano y los hermosos cantos del coro.\r\n     Entró, arrodillóse delante del altar mayor, recordando las\r\n     advertencias que acerca de la compostura dentro de la\r\n[5]  iglesia le hiciera su tía; visitó luego una capilla, y se disponía\r\n     a entrar en otra, cuando un acólito, celador o perrero\r\n     se le acercó, y con modales muy descorteses y descompuesto\r\n     lenguaje, le habló así:\r\n\r\n     --Su Ilustrísima dice que se plante usted en la calle.\r\n\r\n[10] El ingeniero sintió que la sangre se agolpaba en su cerebro.\r\n     Sin decir una palabra obedeció. Arrojado de todas\r\n     partes por fuerza superior o por su propio hastío, no tenía\r\n     más recurso que ir a casa de su tía, donde le esperaban:\r\n\r\n     1.° El tío Licurgo, para anunciarle un segundo pleito.\r\n[15] 2.° El Sr. D. Cayetano, para leerle un nuevo trozo de su\r\n     discurso sobre los linajes de Orbajosa. 3.° Caballuco,\r\n     para un asunto que no había manifestado. 4.° Doña\r\n     Perfecta y su sonrisa bondadosa, para lo que se verá en el\r\n     capítulo siguiente.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XIV\r\n\r\n                     =La discordia sigue creciendo=\r\n\r\n[20] Una nueva tentativa de ver a su prima Rosario fracasó\r\n     al caer de la tarde. Pepe Rey se encerró en su cuarto para\r\n     escribir varias cartas, y no podía apartar de su mente una\r\n     idea fija.\r\n\r\n     --Esta noche o mañana--decía,--se acabará esto de\r\n[25] una manera o de otra.\r\n\r\n     Cuando le llamaron para la cena, doña Perfecta se dirigió\r\n     a él en el comedor, diciéndole de buenas a primeras:\r\n\r\n     --Querido Pepe, no te apures, yo aplacaré al Sr. D.\r\n     Inocencio... Ya estoy enterada. María Remedios, que\r\n[30] acaba de salir de aquí, me lo ha contado todo.\r\n\r\n     El semblante de la señora irradiaba satisfacción, semejante     98\r\n     a la de un artista orgulloso de su obra.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué?\r\n\r\n     --Yo te disculparé, hombre. Tomarías algunas copas\r\n[5]  en el Casino, ¿no es esto? He aquí el resultado de las\r\n     malas compañías. ¡D. Juan Tafetán, las Troyas!...\r\n     Esto es horrible, espantoso. ¿Has meditado bien?...\r\n\r\n     --Todo lo he meditado, señora--repuso Pepe, decidido\r\n     a no entrar en discusiones con su tía.\r\n\r\n[10] --Me guardaré muy bien de escribirle a tu padre lo que\r\n     has hecho.\r\n\r\n     --Puede usted escribirle lo que guste.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos: te defenderás desmintiéndome.\r\n\r\n     --Yo no desmiento.\r\n\r\n[15] --Luégo confiesas que estuviste en casa de esas....\r\n\r\n     --Estuve.\r\n\r\n     --Y que les diste media onza, porque, según me ha dicho\r\n     María Remedios, esta tarde bajó Florentina a la tienda del\r\n     extremeño a que le cambiaran media onza. Ellas no podían\r\n[20] haberla ganado con su costura. Tú estuviste hoy en casa\r\n     de ellas; luégo....\r\n\r\n     --Luégo yo se la di. Perfectamente.\r\n\r\n     --¿No lo niegas?\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué he de negarlo! Creo que puedo hacer de mi\r\n[25] dinero lo que mejor me convenga.\r\n\r\n     --Pero de seguro sostendrás que no apedreaste al señor\r\n     Penitenciario.\r\n\r\n     --Yo no apedreo.\r\n\r\n     --Quiero decir que ellas en presencia tuya....\r\n\r\n[30] --Eso es otra cosa.\r\n\r\n     --E insultaron a la pobre María Remedios.\r\n\r\n     --Tampoco lo niego.\r\n\r\n     --¿Y cómo justificarás tu conducta? Pepe... por Dios.--No\r\n     dices nada; no te arrepientes, no protestas... no....\r\n\r\n     --Nada, absolutamente nada, señora.                             99\r\n\r\n     --Ni siquiera procuras desagraviarme.\r\n\r\n     --Yo no he agraviado a usted....\r\n\r\n     --- Vamos, ya no te falta más que... Hombre, coge\r\n[5]  ese palo y pégame.\r\n\r\n     --Yo no pego.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué falta de respeto! ¡qué!... ¿No cenas?\r\n\r\n     --Cenaré.\r\n\r\n     Hubo una pausa de más de un cuarto de hora. D. Cayetano,\r\n[10] doña Perfecta y Pepe Rey comían en silencio. Éste\r\n     se interrumpió cuando D. Inocencio entró en el comedor.\r\n\r\n     --¡Cuánto lo he sentido, Sr. D. José de mi alma!...\r\n     Créame usted que lo he sentido de veras--dijo estrechando\r\n     la mano al joven y mirándole con expresión de lástima.\r\n\r\n[15] El ingeniero no supo qué contestar; tanta era su\r\n     confusión.\r\n\r\n     --Me refiero al suceso de esta tarde.\r\n\r\n     --¡Ah!... ya.\r\n\r\n     --A la expulsión de usted del sagrado recinto de la\r\n[20] iglesia catedral.\r\n\r\n     --El señor obispo--dijo Pepe Rey,--debía pensarlo\r\n     mucho antes de arrojar a un cristiano de la iglesia.\r\n\r\n     --Y es verdad, yo no sé quién le ha metido en la cabeza\r\n     a Su Ilustrísima que usted es hombre de malísimas costumbres;\r\n[25] yo no sé quién le ha dicho que usted hace alarde de\r\n     ateísmo en todas partes; que se burla de las cosas y personas\r\n     sagradas, y aun que proyecta derribar la catedral\r\n     para edificar con sus piedras una gran fábrica de alquitrán.\r\n     Yo he procurado disuadirle; pero Su Ilustrísima es un poco\r\n[30] terco.\r\n\r\n     --Gracias por tanta bondad.\r\n\r\n     --Y eso que el señor Penitenciario no tiene motivos para\r\n     guardarte tales consideraciones. Por poco más le dejan en\r\n     el sitio esta tarde.\r\n\r\n     --¡Bah!... ¿pues qué?--dijo el sacerdote riendo.--¿Ya          100\r\n     se tiene aquí noticia de la travesurilla?... Apuesto\r\n     a que María Remedios vino con el cuento. Pues se lo\r\n     prohibí, se lo prohibí de un modo terminante. La cosa en\r\n[5]  sí no vale la pena, ¿no es verdad, Sr. de Rey?\r\n\r\n     --Puesto que usted lo juzga así....\r\n\r\n     --Ése es mi parecer. Cosas de muchachos... La\r\n     juventud, digan lo que quieran los modernos, se inclina\r\n     al vicio y a las acciones viciosas. El Sr. D. José, que es\r\n     una persona de grandes prendas, no podía ser perfecto...\r\n     ¿qué tiene de particular que esas graciosas niñas le sedujeran,\r\n     y después de sacarle el dinero le hicieran cómplice\r\n     de sus desvergonzados y criminales insultos a la vecindad?\r\n     Querido amigo mío, por la dolorosa parte que me cupo en\r\n[15] los juegos de esta tarde--añadió, llevándose la mano a la\r\n     región lastimada,--no me doy por ofendido, ni siquiera\r\n     mortificaré a usted con recuerdos de tan desagradable incidente.\r\n     He sentido verdadera pena al saber que María\r\n     Remedios había venido a contarlo todo... Es tan chismosa\r\n[20] mi sobrina... Apostamos a que también contó lo\r\n     de la media onza, y los retozos de usted con las niñas en el\r\n     tejado, y las carreras y pellizcos, y el bailoteo de D. Juan\r\n     Tafetán... ¡Bah! estas cosas debieran quedarse en\r\n     secreto.\r\n\r\n[25] Pepe Rey no sabía lo que le mortificaba más, si la severidad\r\n     de su tía o las hipócritas condescendencias del\r\n     canónigo.\r\n\r\n     --¿Por qué no se han de decir?--indicó la señora.--Él\r\n     mismo no parece avergonzado de su conducta. Sépanlo\r\n[30] todos. Únicamente se guardará secreto de esto a mi querida\r\n     hija, porque en su estado nervioso son temibles los\r\n     accesos de cólera.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, que no es para tanto, señora--añadió el Penitenciario.--Mi\r\n     opinión es que no se vuelva a hablar del\r\n     asunto, y cuando esto lo dice el que recibió la pedrada, los   101\r\n     demás pueden darse por satisfechos... Y no fué broma\r\n     lo del trastazo, Sr. D. José, pues creí que me abrían un\r\n     boquete en el casco y que se me salían por él los sesos....\r\n\r\n[5]  --¡Cuánto siento este incidente!...--balbució Pepe\r\n     Rey.--Me causa verdadera pena, a pesar de no haber\r\n     tomado parte....\r\n\r\n     --La visita de usted a esas señoras Troyas llamará la\r\n     atención en el pueblo--dijo el canónigo.--Aquí no estamos\r\n[10] en Madrid, señores, aquí no estamos en ese centro de\r\n     corrupción, de escándalo....\r\n\r\n     --Allá puedes visitar los lugares más inmundos--manifestó\r\n     doña Perfecta,--sin que nadie lo sepa.\r\n\r\n     --Aquí nos miramos mucho--prosiguió D. Inocencio.--Reparamos\r\n[15] todo lo que hacen los vecinos, y con tal sistema\r\n     de vigilancia, la moral pública se sostiene a conveniente\r\n     altura... Créame usted, amigo mío, créame usted, y no\r\n     digo esto por mortificarle; usted ha sido el primer caballero\r\n     de su posición que a la luz del día... el primero, sí señor\r\n[20] ... _Trojae qui primus ab oris_.\r\n\r\n     Después se echó a reír, dando algunas palmadas en la\r\n     espalda al ingeniero en señal de amistad y benevolencia.\r\n\r\n     --¡Cuán grato es para mí--dijo el joven, encubriendo\r\n     su cólera con las palabras que creyó más propias para contestar\r\n[25] a la solapada ironía de sus interlocutores,--ver tanta\r\n     generosidad y tolerancia, cuando yo merecía por mi\r\n     criminal proceder!....\r\n\r\n     --¿Pues qué? A un individuo que es de nuestra propia\r\n     sangre y que lleva nuestro mismo nombre--dijo doña Perfecta,--¿se\r\n[30] le puede tratar como a un cualquiera? Eres\r\n     mi sobrino, eres hijo del mejor y más santo de los hombres,\r\n     mi querido hermano Juan, y esto basta. Ayer tarde estuvo\r\n     aquí el secretario del señor obispo, a manifestarme que Su\r\n     Ilustrísima está muy disgustado porque te tengo en mi casa.\r\n\r\n     --¿También eso?--murmuró el canónigo.                          102\r\n\r\n     --También eso. Yo dije que, salvo el respeto que el\r\n     señor obispo me merece y lo mucho que le quiero y reverencio,\r\n     mi sobrino es mi sobrino, y no puedo echarle de mi\r\n[5]  casa.\r\n\r\n     --Es una nueva singularidad que encuentro en este país--dijo\r\n     Pepe Rey, pálido de ira.--Por lo visto, aquí el\r\n     obispo gobierna las casas ajenas.\r\n\r\n     --Él es un bendito. Me quiere tanto, que se le figura\r\n[10] ... se le figura que nos vas a comunicar tu ateísmo, tu\r\n     despreocupación, tus raras ideas... Yo le he dicho repetidas\r\n     veces que tienes un fondo excelente.\r\n\r\n     --Al talento superior debe siempre concedérsele algo--manifestó\r\n     D. Inocencio.\r\n\r\n[15] --Y esta mañana, cuando estuve en casa de las de Cirujeda,\r\n     ¡ay! tú no puedes figurarte cómo me pusieron la\r\n     cabeza... Que si habías venido a derribar la catedral;\r\n     que si eras comisionado de los protestantes ingleses para ir\r\n     predicando la herejía por España; que pasabas la noche\r\n[20] entera jugando en el Casino; que salías borracho...\r\n     \"Pero señoras--les dije,--¿quieren ustedes que yo envíe\r\n     a mi sobrino a la posada?\" Además, en lo de las embriagueces\r\n     no tienen razón, y en cuanto al juego, no sé que\r\n     jugaras hasta hoy.\r\n\r\n[25] Pepe Rey se hallaba en esa situación de ánimo en que el\r\n     hombre más prudente siente dentro de sí violentos ardores\r\n     y una fuerza ciega y brutal que tiende a estrangular, abofetear,\r\n     romper cráneos y machacar huesos. Pero doña\r\n     Perfecta era señora y además su tía, D. Inocencio era\r\n[30] anciano y sacerdote. Además de esto las violencias de\r\n     obra son de mal gusto e impropias de personas cristianas\r\n     y bien educadas. Quedaba el recurso de dar libertad a su\r\n     comprimido encono por medio de la palabra manifestada\r\n     decorosamente y sin faltarse a sí mismo; pero aun le pareció\r\n     prematuro este postrer recurso, que no debía emplear,          103\r\n     según su juicio, hasta el instante de salir definitivamente de\r\n     aquella casa y de Orbajosa. Resistiendo, pues, el furibundo\r\n     ataque, aguardó.\r\n\r\n[5]  Jacinto llegó cuando la cena concluía.\r\n\r\n     --Buenas noches, Sr. D. José...--dijo, estrechando\r\n     la mano del joven.--Usted y sus amigas no me han dejado\r\n     trabajar esta tarde. No he podido escribir una línea.¡Y\r\n     tenía que hacer!...\r\n\r\n[10] --¡Cuánto lo siento, Jacinto! Pues, según me dijeron,\r\n     usted las acompaña algunas veces en sus juegos y retozos.\r\n\r\n     --¡Yo!--exclamó el rapaz, poniéndose como la grana.--¡Bah!\r\n     bien sabe usted que Tafetán no dice nunca palabra\r\n     de verdad... ¿Pero es cierto, Sr. de Rey, que se\r\n[15] marcha usted?\r\n\r\n     --¿Lo dicen por ahí?...\r\n\r\n     --Sí; lo he oído en el Casino, en casa de D. Lorenzo\r\n     Ruiz.\r\n\r\n     Rey contempló durante un rato las frescas facciones de\r\n[20] _D. Nominavito_. Después dijo:\r\n\r\n     --Pues no es cierto. Mi tía está muy contenta de mí;\r\n     desprecia las calumnias con que me están obsequiando los\r\n     orbajosenses... y no me arrojará de su casa, aunque en\r\n     ello se empeñe el señor obispo.\r\n\r\n[25] --Lo que es arrojarte... jamás. ¡Qué diría tu\r\n     padre!...\r\n\r\n     --A pesar de sus bondades, queridísima tía, a pesar de\r\n     la amistad cordial del señor canónigo, quizás decida yo\r\n     marcharme....\r\n\r\n[30] --¡Marcharte!\r\n\r\n     --¡Marcharse usted!\r\n\r\n     En los ojos de doña Perfecta brilló una luz singular. El\r\n     canónigo, a pesar de ser hombre muy experto en el disimulo,\r\n     no pudo ocultar su júbilo.\r\n\r\n     --Sí; y tal vez esta misma noche....                           104\r\n\r\n     --¡Pero hombre, qué arrebatado eres!... ¿Por qué\r\n     no esperas siquiera a mañana temprano?... A ver...\r\n     Juan, que vayan a llamar al tío Licurgo para que prepare\r\n[5]  la jaca.... Supongo que llevarás algún fiambre....\r\n     ¡Nicolasa!... ese pedazo de ternera que está en el\r\n     aparador.... Librada, la ropa del señorito....\r\n\r\n     --No, no puedo creer que usted tome determinación tan\r\n     brusca--dijo D. Cayetano, creyéndose obligado a tomar\r\n[10] alguna parte en aquella cuestión.\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero volverá usted... no es eso?--preguntó el\r\n     canónigo.\r\n\r\n     --¿A qué hora pasa el tren de la mañana?--preguntó\r\n     doña Perfecta, por cuyos ojos claramente asomaba la febril\r\n[15] impaciencia de su altura.\r\n\r\n     --Sí, me marcho esta misma noche.\r\n\r\n     --Pero hombre, si no hay luna.\r\n\r\n     En el alma de doña Perfecta, en el alma del Penitenciario,\r\n     en la juvenil alma del doctorcillo retumbaron como una\r\n[20] armonía celeste estas palabras: \"esta misma noche.\"\r\n\r\n     --Por supuesto, querido Pepe, tú volverás.... Yo he\r\n     escrito hoy a tu padre, a tu excelente padre....--exclamó\r\n     doña Perfecta, con todos los síntomas fisiognómicos que\r\n     aparecen cuando se va a derramar una lágrima.\r\n\r\n[25] --Molestaré a usted con algunos encargos--manifestó\r\n     el sabio.\r\n\r\n     --Buena ocasión para pedir el cuaderno que me falta de\r\n     la obra del abate Gaume--indicó el abogadejo.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, Pepe, que tienes unos arrebatos y unas salidas--murmuró\r\n[30] la señora sonriendo, con la vista fija en la\r\n     puerta del comedor.--Pero se me olvidaba decirte que\r\n     Caballuco está esperando para hablarte.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    105\r\n\r\n                                   XV\r\n\r\n           =Sigue creciendo, hasta que se declara la guerra=\r\n\r\n     Todos miraron hacia la puerta, donde apareció la imponente\r\n     figura del Centauro, serio, cejijunto, confuso al querer\r\n     saludar con amabilidad, hermosamente salvaje, pero\r\n     desfigurado por la violencia que hacía para sonreír urbanamente\r\n[5]  y pisar quedo y tener en correcta postura los hercúleos\r\n     brazos.\r\n\r\n     --Adelante, Sr. Ramos--dijo Pepe Rey.\r\n\r\n     --Pero no--objetó doña Perfecta.--Si es una tontería\r\n     lo que tiene que decirte.\r\n\r\n[10] --Que lo diga.\r\n\r\n     --Yo no debo consentir que en mi casa se ventilen estas\r\n     cuestiones ridículas....\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué quiere de mí el Sr. Ramos?\r\n\r\n     Caballuco pronunció algunas palabras.\r\n\r\n[15] --Basta, basta... exclamó doña Perfecta, riendo.--No\r\n     molestes más a mi sobrino. Pepe, no hagas caso de ese\r\n     majadero.... ¿Quieren ustedes que les diga en qué\r\n     consiste el enojo del gran Caballuco?\r\n\r\n     --¿Enojo? Ya me lo figuro--indicó el Penitenciario,\r\n[20] recostándose en el sillón y riendo expansivamente y con\r\n     estrépito.\r\n\r\n     --Yo quería decirle al Sr. D. José....--gruñó el formidable\r\n     ginete.\r\n\r\n     --Hombre, calla por Dios, no nos aporrees los oídos.\r\n\r\n[25] --Sr. Caballuco--dijo el canónigo,--no es mucho que\r\n     los señores de la Corte desbanquen a los rudos caballistas\r\n     de estas salvajes tierras....\r\n\r\n     --En dos palabras, Pepe, la cuestión es esta. Caballuco\r\n     es no sé qué....\r\n\r\n[30] La risa le impidió continuar.\r\n\r\n     --No sé qué--añadió D. Inocencio,--de una de las              106\r\n     niñas de Troya, de Mariquita Juana, si no estoy equivocado.\r\n\r\n     --¡Y está celoso! Después de su caballo, lo primero\r\n     de la Creación es Mariquilla Troya.\r\n\r\n[5]  --¡Bonito apunte!--exclamó la señora.--¡Pobre\r\n     Cristóbal! ¿Has creído que una persona como mi sobrino?...\r\n     Vamos a ver, ¿qué ibas a decirle? Habla.\r\n\r\n     --Ya hablaremos el Sr. D. José y yo--repuso\r\n     bruscamente el bravo de la localidad.\r\n\r\n[10] Y sin decir más se retiró.\r\n\r\n     Poco después Pepe Rey salió del comedor para ir a su\r\n     cuarto. En la galería hallóse frente a frente con su troyano\r\n     antagonista, y no pudo reprimir la risa al ver la torva seriedad\r\n     del ofendido cortejo.\r\n\r\n[15] --Una palabra--dijo éste plantándose descaradamente\r\n     ante el ingeniero.--¿Usted sabe quién soy yo?\r\n\r\n     Diciendo esto puso la pesada mano en el hombro del\r\n     joven con tan insolente franqueza, que éste no pudo menos\r\n     de rechazarle enérgicamente.\r\n\r\n[20] --No es preciso aplastar para eso.\r\n\r\n     El valentón, ligeramente desconcertado, se repuso al\r\n     instante, y mirando a Rey con audacia provocativa, repitió\r\n     su estribillo.\r\n\r\n     --¿Sabe usted quién soy yo?\r\n\r\n[25] --Sí: ya sé que es usted un animal.\r\n\r\n     Apartóle bruscamente hacia un lado y entró en su cuarto.\r\n     Según el estado del cerebro de nuestro desgraciado amigo\r\n     en aquel instante, sus acciones debían sintetizarse en el\r\n     siguiente brevísimo y definitivo plan: romperle la cabeza a\r\n[30] Caballuco sin pérdida de tiempo; despedirse en seguida de\r\n     su tía con razones severas, aunque corteses, que le llegaran\r\n     al alma; dar un frío adiós al canónigo y un abrazo al inofensivo\r\n     D. Cayetano; administrar, por fin de fiesta, una\r\n     paliza al tío Licurgo; partir de Orbajosa aquella misma\r\n     noche y sacudirse el polvo de los zapatos a la salida de la    107\r\n     ciudad.\r\n\r\n     Pero los pensamientos del perseguido joven no podían\r\n     apartarse, en medio de tantas amarguras, de otro\r\n[5]  desgraciado ser a quien suponía en situación más aflictiva y\r\n     angustiosa que la suya propia. Tras el ingeniero entró en la\r\n     estancia una criada.\r\n\r\n     --¿Le diste mi recado?--preguntó él.\r\n\r\n     --Sí, señor, y me dió esto.\r\n\r\n[10] Rey tomó de las manos de la muchacha un pedacito de\r\n     periódico, en cuyo margen leyó estas palabras: \"Dicen que\r\n     te vas. Yo me muero.\"\r\n\r\n     Cuando volvió al comedor, el tío Licurgo se asomaba a\r\n     la puerta preguntando:\r\n\r\n[15] --¿A qué hora hace falta la jaca?\r\n\r\n     --A ninguna--contestó vivamente Rey.\r\n\r\n     --¿Luégo no te vas esta noche?--dijo doña Perfecta.--Mejor\r\n     es que lo dejes para mañana.\r\n\r\n     --Tampoco.\r\n\r\n[20] --¿Pues cuándo?\r\n\r\n     --Ya veremos--dijo fríamente el joven mirando a su\r\n     tía con imperturbable calma.--Por ahora no pienso\r\n     marcharme.\r\n\r\n     Sus ojos lanzaban enérgico reto.\r\n\r\n[25] Doña Perfecta se puso primero encendida, pálida después.\r\n     Miró al canónigo que se había quitado las gafas de oro para\r\n     limpiarlas, y luego clavó sucesivamente la vista en los\r\n     demás que ocupaban la estancia, incluso Caballuco que,\r\n     entrando poco antes, se sentara en el borde de una silla.\r\n[30] Doña Perfecta les miró como mira un general a sus queridos\r\n     cuerpos de ejército. Después examinó el semblante\r\n     meditabundo y sereno de su sobrino, de aquel estratégico\r\n     enemigo que se presentaba de improviso cuando se le creía en\r\n     vergonzosa fuga.\r\n\r\n     ¡Ay! ¡Sangre, ruina y desolación!... Una gran                  108\r\n     batalla se preparaba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI\r\n\r\n                                =Noche=\r\n\r\n     Orbajosa dormía. Los mustios farolillos del público\r\n     alumbrado despedían en encrucijadas y callejones su postrer\r\n[5]  fulgor como cansados ojos que no pueden vencer el sueño.\r\n     A su débil luz se escurrían envueltos en sus capas los vagabundos,\r\n     los rondadores, los jugadores. Sólo el graznar del\r\n     borracho o el canto del enamorado turbaban la callada paz\r\n     de la ciudad histórica. De pronto el _Ave María Purísima_\r\n[10] de vinoso sereno sonaba como un quejido enfermizo del\r\n     durmiente poblachón.\r\n\r\n     En la casa de doña Perfecta también había silencio.\r\n     Turbábalo tan sólo un diálogo que en la biblioteca del Sr.\r\n     D. Cayetano sostenían éste y Pepe Rey. Sentábase el\r\n[15] erudito reposadamente en el sillón de su mesa de estudio,\r\n     la cual aparecía cubierta por diversas suertes de papeles,\r\n     conteniendo notas, apuntes y referencias, sin que el más\r\n     pequeño desorden las confundiese, a pesar de su mucha\r\n     diversidad y abundancia. Rey fijaba los ojos en el copioso\r\n[20] montón de papeles; pero sus pensamientos volaban sin\r\n     duda en regiones muy distantes de aquella sabiduría.\r\n\r\n     --Perfecta--dijo el anticuario,--aunque es una mujer\r\n     excelente, tiene el defecto de escandalizarse por cualquier\r\n     acción frívola e insignificante. Amigo, en estos pueblos de\r\n[25] provincia el menor desliz se paga caro. Nada encuentro\r\n     de particular en que usted fuese a casa de las Troyas. Se\r\n     me figura que D. Inocencio, bajo su capita de hombre de\r\n     bien, es algo cizañoso. ¿A él qué le importa?...\r\n\r\n     --Hemos llegado a un punto, Sr. D. Cayetano, en que\r\n[30] es preciso tomar una determinación enérgica. Yo necesito\r\n     ver y hablar a Rosario.\r\n\r\n     --Pues véala usted.                                            109\r\n\r\n     --Es que no me dejan--respondió el ingeniero dando\r\n     un puñetazo en la mesa.--Rosario está secuestrada....\r\n\r\n     --¡Secuestrada!--exclamó el sabio con incredulidad.--La\r\n[5]  verdad es que no me gusta su cara, ni su aspecto, ni\r\n     menos el estupor que se pinta en sus bellos ojos. Está\r\n     triste, habla poco, llora.... Amigo D. José, me temo\r\n     mucho que esa niña se vea atacada de la terrible enfermedad\r\n     que ha hecho tantas víctimas en los individuos de mi\r\n[10] familia.\r\n\r\n     --¡Una terrible enfermedad! ¿Cuál?\r\n\r\n     --La locura... mejor dicho, manías. En mi familia\r\n     no ha habido uno solo que se librara de ellas. Yo, yo soy\r\n     el único que he logrado escapar.\r\n\r\n[15] --¡Usted!... Dejando a un lado las manías--dijo Rey\r\n     con impaciencia,--yo quiero ver a Rosario.\r\n\r\n     --Nada más natural. Pero el aislamiento en que su\r\n     madre la tiene es un sistema higiénico, querido Pepe, el\r\n     único sistema que se ha empleado con éxito en todos los\r\n[20] individuos de mi familia. Considere usted que la persona\r\n     cuya presencia y voz debe de hacer más impresión en el\r\n     delicado sistema nervioso de Rosarillo, es el elegido de su\r\n     corazón.\r\n\r\n     --A pesar de todo--insistió Pepe,--yo quiero verla.\r\n\r\n[25] --Quizás Perfecta no se oponga a ello--dijo el sabio\r\n     fijando la atención en sus notas y papeles.--No quiero\r\n     meterme en camisa de once varas.\r\n\r\n     El ingeniero, viendo que no podía sacar partido del buen\r\n     Polentinos, se retiró para marcharse.\r\n\r\n[30] --Usted va a trabajar, y no quiero estorbarle.\r\n\r\n     --No; aún tengo tiempo. Vea usted el cúmulo de\r\n     preciosos datos que he reunido hoy. Atienda usted.... \"En\r\n     1537 un vecino de Orbajosa, llamado Bartolomé del Hoyo,\r\n     fué a Civita-Vecchia en las galeras del Marqués de Castel\r\n     Rodrigo.\" Otra. \"En el mismo año dos hermanos, hijos           110\r\n     también de Orbajosa y llamados Juan y Rodrigo González\r\n     del Arco, se embarcaron en los seis navíos que salieron de\r\n     Maestrique el 20 de Febrero y que a la altura de Calais\r\n[5]  toparon con un navío inglés y los flamencos que mandaba\r\n     Van-Owen....\" En fin, fué aquello una importante hazaña\r\n     de nuestra marina. He descubierto que un orbajosense,\r\n     un tal Mateo Díaz Coronel, alférez de la Guardia, fué el\r\n     que escribió en 1709 y dió a la estampa en Valencia el\r\n[10] _Métrico encomio, fúnebre canto, lírico elogio, descripción\r\n     numérica, gloriosas fatigas, angustiadas glorias de la Reina de los\r\n     Ángeles._ Poseo un preciosísimo ejemplar de esta obra, que\r\n     vale un Perú.... Otro orbajosense es autor de aquel\r\n     famoso _Tractado de las diversas suertes de la Gineta_, que\r\n[15] enseñé a usted ayer, y, en resumen, no doy un paso por el\r\n     laberinto de la historia inédita sin tropezar con algún\r\n     paisano ilustre. Yo pienso sacar todos esos nombres de la\r\n     injusta obscuridad y olvido en que yacen. ¡Qué goce tan\r\n     puro, querido Pepe, es devolver todo su lustre a las glorias,\r\n[20] ora épicas, ora literarias del país en que hemos nacido!\r\n     Ni qué mejor empleo puede dar un hombre al escaso entendimiento\r\n     que del cielo recibiera, a la fortuna heredada y al\r\n     tiempo breve con que puede contar en el mundo la más\r\n     dilatada existencia.... Gracias a mí, se verá que Orbajosa\r\n[25] es ilustre cuna del genio español. Pero ¿qué digo? ¿No\r\n     se conoce bien su prosapia ilustre en la nobleza, en la\r\n     hidalguía de la actual generación _urbsaugustana_? Pocas\r\n     localidades conocemos en que crezcan con más lozanía las\r\n     plantas y arbustos de todas las virtudes, libres de la maléfica\r\n[30] hierba de los vicios. Aquí todo es paz, mutuo respeto,\r\n     humildad cristiana. La caridad se practica aquí como en\r\n     los tiempos evangélicos; aquí no se conoce la envidia;\r\n     aquí no se conocen las pasiones criminales, y si oye usted\r\n     hablar de ladrones y asesinos, tenga por seguro que no son\r\n     hijos de esta noble tierra, o que pertenecen al número de      111\r\n     los infelices pervertidos por las predicaciones demagógicas.\r\n     Aquí verá usted el carácter nacional en toda su pureza,\r\n     recto, hidalgo, incorruptible, puro, sencillo, patriarcal,\r\n[5]  hospitalario, generoso.... Por eso gusto tanto vivir en esta\r\n     pacífica soledad, lejos del laberinto de las ciudades, donde\r\n     reinan ¡ay! la falsedad y el vicio. Por eso no han podido\r\n     sacarme de aquí los muchos amigos que tengo en Madrid;\r\n     por eso vivo en la dulce compañía de mis leales paisanos y\r\n[10] de mis libros, respirando sin cesar esta salutífera atmósfera\r\n     de honradez, que se va poco a poco reduciendo en nuestra\r\n     España, y sólo existe en las humildes y cristianas ciudades\r\n     que con las emanaciones de sus virtudes saben conservarla.\r\n     Y no crea usted, este sosegado aislamiento ha contribuído\r\n[15] mucho, queridísimo Pepe, a librarme de la terrible\r\n     enfermedad connaturalizada en mi familia. En mi juventud yo,\r\n     lo mismo que mis hermanos y padre, padecía lamentable\r\n     propensión a las más absurdas manías; pero aquí me tiene\r\n     usted tan pasmosamente curado, que no conozco tal enfermedad\r\n[20] sino cuando la veo en los demás. Por eso mi\r\n     sobrinilla me tiene tan inquieto.\r\n\r\n     --Celebro que los aires de Orbajosa le hayan preservado\r\n     a usted--dijo Rey, no pudiendo reprimir un sentimiento\r\n     de burlas que por ley extraña nació en medio de su tristeza.--A\r\n[25] mí me han probado tan mal, que creo he de ser\r\n     maniático dentro de poco tiempo si sigo aquí. Con que buenas\r\n     noches, y que trabaje usted mucho.\r\n\r\n     --Buenas noches.\r\n\r\n     Dirigióse a su habitación; mas no sintiendo sueño ni\r\n[30] necesidad de reposo físico, sino por el contrario, fuerte\r\n     excitación que le impulsaba a agitarse y divagar, cavilando\r\n     y moviéndose, se paseó de un ángulo a otro de la pieza.\r\n     Después abrió la ventana que daba a la huerta, y poniendo\r\n     los codos en el antepecho de ella, contempló la inmensa\r\n     negrura de la noche. No se veía nada. Pero el hombre           112\r\n     ensimismado lo ve todo, y Rey, fijos los ojos en la\r\n     obscuridad, miraba cómo se iba desarrollando sobre ella el\r\n     abigarrado paisaje de sus desgracias. La sombra no le permitía\r\n[5]  ver las flores de la tierra, ni las del cielo, que son las\r\n     estrellas. La misma falta casi absoluta de claridad\r\n     producía el efecto de un ilusorio movimiento en las masas de\r\n     árboles, que se extendían al parecer, iban perezosamente y\r\n     regresaban enroscándose, como el oleaje de un mar de\r\n[10] sombras. Formidable flujo y reflujo, una lucha entre\r\n     fuerzas no bien manifiestas, agitaban la silenciosa esfera.\r\n     El matemático, contemplando aquella extraña proyección\r\n     de su alma sobre la noche, decía:\r\n\r\n     --La batalla será terrible. Veremos quién sale\r\n[15] triunfante.\r\n\r\n     Los insectos de la noche hablaron a su oído, diciéndole\r\n     misteriosas palabras. Aquí un chirrido áspero; allí un\r\n     chasquido semejante al que hacemos con la lengua; allá\r\n     lastimeros murmullos; más lejos un son vibrante parecido\r\n[20] al de la esquila suspendida al cuello de la res vagabunda.\r\n     De súbito sintió Rey una consonante extraña, una rápida\r\n     nota propia tan sólo de la lengua y de los labios humanos.\r\n     Esta exhalación cruzó por el cerebro del joven como un\r\n     relámpago. Sintió culebrear dentro de sí aquella S fugaz,\r\n[25] que se repitió una y otra vez, aumentando de intensidad.\r\n     Miró a todos lados, miró hacia la parte alta de la casa, y en\r\n     una ventana creyó distinguir un objeto semejante a un ave\r\n     blanca que movía las alas. Por la mente excitada de Pepe\r\n     Rey cruzó en un instante la idea del fénix, de la paloma, de\r\n[30] la garza real... y sin embargo, aquella ave no era más\r\n     que un pañuelo.\r\n\r\n     El ingeniero saltó por la ventana a la huerta. Observando\r\n     bien, vió la mano y el rostro de su prima. Le pareció\r\n     distinguir el tan usual movimiento de imponer silencio\r\n     llevando el dedo a los labios. Después la simpática sombra     113\r\n     alargó el brazo hacia abajo y desapareció. Pepe Rey entró\r\n     de nuevo en su cuarto rápidamente y procurando no hacer\r\n     ruido, pasó a la galería, avanzando después lentamente por\r\n[5]  ella. Sentía el palpitar de su corazón, como si recibiera\r\n     hachazos dentro del pecho. Esperó un rato... al fin\r\n     oyó distintamente tenues golpes en los peldaños de la\r\n     escalera. Uno, dos, tres.... Producían aquel rumor unos\r\n     zapatitos.\r\n\r\n[10] Dirigióse hacia allá en medio de una obscuridad casi\r\n     profunda, y alargó los brazos para prestar apoyo a quien\r\n     bajaba. En su alma reinaba una ternura exaltada y profunda;\r\n     pero ¿a qué negarlo? tras aquel dulce sentimiento\r\n     surgió de repente, como infernal inspiración, otro que era\r\n[15] un terrible deseo de venganza. Los pasos se acercaban\r\n     descendiendo. Pepe Rey avanzó, y unas manos que\r\n     tanteaban en el vacío chocaron con las suyas. Las cuatro\r\n     ¡ay! se unieron en estrecho apretón.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XVII\r\n\r\n                             =Luz a obscuras=\r\n\r\n     La galería era larga y ancha. A un extremo estaba la\r\n[20] puerta del cuarto donde moraba el ingeniero; en el centro\r\n     la del comedor, y al otro extremo la escalera y una puerta\r\n     grande y cerrada, con un peldaño en el umbral. Aquella\r\n     puerta era la de una capilla, donde los Polentinos tenían los\r\n     santos de su devoción doméstica. Alguna vez se celebraba\r\n[25] en ella el santo sacrificio de la misa.\r\n\r\n     Rosario dirigió a su primo hacia la puerta de la capilla,\r\n     y se dejó caer en el escalón.\r\n\r\n     --¿Aquí?...--murmuró Pepe Rey.\r\n\r\n     Por los movimientos de la mano derecha de Rosario,\r\n[30] comprendió que ésta se santiguaba.\r\n\r\n     --Prima querida, Rosario... ¡gracias por haberte               114\r\n     dejado ver!--exclamó estrechándola con ardor entre sus\r\n     brazos.\r\n\r\n     Sintió los dedos fríos de la joven sobre sus labios,\r\n[5]  imponiéndole silencio. Los besó con frenesí.\r\n\r\n     --Estás helada... Rosario... ¿por qué tiemblas así?\r\n\r\n     Daba diente con diente, y su cuerpo todo se estremecía\r\n     con febril convulsión. Rey sintió en su cara el abrasador\r\n     fuego del rostro de su prima, y alarmado exclamó:\r\n\r\n[10] --Tu frente es un volcán. Tienes fiebre.\r\n\r\n     --Mucha.\r\n\r\n     --¿Estás enferma realmente?\r\n\r\n     --Sí....\r\n\r\n     --Y has salido....\r\n\r\n[15] --Por verte.\r\n\r\n     El ingeniero la estrechó entre sus brazos para darle\r\n     abrigo; pero no bastaba.\r\n\r\n     --Aguarda--dijo vivamente levantándose.--Voy a mi\r\n     cuarto a traer mi manta de viaje.\r\n\r\n[20] --Apaga la luz, Pepe.\r\n\r\n     Rey había dejado encendida la luz dentro de su cuarto,\r\n     y por la puerta de éste salía una tenue claridad, iluminando\r\n     la galería. Volvió al instante. La obscuridad era ya\r\n     profunda. Tentando las paredes pudo llegar hasta donde\r\n[25] estaba su prima. Reuniéronse y la arropó cuidadosamente\r\n     de los pies a la cabeza.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué bien estás ahora, niña mía?\r\n\r\n     --Sí, ¡qué bien!... Contigo.\r\n\r\n     --Conmigo... y para siempre--exclamó con\r\n[30] exaltación el joven.\r\n\r\n     Pero observó que se desasía de sus brazos y se levantaba.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué haces?\r\n\r\n     Sintió el ruido de un hierrecillo. Rosario entraba una\r\n     llave en la invisible cerradura, y abría cuidadosamente la\r\n     puerta en cuyo umbral se habían sentado. Leve olor de          115\r\n     humedad, inherente a toda pieza cerrada por mucho tiempo,\r\n     salía de aquel recinto obscuro como una tumba. Pepe Rey\r\n     se sintió llevado de la mano, y la voz de su prima dijo muy\r\n[5]  débilmente:\r\n\r\n     --Entra.\r\n\r\n     Dieron algunos pasos. Creíase él conducido a ignotos\r\n     lugares Elíseos por el ángel de la noche. Ella tanteaba.\r\n     Por fin volvió a sonar su dulce voz, murmurando:\r\n\r\n[10] --Siéntate.\r\n\r\n     Estaban junto a un banco de madera. Los dos se sentaron.\r\n     Pepe Rey la abrazó de nuevo. En el mismo\r\n     instante su cabeza chocó con un cuerpo muy duro.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué es esto?\r\n\r\n[15] --Los pies.\r\n\r\n     --Rosario... ¿qué dices?\r\n\r\n     --Los pies del divino Jesús, de la imagen de Cristo\r\n     Crucificado, que adoramos en mi casa.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey sintió como una fría lanzada que le traspasó el\r\n[20] corazón.\r\n\r\n     --Bésalos--dijo imperiosamente la joven.\r\n\r\n     El matemático besó los helados pies de la santa imagen.\r\n\r\n     --Pepe--exclamó después la señorita, estrechando\r\n     ardientemente la mano de su primo.--¿Tú crees en Dios?\r\n\r\n[25] --¡Rosario!... ¿qué dices ahí? ¡Qué locuras\r\n     piensas!--repuso con perplejidad el primo.\r\n\r\n     --Contéstame.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey sintió humedad en sus manos.\r\n\r\n     --¿Porqué lloras?--dijo lleno de turbación.--Rosario,\r\n[30] me estás matando con tus dudas absurdas. ¡Que si creo\r\n     en Dios! ¿Lo dudas tú?\r\n\r\n     --Yo no; pero todos dicen que eres ateo.\r\n\r\n     --Desmerecerías a mis ojos, te despojarías de tu aureola\r\n     de pureza y de prestigio, si dieras crédito a tal necedad.\r\n\r\n     --Oyéndote calificar de ateo, y sin poder convencerme          116\r\n     de lo contrario por ninguna razón, he protestado desde el\r\n     fondo de mi alma contra tal calumnia. Tú no puedes ser\r\n[5]  ateo. Dentro de mí tengo yo vivo y fuerte el sentimiento\r\n     de tu religiosidad, como el de la mía propia.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué bien has hablado! ¿Entonces, por qué me\r\n     preguntas si creo en Dios?\r\n\r\n     --Porque quería escucharlo de tu misma boca y\r\n     recrearme oyéndotelo decir. ¡Hace tanto tiempo que no oigo\r\n[10] el acento de tu voz!... ¿qué mayor gusto que oírlo de\r\n     nuevo, después de tan gran silencio, diciendo: \"creo en\r\n     Dios\"?\r\n\r\n     --Rosario, hasta los malvados creen en él. Si existen\r\n     ateos, que lo dudo, son los calumniadores, los intrigantes\r\n[15] de que está infestado el mundo.... Por mi parte, me\r\n     importan poco las intrigas y las calumnias, y si tú te\r\n     sobrepones a ellas y cierras tu corazón a los sentimientos de\r\n     discordia que una mano aleve quiere introducir en él, nada\r\n     se opondrá a nuestra felicidad.\r\n\r\n[20] --¿Pero qué nos pasa? Pepe, querido Pepe... ¿tú\r\n     crees en el Diablo?\r\n\r\n     El ingeniero calló. La obscuridad de la capilla no\r\n     permitía a Rosario ver la sonrisa con que su primo acogiera\r\n     tan extraña pregunta.\r\n\r\n[25] --Será preciso creer en él--dijo al fin.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué nos pasa? Mamá me prohibe verte; pero\r\n     fuera de lo del ateísmo no habla mal de ti. Díceme que\r\n     espere; que tú decidirás; que te vas, que vuelves....\r\n     Hablame con franqueza.... ¿Has formado mala idea de\r\n[30] mi madre?\r\n\r\n     --De ninguna manera--replicó Rey, apremiado por su\r\n     delicadeza.\r\n\r\n     --¿No crees, como yo, que me quiere mucho; que\r\n     nos quiere a los dos, que sólo desea nuestro bien, y\r\n     que al fin hemos de alcanzar de ella el consentimiento         117\r\n     que deseamos?\r\n\r\n     --Si tú lo crees así, yo también.... Tu mamá nos\r\n     adora a entrambos.... Pero, querida Rosario, es preciso\r\n[5]  confesar que el Demonio ha entrado en esta casa.\r\n\r\n     --No te burles--repuso ella con cariño....--¡Ay!\r\n     mamá es muy buena. Ni una sola vez me ha dicho que no\r\n     fueras digno de ser mi marido. No insiste más que en lo\r\n     del ateísmo. Dicen además que tengo manías, y que ahora\r\n[10] me ha entrado la de quererte con toda mi alma. En nuestra\r\n     familia es ley no contrariar de frente las manías congénitas\r\n     que tenemos, porque atacándolas se agravan más.\r\n\r\n     --Pues yo creo que a tu lado hay buenos médicos que se\r\n     han propuesto curarte, y que al fin, adorada niña mía, lo van\r\n[15] a conseguir.\r\n\r\n     --No, no, no mil veces--exclamó Rosario, apoyando su\r\n     frente en el pecho de su novio.--Quiero volverme loca\r\n     contigo. Por ti estoy padeciendo; por ti estoy enferma;\r\n     por ti desprecio la vida y me expongo a morir.... Ya lo\r\n[20] preveo, mañana estaré peor, me agravaré.... Moriré;\r\n     ¡qué me importa!\r\n\r\n     --Tú no estás enferma--repuso él con energía; tú no\r\n     tienes sino una perturbación moral, que naturalmente trae\r\n     ligeras afecciones nerviosas; tú no tienes más que la pena\r\n[25] ocasionada por esta horrible violencia que están ejerciendo\r\n     sobre ti. Tu alma sencilla y generosa no lo comprende.\r\n     Cedes; perdonas a los que te hacen daño; te afliges, atribuyendo\r\n     tu desgracia a funestas influencias sobrenaturales;\r\n     padeces en silencio; entregas tu inocente cuello al verdugo;\r\n[30] te dejas matar, y el mismo cuchillo, hundido en tu garganta,\r\n     te parece la espina de una flor que se te clavó al pasar.\r\n     Rosario, desecha esas ideas: considera nuestra verdadera\r\n     situación, que es grave: mira la causa de ella donde\r\n     verdaderamente está, y no te acobardes, no cedas a la mortificación\r\n     que se te impone, enfermando tu alma y tu cuerpo.              118\r\n     El valor de que careces te devolverá la salud, porque tú no\r\n     estás realmente enferma, querida niña mía, tú estás...\r\n     ¿quieres que lo diga? estás asustada, aterrada. Te pasa\r\n[5]  lo que los antiguos no sabían definir y llamaban maleficio.\r\n     ¡Rosario, ánimo, confía en mí! Levántate y sígueme.\r\n     No te digo más.\r\n\r\n     --¡Ay, Pepe... primo mío!... se me figura que\r\n     tienes razón--exclamó Rosarito anegada en llanto.--Tus\r\n[10] palabras resuenan en mi corazón como golpes violentos\r\n     que, estremeciéndome, me dan nueva vida. Aquí en esta\r\n     obscuridad, donde no podemos vernos las caras, una luz\r\n     inefable sale de ti y me inunda el alma. ¿Qué tienes tú,\r\n     que así me transformas? Cuando te conocí, de repente fuí\r\n[15] otra. En los días en que he dejado de verte me he visto\r\n     volver a mi antiguo estado insignificante, a mi cobardía\r\n     primera. Sin ti vivo en el Limbo, Pepe mío.... Haré lo\r\n     que me dices, me levanto y te sigo. Iremos juntos a donde\r\n     quieras. ¿Sabes que me siento bien? ¿Sabes que no\r\n[20] tengo ya fiebre, que recobro las fuerzas, que quiero correr\r\n     y gritar, que todo mi ser se renueva, y se aumenta y se\r\n     centuplica para adorarte? Pepe, tienes razón. Yo no estoy\r\n     enferma, yo no estoy sino acobardada; mejor dicho,\r\n     fascinada.\r\n\r\n[25] --Eso es, fascinada.\r\n\r\n     --Fascinada. Terribles ojos me miran y me dejan muda\r\n     y trémula. Tengo miedo; ¿pero a qué?... Tú sólo\r\n     tienes el extraño poder de devolverme la vida. Oyéndote,\r\n     resucito. Yo creo que si me muriera y fueras a pasear\r\n[30] junto a mi sepultura, desde lo hondo de la tierra sentiría\r\n     tus pasos. ¡Oh, si pudiera verte ahora!... Pero estás\r\n     aquí, a mi lado, y no puedo dudar que eres tú.... ¡Tanto\r\n     tiempo sin verte!... Yo estaba loca. Cada día de soledad\r\n     me parecía un siglo.... Me decían que mañana, que\r\n     mañana, y vuelta con mañana. Yo me asomaba por las             119\r\n     noches a la ventana, y la claridad de la luz de tu cuarto me\r\n     servía de consuelo. A veces tu sombra en los cristales era\r\n     para mí una aparición divina. Yo extendía los brazos hacia\r\n[5]  fuera, derramaba lágrimas y gritaba con el pensamiento, sin\r\n     atreverme a hacerlo con la voz. Cuando recibí tu recado\r\n     por conducto de la criada; cuando recibí tu carta\r\n     diciéndome que te marchabas, me puse muy triste, creí que se me\r\n     iba saliendo el alma del cuerpo y que me moría por grados.\r\n[10] Yo caía, caía como el pájaro herido cuando vuela, que va\r\n     cayendo y muriéndose, todo al mismo tiempo.... Esta\r\n     noche, cuando te vi despierto tan tarde, no pude resistir el\r\n     anhelo de hablarte, y bajé. Creo que todo el atrevimiento\r\n     que puedo tener en mi vida lo he consumido y empleado en\r\n[15] una sola acción, en ésta, y que ya no podré dejar de ser\r\n     cobarde.... Pero tú me darás aliento; tú me darás\r\n     fuerzas; tú me ayudarás, ¿no es verdad?... Pepe, primo\r\n     mío querido, dime que sí; dime que tengo fuerzas, y las\r\n     tendré; dime que no estoy enferma, y no lo estaré. Ya\r\n[20] no lo estoy. Me encuentro tan bien, que me río de mis\r\n     males ridículos.\r\n\r\n     Al decir esto, Rosarito se sintió frenéticamente enlazada\r\n     por los brazos de su primo. Oyóse un ¡ay! pero no salió\r\n     de los labios de ella, sino de los de él, porque habiendo\r\n[25] inclinado la cabeza, tropezó violentamente con los pies\r\n     del Cristo. En la obscuridad es donde se ven las\r\n     estrellas.\r\n\r\n     En el estado de su ánimo y en la natural alucinación que\r\n     producen los sitios obscuros, a Rey le parecía, no que su\r\n[30] cabeza había topado con el santo pie, sino que éste se\r\n     había movido, amonestándole de la manera más breve y\r\n     más elocuente. Entre serio y festivo alzó la cabeza, y\r\n     dijo así:\r\n\r\n     --Señor, no me pegues, que no haré nada malo.\r\n\r\n     En el mismo instante Rosario tomó la mano del joven,           120\r\n     oprimiéndola contra su corazón. Oyóse una voz pura,\r\n     grave, angelical, conmovida, que habló de este modo:\r\n\r\n     --Señor que adoro, Señor Dios del mundo y tutelar de mi\r\n[5]  casa y de mi familia; Señor a quien Pepe también adora;\r\n     Santo Cristo bendito que moriste en la Cruz por nuestros\r\n     pecados; ante Ti, ante tu cuerpo herido, ante tu frente\r\n     coronada de espinas, digo que éste es mi esposo, y que después\r\n     de Ti, es el que más ama mi corazón; digo que le declaro mi\r\n[10] esposo, y que antes moriré que pertenecer a otro. Mi corazón\r\n     y mi alma son suyos. Haz que el mundo no se oponga\r\n     a nuestra felicidad, y concédeme el favor de esta unión, que\r\n     juro sea buena ante el mundo como lo es en mi conciencia.\r\n\r\n     --Rosario, eres mía,--exclamó Pepe con exaltación.--Ni\r\n[15] tu madre ni nadie lo impedirá.\r\n\r\n     La prima inclinó su hermoso busto inerte sobre el pecho\r\n     del primo. Temblaba en los amantes brazos varoniles,\r\n     como la paloma en las garras del águila.\r\n\r\n     Por la mente del ingeniero pasó como un rayo la idea de\r\n[20] que existía el Demonio; pero entonces el Demonio era él.\r\n     Rosario hizo ligero movimiento de miedo; tuvo como el\r\n     temblor de sorpresa que anuncia el peligro.\r\n\r\n     --Júrame que no desistirás--dijo turbadamente Rey,\r\n     atajando aquel movimiento.\r\n\r\n[25]  --Te lo juro por las cenizas de mi padre, que están....\r\n\r\n     --¿Dónde?\r\n\r\n     --Bajo nuestros pies.\r\n\r\n     El matemático sintió que se levantaba bajo sus pies la\r\n     losa... pero no, no se levantaba: es que él creyó notarlo\r\n[30] así, a pesar de ser matemático.\r\n\r\n     --Te lo juro--repitió Rosario,--por las cenizas de mi\r\n     padre y por Dios que nos está mirando.... Que nuestros\r\n     cuerpos, unidos como están, reposen bajo estas losas cuando\r\n     Dios quiera llevarnos de este mundo.\r\n\r\n     --Sí--repitió Pepe Rey, con emoción profunda,                  121\r\n     sintiendo llena su alma de una turbación inexplicable.\r\n\r\n     Ambos permanecieron en silencio durante breve rato.\r\n     Rosario se había levantado.\r\n\r\n[5]  --¿Ya?\r\n\r\n     Volvió a sentarse.\r\n\r\n     --Tiemblas otra vez--dijo Pepe.--Rosario, tú estas\r\n     mala; tu frente abrasa.\r\n\r\n     --Parece que me muero--murmuró la joven con\r\n[10] desaliento.--No sé qué tengo.\r\n\r\n     Cayó sin sentido en brazos de su primo.\r\n     Agasajándola, notó que el rostro de la joven se cubría de helado\r\n     sudor.\r\n\r\n     --Está realmente enferma--dijo para sí.--Esta salida\r\n[15] es una verdadera calaverada.\r\n\r\n     Levantóla en sus brazos, tratando de reanimarla, pero ni\r\n     el temblor de ella ni el desmayo cesaban, por lo cual\r\n     resolvió sacarla de la capilla, a fin de que el aire fresco la\r\n     reanimase. Así fué en efecto. Recobrado el sentido, manifestó\r\n[20] Rosario mucha inquietud por hallarse a tal hora fuera de su\r\n     habitación. El reloj de la catedral dió las cuatro.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué tarde!--exclamó la joven.--Suéltame, primo.\r\n     Me parece que puedo andar. Verdaderamente estoy muy\r\n     mala.\r\n\r\n[25] --Subiré contigo.\r\n\r\n     --Eso de ninguna manera. Antes iré arrastrándome\r\n     hasta mi cuarto.... ¿No te parece que se oye un ruido?...\r\n\r\n     Ambos callaron. La ansiedad de su atención determinó\r\n     un silencio absoluto.\r\n\r\n[30] --¿No oyes nada, Pepe?\r\n\r\n     --Absolutamente nada.\r\n\r\n     --Pon atención.... Ahora, ahora vuelve a sonar. Es\r\n     un rumor que no sé si suena lejos, muy lejos, o cerca, muy\r\n     cerca. Lo mismo podría ser la respiración de mi madre\r\n     que el chirrido de la veleta que está en la torre de la        122\r\n     catedral. ¡Ah! Tengo un oído muy fino.\r\n\r\n     --Demasiado fino.... Con que, querida prima, te\r\n     subiré en brazos.\r\n\r\n[5]  --Bueno, súbeme hasta lo alto de la escalera. Después\r\n     iré yo sola. En, cuanto descanse un poco, me quedaré\r\n     como si tal cosa.... ¿Pero no oyes?\r\n\r\n     Detuviéronse en el primer peldaño.\r\n\r\n     --Es un sonido metálico.\r\n\r\n[10] --¿La respiración de tu mamá?\r\n\r\n     --No, no es eso. El rumor viene de muy lejos. ¿Será\r\n     el canto de un gallo?\r\n\r\n     --Podrá ser.\r\n\r\n     --Parece que suenan dos palabras, diciendo: _allá voy_,\r\n[15] _allá voy_.\r\n\r\n     --Ya, ya oigo--murmuró Pepe Rey.\r\n\r\n     --Es un grito.\r\n\r\n     --Es una corneta.\r\n\r\n     --¡Una corneta!\r\n\r\n[20] --Sí. Sube pronto. Orbajosa va a despertar.... Ya\r\n     se oye con claridad. No es trompeta sino clarín. La tropa\r\n     se acerca.\r\n\r\n     --¡Tropa!\r\n\r\n     --No sé por qué me figuro que esta invasión militar ha\r\n[25] de ser provechosa para mí.... Estoy alegre. Rosario,\r\n     arriba pronto.\r\n\r\n     --También yo estoy alegre. Arriba.\r\n\r\n     En un instante la subió, y los dos amantes se despidieron,\r\n     hablándose al oído tan quedamente, que apenas se oían.\r\n\r\n[30] --Me asomaré por la ventana que da a la huerta, para\r\n     decirte que he llegado a mi cuarto sin novedad. Adiós.\r\n\r\n     --Adiós, Rosario. Ten cuidado de no tropezar con los\r\n     muebles.\r\n\r\n     --Por aquí navego bien, primo. Ya nos veremos otra\r\n     vez. Asómate a la ventana de tu cuarto si quieres recibir      123\r\n     mi parte telegráfico.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey hizo lo que se le mandaba; pero aguardó largo\r\n     rato y Rosario no apareció en la ventana. El ingeniero\r\n[5]  creía sentir agitadas voces en el piso alto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVIII\r\n\r\n                                =Tropa=\r\n\r\n     Los habitantes de Orbajosa oían en la crepuscular\r\n     vaguedad de su último sueño aquel clarín sonoro, y abrían los\r\n     ojos diciendo:\r\n\r\n     --Tropa.\r\n\r\n[10] Unos hablando consigo mismos, mitad dormidos, mitad\r\n     despiertos, murmuraban:\r\n\r\n     --Por fin nos han mandado esa canalla.\r\n\r\n     Otros se levantaban a toda prisa, gruñendo así:\r\n\r\n     --Vamos a ver a esos condenados.\r\n\r\n[15] Alguno apostrofaba de este modo:\r\n\r\n     --Anticipo forzoso tenemos.... Ellos dicen quintas,\r\n     contribuciones; nosotros diremos palos y más palos.\r\n\r\n     En otra casa se oyeron estas palabras, pronunciadas con\r\n     alegría:\r\n\r\n[20] --¡Si vendrá mi hij!... ¡Si vendrá mi hermano!...\r\n\r\n     Todo era saltar del lecho, vestirse a prisa, abrir las\r\n     ventanas para ver el alborotador regimiento que entraba con\r\n     las primeras luces del día. La ciudad era tristeza, silencio,\r\n     vejez; el ejército alegría, estrépito, juventud. Entrando el\r\n[25] uno en la otra, parecía que la momia recibía por arte\r\n     maravillosa el don de la vida, y bulliciosa saltaba fuera del\r\n     húmedo sarcófago para bailar en torno de él. ¡Qué\r\n     movimiento, qué algazara, qué risas, qué jovialidad! No existe\r\n     nada tan interesante como un ejército. Es la patria en su\r\n     aspecto juvenil y vigoroso. Lo que en el concepto individual   124\r\n     tiene o puede tener esa misma patria de inepta, de\r\n     levantisca, de supersticiosa unas veces, de blasfema otras,\r\n     desaparece bajo la presión férrea de la disciplina, que de\r\n[5]  tantas figurillas insignificantes hace un conjunto prodigioso.\r\n     El soldado, o sea el corpúsculo, al desprenderse, después de\r\n     un _rompan filas_, de la masa en que ha tenido vida regular y\r\n     a veces sublime, suele conservar algunas de las cualidades\r\n     peculiares del ejército. Pero esto no es lo más común. A\r\n[10] la separación suele acompañar súbito encanallamiento, de\r\n     lo cual resulta que si un ejército es gloria y honor, una\r\n     reunión de soldados puede ser calamidad insoportable, y los\r\n     pueblos que lloran de júbilo y entusiasmo al ver entrar en\r\n     su recinto un batallón victorioso, gimen de espanto y tiemblan\r\n[15] de recelo cuando ven libres y sueltos a los señores\r\n     soldados.\r\n\r\n     Esto último sucedió en Orbajosa, porque en aquellos días\r\n     no había glorias que cantar ni motivo alguno para tejer\r\n     coronas ni trazar letreros triunfales, ni mentar siquiera\r\n[20] hazañas de nuestros bravos, por cuya razón todo fué miedo\r\n     y desconfianza en la episcopal ciudad, que si bien pobre,\r\n     no carecía de tesoros en gallinas, frutas, dinero y doncellez,\r\n     los cuales corrían gran riesgo desde que entraron los consabidos\r\n     alumnos de Marte. Además de esto, la patria de los\r\n[25] Polentinos, como ciudad muy apartada del movimiento y\r\n     bullicio que han traído el tráfico, los periódicos,\r\n     ferrocarriles y otros agentes que no hay para qué analizar ahora,\r\n     no gustaba que la molestasen en su sosegada existencia.\r\n\r\n     Siempre que se le ofrecía coyuntura propicia, mostraba\r\n[30] asimismo viva repulsión a someterse a la autoridad central\r\n     que mal o bien nos gobierna; y recordando sus fueros de\r\n     antaño y mascullándolos de nuevo, como rumia el camello\r\n     la yerba que ha comido el día antes, solía hacer alarde de\r\n     cierta independencia levantisca, deplorables resabios de\r\n     behetría que a veces dieron no pocos quebraderos de cabeza     125\r\n     al gobernador de la provincia.\r\n\r\n     Otrosí debe tenerse en cuenta que Orbajosa tenía antecedentes,\r\n     o mejor dicho abolengo faccioso. Sin duda conservaba\r\n[5]  en su seno algunas fibras enérgicas de aquellas que]\r\n     en edad remota, según la entusiasta opinión de don Cayetano,\r\n     la impulsaron a inauditas acciones épicas; y aunque\r\n     en decadencia, sentía de vez en cuando violento afán de\r\n     hacer grandes cosas, aunque fueran barbaridades y desatinos.\r\n[10] Como dió al mundo tantos egregios hijos, quería\r\n     sin duda que sus actuales vástagos, los Caballucos, Merengues\r\n     y Pelosmalos renovasen las _Gestas_ gloriosas de los de\r\n     antaño.\r\n\r\n     Siempre que hubo facciones en España, aquel pueblo dió\r\n[15] a entender que no existía en vano sobre la faz de la tierra,\r\n     si bien nunca sirvió de teatro a una verdadera guerra. Su\r\n     genio, su situación, su historia la reducían al papel secundario\r\n     de levantar partidas. Obsequió al país con esta fruta\r\n     nacional en 1827 cuando los Apostólicos, durante la guerra\r\n[20] de los siete años, en 1848, y en otras épocas de menos eco\r\n     en la historia patria. Las partidas y los partidarios fueron\r\n     siempre populares, circunstancia funesta que procedía de la\r\n     guerra de la Independencia, una de esas cosas buenas que\r\n     han sido origen de infinitas cosas detestables. _Corruptio\r\n[25] optimi pessima_. Y con la popularidad de las partidas y de\r\n     los partidarios, coincidía, siempre creciente, la impopularidad\r\n     de todo lo que entraba en Orbajosa con visos de delegación\r\n     o instrumento del poder central. Los soldados fueron\r\n     siempre tan mal vistos allí, que siempre que los ancianos\r\n[30] narraban un crimen, robo, asesinato, violación, o cualquiera\r\n     otro espantable desafuero, añadían: _esto sucedió cuando vino\r\n     la tropa_.\r\n\r\n     Y ya que se ha dicho esto tan importante, bueno será\r\n     añadir que los batallones enviados allá en los mismos días\r\n     de la historia que referimos, no iban a pasearse por las       126\r\n     calles, pues que llevaban un objeto que clara y detalladamente\r\n     se verá más adelante. Como dato de no escaso\r\n     interés, apuntaremos que lo que aquí se va contando ocurrió\r\n[5]  en un año que no está muy cerca del presente, ni tampoco\r\n     muy lejos, así como también se puede decir que Orbajosa\r\n     (entre los romanos _urbs augusta_, si bien algunos eruditos\r\n     modernos examinando el _ajosa_, opinan que este rabillo lo\r\n     tiene por ser patria de los mejores ajos del mundo), no está\r\n[10] muy lejos ni tampoco muy cerca de Madrid, no debiendo\r\n     tampoco asegurarse que enclave sus gloriosos cimientos al\r\n     Norte ni al Sur, ni al Este ni al Oeste, sino que es posible\r\n     esté en todas partes, y por do quiera que los españoles\r\n     revuelvan sus ojos y sientan el picar de sus ajos.\r\n\r\n[15] Repartidas por el municipio las cédulas de alojamiento,\r\n     cada cual se fué en busca de su hogar prestado. Les recibían\r\n     de muy mal talante, dándoles acomodo en los lugares\r\n     más atrozmente inhabitables de las casas. Las muchachas\r\n     del pueblo no eran en verdad las más descontentas; pero\r\n[20] se ejercía sobre ellas una gran vigilancia, y no era decente\r\n     mostrar alegría por la visita de tal canalla. Los pocos soldados\r\n     hijos de la comarca eran los únicos que estaban a\r\n     cuerpo de rey. Los demás eran considerados como extranjeros.\r\n\r\n[25] A las ocho de la mañana un teniente coronel de caballería\r\n     entró con su cédula en casa de doña Perfecta Polentinos.\r\n     Recibiéronle los criados, por encargo de su señora,\r\n     que hallándose en deplorable situación de ánimo, no quiso\r\n     bajar al encuentro del soldadote, y señaláronle para vivienda\r\n[30] la única habitación al parecer disponible de la casa, el\r\n     cuarto que ocupaba Pepe Rey.\r\n\r\n     --Que se acomoden como puedan--dijo doña Perfecta\r\n     con expresión de hiel y vinagre.--Y si no caben que se\r\n     vayan a la calle.\r\n\r\n     ¿Era su intención molestar de este modo al infame              127\r\n     sobrino, o realmente no había en el edificio otra pieza disponible?\r\n     No lo sabemos, ni las crónicas de donde esta\r\n     verídica historia ha salido dicen una palabra acerca de tan\r\n[5]  importante cuestión. Lo que sabemos de un modo incontrovertible\r\n     es que lejos de mortificar a los dos huéspedes\r\n     que les embaularan juntos, causóles sumo gusto por ser\r\n     amigos antiguos. Grande y alegre sorpresa tuvieron uno y\r\n[10] y lanzar exclamaciones, ponderando la extraña casualidad que\r\n     los unía en tal sitio y ocasión.\r\n\r\n     --Pinzón... ¡tú por aquí!... ¿Pero qué es esto?\r\n     No sospechaba que estuvieras tan cerca...\r\n\r\n     --Yo oí decir que andabas por estas tierras, Pepe Rey;\r\n[15] pero tampoco creí encontrarte en la horrible, en la salvaje\r\n     Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     --¡Pero qué casualidad feliz!... porque esta casualidad\r\n     es felicísima, providencial... Pinzón, entre tú y yo\r\n     vamos a hacer algo grande en este poblacho.\r\n\r\n[20] --Y tendremos tiempo de meditarlo--repuso el otro\r\n     sentándose en el lecho donde el ingeniero estaba acostado,--porque\r\n     según parece viviremos los dos en esta pieza.\r\n     ¿Qué demonios de casa es ésta?\r\n\r\n     --Hombre, la de mi tía. Habla con más respeto. ¿No\r\n[25] conoces a mi tía?... Pero voy a levantarme.\r\n\r\n     --Me alegro, porque con eso me acostaré yo, que bastante\r\n     lo necesito... ¡Qué camino, amigo Pepe, qué\r\n     camino y qué pueblo!\r\n\r\n     --Dime, ¿venís a pegar fuego a Orbajosa?\r\n\r\n[30] --¡Fuego!\r\n\r\n     --Dígolo porque yo tal vez os ayudaría.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué pueblo! ¡pero qué pueblo!--exclamó el militar\r\n     tirando el chacó, poniendo a un lado espada y tahalí,\r\n     cartera de viaje y capote.--Es la segunda vez que nos\r\n     mandan aquí. Te juro que a la tercera pido la licencia         128\r\n     absoluta.\r\n\r\n     --No hables mal de esta buena gente. ¡Pero qué a\r\n     tiempo has venido! Parece que te manda Dios en mi\r\n[5]  ayuda, Pinzón... Tengo un proyecto terrible, una aventura,\r\n     si quieres llamarla así, un plan, amigo mío... y me\r\n     hubiera sido muy difícil salir adelante sin ti. Hace un\r\n     momento me volvía loco cavilando y dije lleno de ansiedad:\r\n     \"Si yo tuviera aquí un amigo, un buen amigo\"...\r\n[10] --Proyecto, plan, aventura... Una de dos, señor\r\n     matemático, o es dar la dirección a los globos o algo de\r\n     amores...\r\n\r\n     --Es formal, muy formal. Acuéstate, duerme un poco\r\n     y después hablaremos.\r\n\r\n[15] --Me acostaré, pero no dormiré. Puedes contarme todo\r\n     lo que quieras. Sólo te pido que hables lo menos posible\r\n     de Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     --Precisamente de Orbajosa te quiero hablar. ¿Pero tú\r\n     también tienes antipatía a esa cuna de tantos varones\r\n[20] insignes?\r\n\r\n     --Estos ajeros... Los llamamos los ajeros... pues\r\n     digo que serán todo lo insignes que tú quieras; pero a mí\r\n     me pican como los frutos del país. Este es un pueblo\r\n     dominado por gentes que enseñan la desconfianza, la superstición\r\n[25] y el aborrecimiento a todo el género humano.\r\n     Cuando estemos despacio te contaré un sucedido... un\r\n     lance, mitad gracioso, mitad terrible que me pasó aquí el\r\n     año pasado... Cuando te lo cuente tú te reirás y yo\r\n     echaré chispas de cólera... Pero en fin, lo pasado,\r\n[30] pasado.\r\n\r\n     --Lo que a mí me pasa no tiene nada de gracioso.\r\n\r\n     --Pero los motivos de mi aborrecimiento a este poblachón\r\n     son diversos. Has de saber que aquí asesinaron a mi\r\n     padre el 48 unos desalmados partidarios. Era brigadier y\r\n     estaba fuera de servicio. Llamóle el Gobierno, y pasaba        129\r\n     por Villahorrenda para ir a Madrid, cuando fué cogido por\r\n     media docena de tunantes... Aquí hay varias dinastías\r\n     de guerrilleros. Los Aceros, los Caballucos, los Pelosmalos... un\r\n[5]  periódico suelto, como dijo quien sabía muy bien\r\n     lo que decía.\r\n\r\n     --Supongo que la venida de dos regimientos con alguna\r\n     caballería no será por gusto de visitar estos amenos vergeles.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué ha de ser? Venimos a recorrer el país. Hay\r\n[10] muchos depósitos de armas. El Gobierno no se atreve a\r\n     destituir a la mayor parte de los Ayuntamientos sin desparramar\r\n     algunas compañías por estos pueblos. Como hay\r\n     tanta agitación facciosa por esta tierra; como dos provincias\r\n     cercanas están ya infestadas, y como además este distrito\r\n[15] municipal de Orbajosa tiene una historia tan brillante\r\n     en todas las guerras civiles, hay temores de que los bravos\r\n     de por aquí se echen a los caminos a saquear lo que\r\n     encuentren.\r\n\r\n     --¡Buena precaución! Pero creo que mientras esta\r\n[20] gente no perezca y vuelva a nacer; mientras hasta las\r\n     piedras no muden de forma, no habrá paz en Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     --Ésa es también mi opinión--dijo el militar encendiendo\r\n     un cigarrillo.--¿No ves que los partidarios son la\r\n     gente mimada en este país? A todos los que asolaron la\r\n[25] comarca en 1848 y en otras épocas, o a falta de ellos a sus\r\n     hijos, les encuentras colocados en los fielatos, en puertas,\r\n     en el Ayuntamiento, en la conducción del correo: los hay\r\n     que son alguaciles, sacristanes, comisionados de apremios.\r\n     Algunos se han hecho temibles caciques, y son los que\r\n[30] amasan las elecciones y tienen influjo en Madrid, reparten\r\n     destinos... en fin, esto da grima.\r\n\r\n     --Dime, ¿y no se podrá esperar que los partidarios hagan\r\n     una fechoría en estos días? Si así fuera, ustedes arrasarían\r\n     el pueblo, y yo les ayudaría.\r\n\r\n     --Si en mí consistiera... Ellos harán de las suyas--dijo       130\r\n     Pinzón,--porque las facciones de las dos provincias\r\n     cercanas crecen como una maldición de Dios. Y acá para\r\n     entre los dos, amigo Rey, yo creo que esto va largo. Algunos\r\n[5]  se ríen y aseguran que no puede haber otra guerra civil]\r\n     como la pasada. No conocen el país, no conocen a Orbajosa\r\n     y sus habitantes. Yo sostengo que esto que ahora\r\n     empieza lleva larga cola, y que tendremos una nueva lucha\r\n     cruel y sangrienta que durará lo que Dios quiera. ¿Qué\r\n[10] opinas tú?\r\n\r\n     --Amigo, en Madrid me reía yo de todos los que hablaban\r\n     de la posibilidad de una guerra civil tan larga y terrible\r\n     como la de siete años; pero ahora, después que estoy\r\n     aquí...\r\n\r\n[15] --Es preciso engolfarse en estos países encantadores:\r\n     ver de cerca esta gente y oírle dos palabras para saber de\r\n     qué pie cojea.\r\n\r\n     --Pues sí... sin poderme explicar en qué fundo mis\r\n     ideas, ello es que desde aquí veo las cosas de otra manera,\r\n[20] y pienso en la posibilidad de largas y feroces guerras.\r\n\r\n     --Exactamente.\r\n\r\n     --Pero ahora, más que la guerra pública, me preocupa\r\n     una privada en que estoy metido y que he declarado hace\r\n     poco.\r\n\r\n[25] --¿Dijiste que ésta es la casa de tu tía? ¿Cómo se\r\n     llama?\r\n\r\n     --Doña Perfecta Rey de Polentinos.\r\n\r\n     --¡Ah! La conozco de nombre. Es una persona excelente,\r\n     y la única de quien no he oído hablar mal a los\r\n[30] ajeros. Cuando estuve aquí la otra vez, en todas partes\r\n     oía ponderar su bondad, su caridad, sus virtudes.\r\n\r\n     --Sí, mi tía es muy bondadosa, muy amable--dijo\r\n     Rey.\r\n\r\n     Después quedó pensativo breve rato.\r\n\r\n     --Pero ahora recuerdo...--exclamó de súbito Pinzón.--Cómo      131\r\n     se van atando cabos... Sí, en Madrid me dijeron\r\n     que te casabas con una prima. Todo está descubierto.\r\n     ¿Es aquella linda y celestial Rosarito?...\r\n\r\n[5]  --Pinzón, vamos a hablar detenidamente.\r\n\r\n     --Se me figura que hay contrariedades.\r\n\r\n     --Hay algo más. Hay luchas terribles. Se necesitan\r\n     amigos poderosos, listos, de iniciativa, de gran experiencia\r\n     en los lances difíciles, de gran astucia y valor.\r\n\r\n[10] --Hombre, eso es todavía más grave que un desafío.\r\n\r\n     --Mucho más grave. Se bate uno fácilmente con otro\r\n     hombre. Con mujeres, con invisibles enemigos que trabajan\r\n     en la sombra, es imposible.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos: ya soy todo oídos.\r\n\r\n[15] El teniente coronel Pinzón descansaba cuan largo era\r\n     sobre el lecho. Pepe Rey acercó una silla y apoyando en\r\n     el mismo lecho el codo y en la mano la cabeza, empezó su\r\n     conferencia, consulta, exposición de plan o lo que fuera, y\r\n     habló larguísimo rato. Oíale Pinzón con curiosidad profunda\r\n[20] y sin decir nada, salvo algunas preguntillas sueltas\r\n     para pedir nuevos datos o la aclaración de alguna obscuridad.\r\n     Cuando Rey concluyó, Pinzón estaba serio. Estiróse\r\n     en la cama, desperezándose con la placentera convulsión de\r\n     quien no ha dormido en tres noches, y después dijo así:\r\n\r\n[25] --Tu plan es arriesgado y difícil.\r\n\r\n     --Pero no imposible.\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh! no, que nada hay imposible en este mundo.\r\n     Piénsalo bien.\r\n\r\n     --Ya lo he pensado.\r\n\r\n[30] --¿Y estás resuelto a llevarlo adelante? Mira que esas\r\n     cosas ya no se estilan. Suelen salir mal, y no dejan bien\r\n     parado a quien las hace.\r\n\r\n     --Estoy resuelto.\r\n\r\n     --Pues por mi parte, aunque el asunto es arriesgado y\r\n     grave, muy grave, estoy dispuesto a ayudarte en todo y por     132\r\n     todo.\r\n\r\n     --¿Cuento contigo?\r\n\r\n     --Hasta morir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XIX\r\n\r\n                    =Combate terrible.--Estrategia=\r\n\r\n[5]  Los primeros fuegos no podían tardar. A la hora de la\r\n     comida, después de ponerse de acuerdo con Pinzón respecto\r\n     al plan convenido, cuya primera condición era que ambos\r\n     amigos fingirían no conocerse, Pepe Rey fué al comedor.\r\n     Allí encontró a su tía que acababa de llegar de la catedral,\r\n[10] donde pasaba, según su costumbre, toda la mañana. Estaba\r\n     sola y parecía hondamente preocupada. El ingeniero\r\n     observó que sobre aquel semblante pálido y marmóreo, no\r\n     exento de cierta hermosura, se proyectaba la misteriosa\r\n     sombra de un celaje. Al mirar recobraba la claridad\r\n[15] siniestra; pero miraba poco, y después de una rápida\r\n     observación del rostro de su sobrino, el de la bondadosa dama se\r\n     ponía otra vez en su estudiada penumbra.\r\n\r\n     Aguardaban en silencio la comida. No esperaron a D.\r\n     Cayetano, porque éste había ido a Mundogrande. Cuando\r\n[20] empezaron a comer, doña Perfecta dijo:\r\n\r\n     --Y ese militarote que nos ha regalado hoy el Gobierno,\r\n     ¿no viene a comer?\r\n\r\n     --Parece tener más sueño que hambre--repuso el\r\n     ingeniero sin mirar a su tía.\r\n\r\n[25] --¿Le conoces tú?\r\n\r\n     --No le he visto en mi vida.\r\n\r\n     --Pues estamos divertidos con los huéspedes que nos\r\n     manda el Gobierno. Aquí tenemos nuestras camas y nuestra\r\n     comida para cuando a esos perdidos de Madrid se les\r\n[30] antoje disponer de ellas.\r\n\r\n     --Es que hay temores de que se levanten partidas--dijo         133\r\n     Pepe Rey, sintiendo que una centella corría por todos sus\r\n     miembros,--y el Gobierno está decidido a aplastar a los\r\n     orbajosenses, a aplastarlos, a hacerlos polvo.\r\n\r\n[5]  --Hombre, pára, pára por Dios, no nos pulverices--exclamó\r\n     la señora con sarcasmo.--¡Pobrecitos de nosotros!\r\n     Ten piedad, hombre, y deja vivir a estas infelices criaturas.\r\n     Y qué, ¿serás tú de los que ayuden a la tropa en la grandiosa\r\n     obra de nuestro aplastamiento?\r\n\r\n[10] --Yo no soy militar. No haré más que aplaudir cuando\r\n     vea extirpados para siempre los gérmenes de guerra civil,\r\n     de insubordinación, de discordia, de behetría, de bandolerismo\r\n     y de barbarie que existen aquí para vergüenza de\r\n     nuestra época y de nuestro país.\r\n\r\n[15] --Todo sea por Dios.\r\n\r\n     --Orbajosa, querida tía, casi no tiene más que ajos y\r\n     bandidos, porque bandidos son los que en nombre de una\r\n     idea política o religiosa, se lanzan a correr aventuras cada\r\n     cuatro o cinco años.\r\n\r\n[20] --Gracias, gracias, querido sobrino--dijo doña Perfecta,\r\n     palideciendo.--¿Con que Orbajosa no tiene más que eso?\r\n     Algo más habrá aquí, algo más que tú no tienes y que has\r\n     venido a buscar entre nosotros.\r\n\r\n     Rey sintió el bofetón. Su alma se quemaba. Érale muy\r\n[25] difícil guardar a su tía las consideraciones que por sexo,\r\n     estado y posición merecía. Hallábase en el disparadero de\r\n     la violencia, y un ímpetu irresistible le empujaba, lanzándole\r\n     contra su interlocutora.\r\n\r\n     --Yo he venido a Orbajosa--dijo,--porque usted me\r\n[30] mandó llamar; usted concertó con mi padre....\r\n\r\n     --Sí, sí es verdad--repuso la señora, interrumpiéndole\r\n     vivamente y procurando recobrar su habitual dulzura.--No\r\n     lo niego. Aquí el verdadero culpable he sido yo. Yo tengo\r\n     la culpa de tu aburrimiento, de los desaires que nos haces,\r\n     de todo lo desagradable que en mi casa ocurre con motivo       134\r\n     de tu venida.\r\n\r\n     --Me alegro de que usted lo conozca.\r\n\r\n     --En cambio, tú eres un santo. ¿Será preciso también\r\n[5]  que me ponga de rodillas ante tu graciosidad y te pida\r\n     perdón?...\r\n\r\n     --Señora--dijo Pepe Rey gravemente, dejando de comer,--ruego\r\n     a usted que no se burle de mí de una manera tan\r\n     despiadada. Yo no puedo ponerme en ese terreno.... No\r\n[10] he dicho más sino que vine a Orbajosa llamado por usted.\r\n\r\n     --Y es cierto. Tu padre y yo concertamos que te casaras\r\n     con Rosario. Viniste a conocerla. Yo te acepté desde\r\n     luego como hijo.... Tú aparentaste amar a Rosario....\r\n\r\n     --Perdóneme usted--objetó Pepe.--Yo amaba y amo\r\n[15] a Rosario; usted aparentó aceptarme por hijo; usted,\r\n     recibiéndome con engañosa cordialidad, empleó desde el\r\n     primer momento todas las artes de la astucia para\r\n     contrariarme y estorbar el cumplimiento de las proposiciones\r\n     hechas a mi padre; usted se propuso desde el primer día\r\n[20] desesperarme, aburrirme, y con los labios llenos de sonrisas\r\n     y de palabras cariñosas, me ha estado matando,\r\n     achicharrándome a fuego lento; usted ha lanzado contra mí en la\r\n     obscuridad y a mansalva un enjambre de pleitos; usted me\r\n     ha destituído del cargo oficial que traje a Orbajosa; usted\r\n[25] me ha desprestigiado en la ciudad; usted me ha expulsado\r\n     de la catedral; usted me ha tenido en constante ausencia\r\n     de la escogida de mi corazón; usted ha mortificado a su\r\n     hija con un encierro inquisitorial que le hará perder la vida,\r\n     si Dios no pone su mano en ello.\r\n\r\n[30] Doña Perfecta se puso como la grana. Pero aquella\r\n     viva llamarada de su orgullo ofendido y de su pensamiento\r\n     descubierto pasó rápidamente dejándola pálida y verdosa.\r\n     Sus labios temblaban. Arrojando el cubierto con que\r\n     comía, se levantó de súbito. El sobrino se levantó también.    135\r\n\r\n     --¡Dios mío, Santa Virgen del Socorro!--exclamó la\r\n     señora, llevándose ambas manos a la cabeza y\r\n     comprimiéndosela según el ademán propio de la desesperación.--¿Es\r\n     posible que yo merezca tan atroces insultos? Pepe, hijo\r\n[5]  mío, ¿eres tú el que habla?... Si he hecho lo que dices,\r\n     en verdad que soy muy pecadora.\r\n\r\n     Dejóse caer en el sofá y se cubrió el rostro con las manos.\r\n     Pepe, acercándose lentamente a ella, observó el angustioso\r\n     sollozar de su tía y las lágrimas que abundantemente\r\n[10] derramaba. A pesar de su convicción no pudo vencer el ligero\r\n     enternecimiento que se apoderó de él, y sintiéndose cobarde,\r\n     experimentó cierta pena por lo mucho y fuerte que había dicho.\r\n\r\n     --Querida tía--indicó, poniéndole la mano en el hombro.--Si\r\n     me contesta usted con lágrimas y suspiros, me\r\n[15] conmoverá, pero no me convencerá. Razones y no sentimientos\r\n     me hacen falta. Hábleme usted, dígame que me equivoco\r\n     al pensar lo que pienso, pruébemelo después, y reconoceré\r\n     mi error.\r\n\r\n     --Déjame. Tú no eres hijo de mi hermano. Si lo\r\n[20] fueras no me insultarías como me has insultado. ¿Con que\r\n     yo soy una intrigante, una comedianta, una harpía hipócrita,\r\n     una diplomática de enredos caseros?...\r\n\r\n     Al decir esto, la señora había descubierto su rostro y\r\n     contemplaba a su sobrino con expresión beatífica. Pepe\r\n[25] estaba perplejo. Las lágrimas, así como la dulce voz de la\r\n     hermana de su padre, no podían ser fenómenos\r\n     insignificantes para el alma del matemático. Las palabras le\r\n     retozaban en la boca para pedir perdón. Hombre de gran\r\n     energía por lo común, cualquier accidente de sensibilidad,\r\n[30] cualquier agente que obrase sobre su corazón, le trocaba de\r\n     súbito en niño. Achaques de matemático. Dicen que\r\n     Newton era también así.\r\n\r\n     --Yo quiero darte las razones que pides--dijo doña\r\n     Perfecta, indicándole que se sentase junto a ella.--Yo\r\n     quiero desagraviarte. Para que veas si soy buena, si soy       136\r\n     indulgente, si soy humilde.... ¿Crees que te contradiré,\r\n     que negaré en absoluto los hechos de que me has acusado?...\r\n     Pues no, no los niego.\r\n\r\n[5]  El ingeniero se quedó asombrado.\r\n\r\n     --No los niego--prosiguió la señora.--Lo que niego\r\n     es la dañada intención que les atribuyes. ¿Con qué derecho\r\n     te metes a juzgar lo que no conoces sino por indicios y\r\n     conjeturas? ¿Tienes tú la suprema inteligencia que se\r\n[10] necesita para juzgar de plano las acciones de los demás\r\n     y dar sentencia sobre ellas? ¿Eres Dios para conocer las\r\n     intenciones?\r\n\r\n     Pepe se asombró más.\r\n\r\n     --¿No es lícito emplear alguna vez en la vida medios\r\n[15] indirectos para conseguir un fin bueno y honrado? ¿Con\r\n     qué derecho juzgas acciones mías que no comprendes bien?\r\n     Yo, querido sobrino, ostentando una sinceridad que tú no\r\n     mereces, te confieso que sí, que efectivamente me he valido\r\n     de subterfugios para conseguir un fin bueno, para conseguir\r\n[20] lo que al mismo tiempo era beneficioso para ti y para mi\r\n     hija.... ¿No comprendes? Parece que estás lelo....\r\n     ¡Ah! Tu gran entendimiento de matemático y de filósofo\r\n     alemán no es capaz de penetrar estas sutilezas de una madre\r\n     prudente.\r\n\r\n[25] --Es que me asombro más y más cada vez--dijo el\r\n     ingeniero.\r\n\r\n     --Asómbrate todo lo que quieras, pero confiesa tu\r\n     barbaridad--manifestó la dama, aumentando en bríos;--reconoce\r\n     tu ligereza y brutal comportamiento conmigo, al\r\n[30] acusarme como lo has hecho. Eres un mozalvete sin\r\n     experiencia ni otro saber que el de los libros, que nada enseñan\r\n     del mundo ni del corazón. Tú de nada entiendes más que\r\n     de hacer caminos y muelles. ¡Ay! señorito mío. En el\r\n     corazón humano no se entra por los túneles de los ferrocarriles,\r\n     ni se baja a sus hondos abismos por los pozos de las           137\r\n     minas. No se lee en la conciencia ajena con los microscopios\r\n     de los naturalistas, ni se decide la culpabilidad del prójimo\r\n     nivelando las ideas con teodolito.\r\n\r\n[5]  --¡Por Dios, querida tía!...\r\n\r\n     --¿Para qué nombras a Dios si no crees en él?--dijo\r\n     doña Perfecta con solemne acento.--Si creyeras en él, si\r\n     fueras buen cristiano, no aventurarías pérfidos juicios sobre\r\n     mi conducta. Yo soy una mujer piadosa, ¿entiendes? Yo\r\n[10] tengo mi conciencia tranquila, ¿entiendes? Yo sé lo que\r\n     hago y por qué lo hago, ¿entiendes?\r\n\r\n     --Entiendo, entiendo, entiendo.\r\n\r\n     --Dios, en quien tú no crees, ve lo que tú no ves ni\r\n     puedes ver, el intento. Y no te digo más; no quiero entrar en\r\n[15] explicaciones largas porque no lo necesito. Tampoco me\r\n     entenderías si te dijera que deseaba alcanzar mi objeto sin\r\n     escándalo, sin ofender a tu padre, sin ofenderte a ti, sin dar\r\n     que hablar a las gentes con una negativa explícita....\r\n     Nada de esto te diré, porque tampoco lo entenderás, Pepe.\r\n[20] Eres matemático. Ves lo que tienes delante y nada más;\r\n     la naturaleza brutal y nada más; rayas, ángulos, pesos y\r\n     nada más. Ves el efecto y no la causa. El que no cree en\r\n     Dios no ve causas. Dios es la suprema intención del\r\n     mundo. El que le desconoce, necesariamente ha de juzgar\r\n[25] de todo como juzgas tú, a lo tonto. Por ejemplo, en la\r\n     tempestad no ve más que destrucción, en el incendio\r\n     estragos, en la sequía miseria, en los terremotos desolación, y\r\n     sin embargo, orgulloso señorito, en todas esas aparentes\r\n     calamidades, hay que buscar la bondad de la intención...\r\n[30] sí señor, la intención siempre buena de quien no puede\r\n     hacer nada malo.\r\n\r\n     Esta embrollada, sutil y mística dialéctica no convenció a\r\n     Rey; pero no quiso seguir a su tía por la áspera senda de\r\n     tales argumentaciones, y sencillamente le dijo:\r\n\r\n     --Bueno; yo respeto las intenciones....                        138\r\n\r\n     --Ahora que pareces reconocer tu error--prosiguió la\r\n     piadosa señora, cada vez más valiente,--te haré otra\r\n     confesión, y es que voy comprendiendo que hice mal en\r\n[5]  adoptar tal sistema, aunque mi objeto era inmejorable. Dado\r\n     tu carácter arrebatado, dada tu incapacidad para\r\n     comprenderme, debí abordar la cuestión de frente y decirte:\r\n     \"sobrino mío, no quiero que seas esposo de mi hija.\"\r\n\r\n     --Ese es el lenguaje que debió emplear usted conmigo\r\n[10] desde el primer día--repuso el ingeniero, respirando con\r\n     desahogo, como quien se ve libre de enorme peso.--Agradezco\r\n     mucho a usted esas palabras. Después de ser acuchillado\r\n     en las tinieblas, ese bofetón a la luz del día me\r\n     complace mucho.\r\n\r\n[15] --Pues te repito el bofetón, sobrino--afirmó la señora\r\n     con tanta energía como displicencia.--Ya lo sabes. No\r\n     quiero que te cases con Rosario.\r\n\r\n     Pepe calló. Hubo una larga pausa, durante la cual los\r\n     dos estuvieron mirándose atentamente, cual si la cara de cada\r\n[20] uno fuese para el contrario la más perfecta obra del arte.\r\n\r\n     --¿No entiendes lo que te he dicho?--repitió ella.--Que\r\n     se acabó todo, que no hay boda.\r\n\r\n     --Permítame usted, querida tía--dijo el joven con\r\n     entereza,--que no me aterre con la intimación. En el estado\r\n[25] a que han llegado las cosas, la negativa de usted es de\r\n     escaso valor para mí.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué dices?--gritó fulminante doña Perfecta.\r\n\r\n     --Lo que usted oye. Me casaré con Rosario.\r\n\r\n     Doña Perfecta se levantó indignada, majestuosa, terrible.\r\n[30] Su actitud era la del anatema hecho mujer. Rey\r\n     permaneció sentado, sereno, valiente, con el valor pasivo de una\r\n     creencia profunda y de una resolución inquebrantable. El\r\n     desplome de toda la iracundia de su tía, que le amenazaba,\r\n     no le hizo pestañear. Él era así.\r\n\r\n     --Eres un loco. ¡Casarte tú con mi hija, casarte tú con        139\r\n     ella, no queriendo yo!...\r\n\r\n     Los labios trémulos de la señora articularon estas\r\n     palabras con el verdadero acento de la tragedia.\r\n\r\n[5]  --¡No queriendo usted!... Ella opina de distinto\r\n     modo.\r\n\r\n     --¡No queriendo yo!...--repitió la dama.--Sí, y lo\r\n     digo y lo repito: no quiero, no quiero.\r\n\r\n     --Ella y yo lo deseamos.\r\n\r\n[10] --Menguado, ¿acaso no hay en el mundo más que ella\r\n     y tú? ¿No hay padres, no hay sociedad, no hay conciencia,\r\n     no hay Dios?\r\n\r\n     --Porque hay sociedad, porque hay conciencia, porque\r\n     hay Dios--afirmó gravemente Rey, levantándose y alzando\r\n[15] el brazo y señalando al cielo,--digo y repito que me casaré\r\n     con ella.\r\n\r\n     --¡Miserable, orgulloso! Y si todo lo atropellaras, ¿crees\r\n     que no hay leyes para impedir tu violencia?\r\n\r\n     --Porque hay leyes digo y repito que me casaré con\r\n[20] ella.\r\n\r\n     --Nada respetas.\r\n\r\n     --Nada que sea indigno de respeto.\r\n\r\n     --Y mi autoridad, y mi voluntad, yo... ¿yo no soy\r\n     nada?\r\n\r\n[25] --Para mí su hija de usted es todo: lo demás nada.\r\n\r\n     La entereza de Pepe Rey era como los alardes de una\r\n     fuerza incontrastable, con perfecta conciencia de sí misma.\r\n     Daba golpes secos, contundentes, sin atenuación de ningún\r\n     género. Sus palabras parecían, si es permitida la comparación,\r\n[30] una artillería despiadada.\r\n\r\n     Doña Perfecta cayó de nuevo en el sofá; pero no lloraba,\r\n     y una convulsión nerviosa agitaba sus miembros.\r\n\r\n     --De modo que para este ateo infame--exclamó con\r\n     franca rabia,--no hay conveniencias sociales, no hay nada\r\n     más que un capricho. Eso es una avaricia indigna. Mi           140\r\n     hija es rica.\r\n\r\n     --Si piensa usted herirme con esa arma sutil,\r\n     tergiversando la cuestión e interpretando torcidamente mis\r\n[5]  sentimientos, para lastimar mi dignidad, se equivoca, querida tía.\r\n     Llámeme usted avaro. Dios sabe lo que soy.\r\n\r\n     --No tienes dignidad.\r\n\r\n     --Ésa es una opinión como otra cualquiera. El mundo\r\n     podrá tenerla a usted en olor de infalibilidad. Yo no. Estoy\r\n[10] muy lejos de creer que las sentencias de usted no tengan\r\n     apelación ante Dios.\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero es cierto lo que dices?... ¿Pero insistes\r\n     después de mi negativa?... Tú lo atropellas todo, eres\r\n     un monstruo, un bandido.\r\n\r\n[15] --Soy un hombre.\r\n\r\n     --¡Un miserable! Acabemos: yo te niego a mi hija,\r\n     yo te la niego.\r\n\r\n     --¡Pues yo la tomaré! No tomo más que lo que es mío.\r\n\r\n     --Quítate de mi presencia--exclamó la señora, levantándose\r\n[20] de súbito.--Fatuo, ¿crees que mi hija se acuerda de ti?\r\n\r\n     --Me ama, lo mismo que yo a ella.\r\n\r\n     --¡Mentira, mentira!\r\n\r\n     --Ella misma me lo ha dicho. Dispénseme usted si en\r\n     esta cuestión doy más fe a la opinión de ella que a la de\r\n[25] su mamá.\r\n\r\n     --¿Cuándo te lo ha dicho, si no la has visto en muchos\r\n     días?\r\n\r\n     --La he visto anoche y me ha jurado ante el Cristo de la\r\n     capilla que sería mi mujer.\r\n\r\n[30] --¡Oh escándalo y libertinaje!... ¿Pero qué es esto?\r\n     ¡Dios mío, qué deshonra!--exclamó doña Perfecta\r\n     comprimiéndose otra vez con ambas manos la cabeza y dando\r\n     algunos pasos por la habitación.--¿Rosario salió anoche\r\n     de su cuarto?\r\n\r\n     --Salió para verme. Ya era tiempo.                             141\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué vil conducta la tuya! Has procedido como los\r\n     ladrones, has procedido como los seductores adocenados.\r\n\r\n     --He procedido según la escuela de usted. Mi intención\r\n[5]  era buena.\r\n\r\n     --¡Y ella bajó!... ¡Ah! lo sospechaba. Esta mañana\r\n     al amanecer la sorprendí vestida en su cuarto. Díjome que\r\n     había salido no sé a qué.... El verdadero criminal lo\r\n     eres tú, tú.... Esto es una deshonra. Pepe, esperaba\r\n[10] todo de ti, menos tan grande ultraje.... Todo acabó.\r\n     Márchate. No existes para mí. Te perdono, con tal de\r\n     que te vayas.... No diré una palabra de esto a tu padre....\r\n     ¡Qué horrible egoísmo! No, no hay amor en ti.\r\n     ¡Tú no amas a mi hija!\r\n\r\n[15] --Dios sabe que la adoro, y me basta.\r\n\r\n     --No pongas a Dios en tus labios, blasfemo, y calla--exclamó\r\n     doña Perfecta.--En nombre de Dios, a quien\r\n     puedo invocar, porque creo en él, te digo que mi hija no\r\n     será jamás tu mujer. Mi hija se salvará, Pepe; mi hija\r\n[20] no puede ser condenada en vida al infierno, porque infierno\r\n     es la unión contigo.\r\n\r\n     --Rosario será mi esposa--repitió el matemático con\r\n     patética calma.\r\n\r\n     Irritábase más la piadosa señora con la energía serena de\r\n[25] su sobrino. Con voz entrecortada habló así:\r\n\r\n     --No creas que me amedrentan tus amenazas. Sé lo\r\n     que digo. Pues qué, ¿se puede atropellar un hogar, una\r\n     familia; se puede atropellar la autoridad humana y divina?\r\n\r\n     --Yo atropellaré todo--dijo el ingeniero, empezando a\r\n[30] perder su calma y expresándose con alguna agitación.\r\n\r\n     --¡Lo atropellarás todo! ¡Ah! Bien se ve que eres un\r\n     bárbaro, un salvaje, un hombre que vive de la violencia.\r\n\r\n     --No, querida tía. Soy manso, recto, honrado y enemigo\r\n     de violencia; pero entre usted y yo, entre usted que es la\r\n     ley y yo que soy el destinado a acatarla, está una pobre       142\r\n     criatura atormentada, un ángel de Dios sujeto a inicuos\r\n     martirios. Este espectáculo, esta injusticia, esta violencia\r\n     inaudita es la que convierte mi rectitud en barbarie, mi\r\n[5]  razón en fuerza, mi honradez en violencia parecida a la de\r\n     los asesinos y ladrones; este espectáculo, señora mía, es lo\r\n     que me impulsa a no respetar la ley de usted, lo que me\r\n     impulsa a pasar sobre ella, atropellándolo todo. Esto que\r\n     parece un desatino es una ley ineludible. Hago lo que\r\n[10] hacen las sociedades, cuando una brutalidad tan ilógica\r\n     como irritante se opone a su marcha. Pasan por encima y\r\n     todo lo destrozan con feroz acometida. Tal soy yo en este\r\n     momento: yo mismo no me conozco. Era razonable y soy\r\n     un bruto: era respetuoso y soy insolente: era culto y me\r\n[15] encuentro salvaje. Usted me ha traído a este horrible\r\n     extremo, irritándome y apartándome del camino del bien\r\n     por donde tranquilamente iba. ¿De quién es la culpa, mía\r\n     o de usted?\r\n\r\n     --¡Tuya, tuya!\r\n\r\n[20] --Ni usted ni yo lo podemos resolver. Creo que ambos\r\n     carecemos de razón. En usted violencia e injusticia; en\r\n     mí injusticia y violencia. Hemos venido a ser tan bárbaro\r\n     el uno como el otro, y luchamos y nos herimos sin compasión.\r\n     Dios lo permite así. Mi sangre caerá sobre la\r\n[25] conciencia de usted, la de usted caerá sobre la mía.... Basta\r\n     ya, señora. No quiero molestar a usted con palabras\r\n     inútiles. Ahora entraremos en los hechos.\r\n\r\n     --¡En los hechos, bien!--dijo doña Perfecta más bien\r\n     rugiendo que hablando.--No creas que en Orbajosa falta\r\n[30] Guardia civil.\r\n\r\n     --Adiós, señora. Me retiro de esta casa. Creo que nos\r\n     volveremos a ver.\r\n\r\n     --Vete, vete, vete ya--gritó ella señalando la puerta con\r\n     enérgico ademán.\r\n\r\n     Pepe Rey salió. Doña Perfecta, después de pronunciar           143\r\n     algunas palabras incoherentes que eran la más clara\r\n     expresión de su ira, cayó en un sillón con muestras de cansancio\r\n     o de ataque nervioso. Acudieron las criadas.\r\n\r\n[5]  --¡Que vayan a llamar al Sr. D. Inocencio!--gritó.--Al\r\n     instante... ¡pronto!... ¡que venga!...\r\n\r\n     Después mordió el pañuelo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    XX\r\n\r\n                           =Rumores.--Temores=\r\n\r\n     Al día siguiente de esta disputa lamentable, corrieron\r\n     por toda Orbajosa de casa en casa, de círculo en círculo,\r\n[10] desde el Casino a la botica, y desde el paseo de las\r\n     Descalzas a la puerta de Baidejos, rumores varios sobre Pepe Rey\r\n     y su conducta. Todo el mundo los repetía, y los\r\n     comentarios iban siendo tantos, que si D. Cayetano los recogiese y\r\n     compilase, formaría con ellos un rico _Thesaurum_ de la\r\n[15] benevolencia orbajosense. En medio de la diversidad de\r\n     especies que corrían, había conformidad en algunos puntos\r\n     culminantes, uno de los cuales era el siguiente:\r\n\r\n     Que el ingeniero, enfurecido porque doña Perfecta se\r\n     negaba a casar a Rosario con un ateo, había _alzado la\r\n[20] mano_ a su tía.\r\n\r\n     Estaba viviendo el joven en la posada de la viuda de\r\n     Cuzco, establecimiento _montado_ como ahora se dice, no a la\r\n     altura, sino a la bajeza de los más primorosos atrasos del\r\n     país. Visitábale con frecuencia el teniente coronel\r\n[25] Pinzón, para ponerse de acuerdo respecto al enredo que entre\r\n     manos traían, y para cuyo eficaz desempeño mostraba el\r\n     soldado felices disposiciones. Ideaba a cada instante\r\n     nuevas travesuras y artimañas, apresurándose a llevarlas del\r\n     pensamiento a la obra con excelente humor, si bien solía\r\n[30] decir a su amigo:\r\n\r\n     --El papel que estoy haciendo, querido Pepe, no se debe        144\r\n     contar entre los más airosos; pero por dar un disgusto a\r\n     Orbajosa y su gente, andaría yo a cuatro pies.\r\n\r\n     No sabemos qué sutiles trazas empleó el ladino militar,\r\n[5]  maestro en ardides del mundo; pero lo cierto es que a los\r\n     tres días de alojamiento había logrado hacerse muy\r\n     simpático en la casa. Agradaba su trato a doña Perfecta, que no\r\n     podía oír sin emoción sus zalameras alabanzas del buen\r\n     porte de la casa, de la grandeza, piedad y magnificencia\r\n[10] augusta de la señora. Con D. Inocencio estaba a partir un\r\n     confite. Ni la madre, ni el Penitenciario le estorbaban que\r\n     hablase a Rosario (a quien se dió libertad después de la\r\n     ausencia del feroz primo); y con sus cortesanías\r\n     alambicadas, su hábil lisonja y destreza suma, adquirió en la casa\r\n[15] de Polentinos considerable auge y hasta familiaridad. Pero el\r\n     objeto de todas sus artes era una criada, que tenía por\r\n     nombre Librada, a quien sedujo (castamente hablando)\r\n     para que transportase recados y cartitas a Rosario,\r\n     fingiéndose enamorado de ésta. No resistió la muchacha al\r\n[20] soborno, realizado con bonitas palabras y mucho dinero,\r\n     porque ignoraba la procedencia de las esquelas y el\r\n     verdadero sentido de tales líos; pues si llegara a entender que\r\n     todo era una nueva diablura de D. José, aunque éste le\r\n     gustaba mucho, no hiciera traición a su señora por todo el\r\n[25] dinero del mundo.\r\n\r\n     Estaban un día en la huerta doña Perfecta, D. Inocencio,\r\n     Jacinto y Pinzón. Hablóse de la tropa y de la misión que\r\n     traía a Orbajosa, en cuyo tratado el señor Penitenciario\r\n     halló tema para condenar la tiránica conducta del Gobierno,\r\n[30] y, sin saber cómo, nombraron a Pepe Rey.\r\n\r\n     --Todavía está en la posada--dijo el abogadillo.--Le he\r\n     visto ayer, y me ha dado memorias para usted, doña Perfecta.\r\n\r\n     --¿Hase visto mayor insolencia?... ¡Ah! Sr. Pinzón,\r\n     no extrañe usted que emplee este lenguaje, tratándose de\r\n     un sobrino carnal... ya sabe usted... aquel caballerito        145\r\n     que se aposentaba en el cuarto que usted ocupa.\r\n\r\n     --¡Sí, ya lo sé! No le trato; pero le conozco de vista\r\n     y de fama. Es amigo íntimo de nuestro brigadier.\r\n\r\n[5]  --¿Amigo íntimo del brigadier?\r\n\r\n     --Sí, señora, del que manda la brigada que ha venido a\r\n     este país, y que se ha repartido entre diferentes pueblos.\r\n\r\n     --¿Y dónde está?--preguntó la dama.\r\n\r\n     --En Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n[10] --Creo que se aposenta en casa de Polavieja--indicó\r\n     Jacinto.\r\n\r\n     --Su sobrino de usted--continuó Pinzón,--y el\r\n     brigadier Batalla son íntimos amigos, se quieren entrañablemente,\r\n     y a todas horas se les ve juntos por las calles del pueblo.\r\n\r\n[15] --Pues, amiguito, mala idea formo de ese señor jefe--repuso\r\n     doña Perfecta.\r\n\r\n     --Es un... es un infeliz--dijo Pinzón en el tono\r\n     propio de quien por respeto no se atreve a aplicar una\r\n     calificación dura.\r\n\r\n[20] --Mejorando lo presente, Sr. Pinzón, y haciendo una\r\n     salvedad honrosísima en honor de usted--afirmó la señora--no\r\n     puede negarse que en el ejército español hay cada tipo....\r\n\r\n     --Nuestro brigadier era un excelente militar antes de\r\n     darse al espiritismo....\r\n\r\n[25] --¡Al espiritismo!\r\n\r\n     --¡Esa secta que llama a los fantasmas y duendes por\r\n     medio de las patas de las mesas!...--exclamó el\r\n     canónigo riendo.\r\n\r\n     --Por curiosidad, sólo por curiosidad--dijo Jacintillo\r\n[30] con énfasis,--he encargado a Madrid la obra de Allan\r\n     Cardec. Bueno es enterarse de todo.\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero es posible que tales disparates?... ¡Jesús!\r\n     Dígame usted, Pinzón, ¿mi sobrino también es de esa secta\r\n     de pie de banco?\r\n\r\n     --Me parece que él fué quien catequizó a nuestro bravo         146\r\n     brigadier Batalla.\r\n\r\n     --¡Pero, Jesús!\r\n\r\n     --Eso es; y cuando se le antoje--dijo don Inocencio\r\n[5]  sin poder contener la risa--hablará con Sócrates, San\r\n     Pablo, Cervántes y Descartes, como hablo yo ahora con\r\n     Librada para pedirle un fosforito. ¡Pobre Sr. de Rey!\r\n     Bien dije yo que aquella cabeza no estaba buena.\r\n\r\n     --Por lo demás--continuó Pinzón,--nuestro brigadier\r\n[10] es un buen militar. Si de algo peca es de excesivamente\r\n     duro. Toma tan al pie de la letra las órdenes del Gobierno,\r\n     que si le contrarían mucho aquí, será capaz de no dejar\r\n     piedra sobre piedra en Orbajosa. Sí, les prevengo a\r\n     ustedes que estén con cuidado.\r\n\r\n[15] --Pero ese monstruo nos va a cortar la cabeza a todos.\r\n     ¡Ay! Sr. D. Inocencio, estas visitas de la tropa me\r\n     recuerdan lo que he leído en la vida de los mártires, cuando se\r\n     presentaba un procónsul romano en un pueblo de cristianos....\r\n\r\n[20] --No deja de ser exacta la comparación--dijo el[20]\r\n     Penitenciario, mirando al militar por encima de las gafas.\r\n\r\n     --Es un poco triste; pero siendo verdad, debe decirse--manifestó\r\n     Pinzón con benevolencia.--Ahora, señores míos,\r\n     están ustedes a merced de nosotros.\r\n\r\n[25] --Las autoridades del país--objetó Jacinto,--funcionan\r\n     aún perfectamente.\r\n\r\n     --Creo que se equivoca usted--repuso el soldado, cuya\r\n     fisonomía observaban con profundo interés la señora y el\r\n     Penitenciario.--Hace una hora ha sido destituído el alcalde\r\n[30] de Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     --¿Por el gobernador de la provincia?\r\n\r\n     --El gobernador ha sido sustituído por un delegado del\r\n     Gobierno que debió llegar esta mañana. Los\r\n     Ayuntamientos todos cesarán hoy. Así lo ha mandado el ministro,\r\n     porque temía, no sé con qué motivo, que no prestaban apoyo     147\r\n     a la autoridad central.\r\n\r\n     --Bien, bien estamos--murmuró el canónigo frunciendo\r\n     el ceño y echando adelante el labio inferior.\r\n\r\n[5]  Doña Perfecta meditaba.\r\n\r\n     --También han sido quitados algunos jueces de primera\r\n     instancia, entre ellos el de Orbajosa.\r\n\r\n     --¡El juez! ¡Periquito!... ¿Ya no es juez\r\n     Periquito?--exclamó doña Perfecta con voz y gesto semejantes\r\n[10] a los de las personas que tienen la desgracia de ser picadas\r\n     por una víbora.\r\n\r\n     --Ya no es juez de Orbajosa el que lo era--dijo Pinzón.--Mañana\r\n     vendrá el nuevo.\r\n\r\n     --¡Un desconocido!\r\n\r\n[15] --¡Un desconocido!\r\n\r\n     --Un tunante quizás.... ¡El otro era tan honrado!...--dijo\r\n     la señora con zozobra.--Jamás le pedí cosa alguna\r\n     que al punto no me concediera. ¿Sabe usted quién será el\r\n     alcalde nuevo?\r\n\r\n[20] --Dicen que viene un corregidor.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, diga usted de una vez que viene el Diluvio, y\r\n     acabaremos--manifestó el canónigo levantándose.\r\n\r\n     --¿De modo que estamos a merced del señor brigadier?\r\n\r\n     --Por algunos días, ni más ni menos. No se enfaden\r\n[25] ustedes conmigo. A pesar de mi uniforme, soy enemigo del\r\n     militarismo; pero nos mandan pegar... y pegamos. No\r\n     puede haber oficio más canalla que el nuestro.\r\n\r\n     --Sí que lo es, sí que lo es--dijo la señora, disimulando\r\n     mal su furor.--Ya que usted lo ha confesado.... Con\r\n[30] que ni alcalde ni juez....\r\n\r\n     --Ni gobernador de la provincia.\r\n\r\n     --Que nos quiten también al señor obispo y nos manden\r\n     un monaguillo en su lugar.\r\n\r\n     --Es lo que falta.... Si aquí les dejan hacerlo--\r\n     murmuró D. Inocencio, bajando los ojos,--no se pararán         148\r\n     en pelillos.\r\n\r\n     --Y todo es porque se teme el levantamiento de partidas\r\n     en Orbajosa--exclamó la señora, cruzando las manos y\r\n[5]  agitándolas de arriba a bajo, desde la barba a las rodillas.\r\n     Francamente, Pinzón, no sé cómo no se levantan hasta las\r\n     piedras. No le deseo mal ninguno a usted; pero lo justo\r\n     sería que el agua que beben ustedes se les convirtiera en\r\n     lodo.... ¿Dijo usted que mi sobrino es íntimo amigo del\r\n[10] brigadier?\r\n\r\n     --Tan íntimo que no se separan en todo el día; fueron\r\n     compañeros de colegio. Batalla le quiere como un hermano\r\n     y le complace en todo. En su lugar de usted, señora, yo\r\n     no estaría tranquilo.\r\n\r\n[15] --¡Oh! ¡Dios mío! ¡Temo un atropello!...--exclamó\r\n     ella muy desasosegada.\r\n\r\n     --Señora--afirmó el canónigo con energía.--Antes que\r\n     consentir un atropello en esta honrada casa, antes que\r\n     consentir el menor vejamen hecho a esta nobilísima familia, yo\r\n[20] ... mi sobrino... los vecinos todos de Orbajosa....\r\n\r\n     Don Inocencio no concluyó. Su cólera era tan viva, que\r\n     se le trababan las palabras en la boca. Dió algunos pasos\r\n     marciales, y después se volvió a sentar.\r\n\r\n     --Me parece que no son vanos esos temores--dijo\r\n[25] Pinzón.--En caso necesario yo....\r\n\r\n     --Y yo....--repitió Jacinto.\r\n\r\n     Doña Perfecta había fijado los ojos en la puerta vidriera\r\n     del comedor, tras la cual dejóse ver una graciosa figura.\r\n     Mirándola, parecía que en el semblante de la señora se\r\n[30] ennegrecían más las sombrías nubes del temor.\r\n\r\n     --Rosario, pasa aquí, Rosario--dijo saliendo a su\r\n     encuentro.--Se me figura que tienes hoy mejor cara y estás\r\n     más alegre, sí.... ¿No les parece a ustedes que Rosario\r\n     tiene mejor cara? Si parece otra.\r\n\r\n     Todos convinieron en que tenía retratada en su semblante       149\r\n     la más viva felicidad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XXI\r\n\r\n                            =Desperta, ferro=\r\n\r\n     Por aquellos días publicaron los periódicos de Madrid\r\n     las siguientes noticias:\r\n\r\n[5]  \"No es cierto que en los alrededores de Orbajosa se haya\r\n     levantado partida alguna. Nos escriben de aquella\r\n     localidad que el país está tan poco dispuesto a aventuras, que se\r\n     considera inútil en aquel punto la presencia de la brigada\r\n     Batalla.\"\r\n\r\n[10] \"Dícese que la brigada Batalla saldrá de Orbajosa,\r\n     porque no hacen falta allí fuerzas del ejército, e irá a Villajuán\r\n     de Nahara, donde han aparecido algunas partidas.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Ya es seguro que los Aceros recorren con algunos\r\n     ginetes el término de Villajuán, próximo al distrito judicial de\r\n[15] Orbajosa. El gobernador de la provincia de X... ha\r\n     telegrafiado al Gobierno diciendo que Francisco Acero\r\n     entró en las Roquetas, donde cobró un semestre y pidió\r\n     raciones. Domingo Acero (Faltriquera) vagaba por la\r\n     sierra del Jubileo, activamente perseguido por la Guardia\r\n[20] civil, que le mató un hombre y aprehendió a otro.\r\n     Bartolomé Acero fué el que quemó el registro civil de Lugarnoble,\r\n     llevándose en rehenes al alcalde y a dos de los principales\r\n     propietarios.\"\r\n\r\n     \"En Orbajosa reina tranquilidad completa, según carta\r\n[25] que tenemos a la vista, y allí no piensan más que en\r\n     trabajar el campo para la próxima cosecha de ajos, que promete\r\n     ser magnífica. Los distritos inmediatos sí están infestados\r\n     de partidas; pero la brigada Batalla dará buena cuenta de\r\n     ellas.\"\r\n\r\n     En efecto; Orbajosa estaba tranquila.--Los Aceros,             150\r\n     aquella dinastía aguerrida, merecedora, según algunas gentes,\r\n     de figurar en el _Romancero_, había tomado por su cuenta la\r\n     provincia cercana; pero la insurrección no cundía en el\r\n[5]  término de la ciudad episcopal. Creeríase que la cultura\r\n     moderna había al fin vencido en su lucha con las levantiscas\r\n     costumbres de la gran behetría, y que ésta saboreaba las\r\n     delicias de una paz duradera. Y esto es tan cierto, que el\r\n     mismo Caballuco, una de las figuras más caracterizadas de\r\n[10] la rebeldía histórica de Orbajosa, decía claramente a todo\r\n     el mundo que él no quería _reñir con el Gobierno_ ni _meterse en\r\n     danzas_ que podían costarle caras.\r\n\r\n     Dígase lo que se quiera, el arrebatado carácter de Ramos\r\n     había tomado asiento con los años, enfriándose un poco la\r\n[15] fogosidad que con la existencia recibiera de los Caballucos\r\n     padres y abuelos, la mejor casta de guerreros que ha asolado\r\n     la tierra. Cuéntase además que por aquellos días el nuevo\r\n     gobernador de la provincia _celebró una conferencia_ con este\r\n     importante personaje, _oyendo de sus labios las mayores\r\n[20] seguridades_ de contribuir al reposo público y evitar toda ocasión\r\n     de disturbios. Aseguran fieles testigos que se le veía en\r\n     amor y compaña con los militares, partiendo un piñón con\r\n     este o el otro sargento en la taberna, y hasta se dijo que le\r\n     iban a dar un buen destino en el Ayuntamiento de la capital\r\n[25] de la provincia. ¡Oh! cuán difícil es para el historiador,\r\n     que presume de imparcial, depurar la verdad en esto de las\r\n     opiniones y pensamientos de los insignes personajes que\r\n     han llenado el mundo con su nombre! No sabe uno a qué\r\n     atenerse, y la falta de datos ciertos da origen a lamentables\r\n[30] equivocaciones. En presencia de hechos tan culminantes\r\n     como la jornada de Brumario, como el saco de Roma por\r\n     Borbón, como la ruina de Jerusalén, ¿qué psicólogo, ni qué\r\n     historiador podrá determinar los pensamientos que les\r\n     precedieron o les siguieron en la cabeza de Bonaparte, Carlos\r\n     V y Tito?--¡Responsabilidad inmensa la nuestra! Para           151\r\n     librarnos en parte de ella, refiramos palabras, frases y aun\r\n     discursos del mismo emperador orbajosense, y de este modo\r\n     cada cual formará la opinión que le parezca más acertada.\r\n\r\n[5]  No cabe duda alguna de que Cristóbal Ramos salió, ya\r\n     anochecido, de su casa, y atravesando por la calle del\r\n     Condestable, vió tres labriegos que en sendas mulas venían en\r\n     dirección contraria a la suya, y preguntándoles que a dó\r\n     caminaban, repusieron que a la casa de la señora doña\r\n[10] Perfecta a llevarle varias primicias de frutos de las huertas y\r\n     algún dinero de las rentas vencidas. Eran el señor\r\n     Pasolargo, un mozo a quien llamaban Frasquito González, y el\r\n     tercero, de mediana edad y recia complexión, recibía el\r\n     nombre de Vejarruco, aunque el suyo verdadero era José\r\n[15] Esteban Romero. Volvió atrás Caballuco, solicitado por\r\n     la buena compañía de aquella gente, con quien tenía franca\r\n     y antigua amistad, y entró con ellos en casa de la señora.\r\n     Esto ocurría, según los más verosímiles datos, al anochecer,\r\n     y dos días después de aquél en que doña Perfecta y Pinzón\r\n[20] hablaron lo que en el anterior capítulo ha podido ver quien\r\n     lo ha leído. Entretúvose el gran Ramos dando a Librada\r\n     ciertos recados de poca importancia que una vecina confiara\r\n     a su buena memoria, y cuando entró en el comedor ya los\r\n     tres labriegos antes mencionados y el señor Licurgo, que\r\n[25] asimismo por singular coincidencia estaba presente, habían\r\n     entablado conversación sobre asuntos de la cosecha y de la\r\n     casa. La señora tenía un humor endiablado; a todo ponía\r\n     faltas, y reprendíales ásperamente por la sequía del cielo y\r\n     la infecundidad de la tierra, fenómenos de que ellos los\r\n[30] pobrecitos no tenían culpa. Presenciaba la escena el Sr.\r\n     Penitenciario. Cuando entró Caballuco, saludóle\r\n     afectuosamente el buen canónigo, señalándole un asiento a su lado.\r\n\r\n     --Aquí está el personaje--dijo la señora con desdén.--¡Parece\r\n     mentira que se hable tanto de un hombre de tan\r\n     poco valer! Dime, Caballuco, ¿es verdad que te han dado        152\r\n     de bofetadas unos soldados esta mañana?\r\n\r\n     --¡A mí! ¡A mí!--dijo el Centauro levantándose\r\n     indignado cual si recibiera el más grosero insulto.\r\n\r\n[5]  --Así lo han dicho--añadió la señora.--¿No es verdad?\r\n     Yo lo creí, porque quien en tan poco se tiene.... Te\r\n     escupirán, y tú te creerás honrado con la saliva de los\r\n     militares.\r\n\r\n     --¡Señora!--vociferó Ramos con energía.--Salvo el\r\n[10] respeto que debo a usted, que es mi madre, más que mi\r\n     madre, mi señora, mi reina... pues digo que salvo el\r\n     respeto que debo a la persona que me ha dado todo lo que\r\n     tengo... salvo el respeto....\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué?... Parece que vas a decir mucho y no dices\r\n[15] nada.\r\n\r\n     --Pues digo que salvo el respeto, eso de la bofetada es\r\n     una calumnia--añadió, expresándose con extraordinaria\r\n     dificultad.--Todos hablan de mí, que si entro o si salgo,\r\n     que si voy, que si vengo.... Y todo, ¿por qué? Porque\r\n[20] quieren tomarme por figurón para que revuelva el país.\r\n     Bien está Pedro en su casa, señoras y caballeros. ¿Que\r\n     ha venido la tropa?... malo es; ¿pero qué le vamos a\r\n     hacer?... ¿Que han quitado al alcalde y al secretario y\r\n     al juez?... malo es; yo quisiera que se levantaran contra\r\n[25] ellos las piedras de Orbajosa; pero di mi palabra al\r\n     gobernador, y hasta ahora yo....\r\n\r\n     Rascóse la cabeza, frunció el adusto ceño, y con lengua\r\n     cada vez más torpe, prosiguió así:\r\n\r\n     --Yo seré bruto, pesado, ignorante, querencioso, testarudo\r\n[30] y todo lo que quieran; pero a caballero no me gana nadie.\r\n\r\n     --Lástima de Cid Campeador--dijo con el mayor\r\n     desprecio doña Perfecta.--¿No cree usted, como yo, señor\r\n     Penitenciario, que en Orbajosa no hay ya un solo hombre\r\n     que tenga vergüenza?\r\n\r\n     --Grave opinión es ésa--repuso el capitular, sin mirar         153\r\n     a su amiga ni apartar de su barba la mano en que apoyaba\r\n     el-meditabundo rostro.--Pero se me figura que este vecindario\r\n     ha aceptado con excesiva sumisión el pesado yugo del\r\n[5]  militarismo.\r\n\r\n     Licurgo y los tres labradores reían con toda su alma.\r\n\r\n     --Cuando los soldados y las autoridades nuevas--dijo\r\n     la señora,--nos hayan llevado el último real, después de\r\n     deshonrado el pueblo, enviaremos a Madrid, en una urna de\r\n[10] cristal, a todos los valientes de Orbajosa para que los\r\n     pongan en el Museo o les enseñen por las calles.\r\n\r\n     --¡Viva la señora!--exclamó con vivo ademán el que\r\n     llamaban Vejarruco.--Lo que ha dicho es como el oro.\r\n     No se dirá por mí que no hay valientes, pues no estoy con\r\n[15] los Aceros por aquello de que tiene uno tres hijos y mujer\r\n     y puede suceder cualquier estropicio; que si no....\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero tú no has dado tu palabra al gobernador?--le\r\n     preguntó la señora.\r\n\r\n     --¡Al gobernador!--exclamó el nombrado Frasquito\r\n[20] González.--No hay en todo el país tunante que más merezca\r\n     un tiro. Gobernador y Gobierno, todos son lo mismo. El\r\n     cura nos predicó el domingo tantas cosas altisonantes sobre\r\n     las herejías y ofensas a la religión que hacen en Madrid....\r\n     ¡Oh! había que oírle.... Al fin dió muchos gritos en el\r\n[25] púlpito, diciendo que la religión ya no tenía defensores.\r\n\r\n     --Aquí está el gran Cristóbal Ramos--dijo la señora,\r\n     dando fuerte palmada en el hombro del Centauro.--Monta\r\n     a caballo; se pasea en la plaza y en el camino real, para\r\n     llamar la atención de los soldados; venle éstos, se espantan\r\n[30] de la fiera catadura del héroe y echan todos a correr\r\n     muertos de miedo.\r\n\r\n     La señora terminó su frase con una risa exagerada que\r\n     se hacía más chocante por el profundo silencio de los que\r\n     la oían. Caballuco estaba pálido.\r\n\r\n     --Señor Pasolargo--continuó la dama, poniéndose seria,--esta   154\r\n     noche, cuando vaya usted a su casa, mándeme acá a\r\n     su hijo Bartolomé para que se quede aquí. Necesito tener\r\n     buena gente en casa; y aun así, bien podrá suceder que el\r\n[5]  mejor día amanezcamos mi hija y yo asesinadas.\r\n\r\n     --¡Señora!--exclamaron todos.\r\n\r\n     --¡Señora!--gritó Caballuco levantándose.--¿Eso es\r\n     broma o qué es?\r\n\r\n     --Señor Vejarruco, Sr. Pasolargo--continuó la señora,\r\n[10] sin mirar al bravo de la localidad;--no estoy segura en mi\r\n     casa. Ningún vecino de Orbajosa lo está, y menos yo.\r\n     Vivo con el alma en un hilo. No puedo pegar los ojos en\r\n     toda la noche.\r\n\r\n     --Pero ¿quién, quién se atreverá?...\r\n\r\n[15] --Vamos--exclamó Licurgo con ardor,--que yo, viejo\r\n     y enfermo, seré capaz de batirme con todo el ejército\r\n     español si tocan el pelo de la ropa a la señora....\r\n\r\n     --Con el Sr. Caballuco--dijo Frasquito González,--basta\r\n     y sobra.\r\n\r\n[20] --¡Oh! no--repuso doña Perfecta con cruel sarcasmo.--No\r\n     ven ustedes que Ramos ha dado su palabra al\r\n     Gobernador....\r\n\r\n     Caballuco volvió a sentarse, y poniendo una pierna sobre\r\n     otra, cruzó las manos sobre ellas.\r\n\r\n[25] --Me basta un cobarde--añadió implacablemente el\r\n     ama,--con tal que no haya dado palabras. Quizás pase\r\n     yo por el trance de ver asaltada mi casa, de ver que me\r\n     arrancan de los brazos a mi querida hija, de verme\r\n     atropellada e insultada del modo más infame....\r\n\r\n[30] No pudo continuar. La voz se ahogó en su garganta y\r\n     rompió a llorar desconsoladamente.\r\n\r\n     --¡Señora, por Dios, cálmese usted!... Vamos...\r\n     no hay motivo todavía....--dijo precipitadamente y con\r\n     semblante y voz de aflicción suma D. Inocencio.--También\r\n     es preciso un poquito de resignación para soportar las         155\r\n     calamidades que Dios me envía.\r\n\r\n     --Pero ¿quién... señora? ¿Quién se atreverá a tales\r\n     vituperios?--preguntó uno de los cuatro.--Orbajosa toda\r\n[5]  se pondría sobre un pie para defender a la señora.\r\n\r\n     --Pero ¿quién, quién?--repitieron todos.\r\n\r\n     --Vaya, no la molesten ustedes con preguntas\r\n     importunas--dijo con oficiosidad el Penitenciario.--Pueden\r\n     retirarse.\r\n\r\n[10] --No, no, que se queden--manifestó vivamente la\r\n     señora, secando sus lágrimas.--La compañía de mis buenos\r\n     servidores es para mí un gran consuelo.\r\n\r\n     --Maldita sea mi casta--dijo el tío Lucas, dándose un\r\n     puñetazo en la rodilla,--si todos estos gatuperios no son\r\n[15] obra del mismísimo sobrino de la señora.\r\n\r\n     --¿Del hijo de D. Juan Rey?\r\n\r\n     --Desde que le vi en la estación de Villahorrenda y me\r\n     habló con su voz melosilla y sus mimos de hombre cortesano--\r\n     manifestó Licurgo,--le tuve por un grandísimo... no\r\n[20] quiero acabar por respeto a la señora.... Pero yo le\r\n     conocí... le señalé desde aquel día, y yo no me equivoco.\r\n     Sé muy bien, como dijo el otro, que por el hilo se saca el\r\n     ovillo, por la muestra se conoce el paño, y por la uña el león.\r\n\r\n     --No se hable mal en mi presencia de ese desdichado\r\n[25] joven--dijo la de Polentinos severamente.--Por grandes\r\n     que sean sus faltas, la caridad nos prohibe hablar de ellas y\r\n     darles publicidad.\r\n\r\n     --Pero la caridad--manifestó D. Inocencio con cierta\r\n     energía,--no nos impide precavernos contra los malos; y\r\n[30] de eso se trata. Ya que han decaído tanto los caracteres\r\n     y el valor en la desdichada Orbajosa; ya que este pueblo\r\n     parece dispuesto a poner la cara para que escupan en ella\r\n     cuatro soldados y un cabo, busquemos alguna defensa\r\n     uniéndonos.\r\n\r\n     --Yo me defenderé como pueda--dijo con resignación             156\r\n     y cruzando las manos doña Perfecta.--¡Hágase la\r\n     voluntad del Señor!\r\n\r\n     --Tanto ruido para nada.... ¡Por vida de!... ¡En\r\n[5]  esta casa son de la piel del miedo!...--exclamó\r\n     Caballuco, entre serio y festivo.--No parece sino que el tal D.\r\n     Pepito es una _región_ (léase legión) de demonios. No se\r\n     asuste usted, señora mía. Mi sobrinillo Juan, que tiene\r\n     trece años, guardará la casa, y veremos, sobrino por sobrino,\r\n[10] quién puede más.\r\n\r\n     --Ya sabemos todos lo que significan tus guapezas y\r\n     valentías--replicó la dama.--¡Pobre Ramos, quieres\r\n     echártela de bravucón cuando ya se ha visto que no vales\r\n     para nada!\r\n\r\n[15] Ramos palideció ligeramente, fijando en la señora una\r\n     mirada singular en que se confundían el espanto y el respeto.\r\n\r\n     --Sí, hombre, no me mires así. Ya sabes que no me\r\n     asusto de fantasmones. ¿Quieres que te hable de una vez\r\n     con claridad? Pues eres un cobarde.\r\n\r\n[20] Ramos, moviéndose como el que tiene por diversas partes\r\n     de su cuerpo molestas picazones, demostraba gran\r\n     desasosiego. Su nariz expelía y recogía el aire como la de un\r\n     caballo. Dentro de aquel corpachón combatía consigo\r\n     misma por echarse fuera rugiendo y destrozando, una\r\n[25] tormenta, una pasión, una barbaridad. Después de modular\r\n     a medias algunas palabras, mascando otras, levantóse y\r\n     bramó de esta manera:\r\n\r\n     --¡Le cortaré la cabeza al Sr. Rey!\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué desatino! Eres tan bruto como cobarde--dijo\r\n[30] palideciendo la señora.--¿Qué hablas ahí de matar, si yo\r\n     no quiero que maten a nadie, y mucho menos a mi sobrino,\r\n     persona a quien amo a pesar de sus maldades?\r\n\r\n     --¡El homicidio! ¡Qué atrocidad!--exclamó el Sr. D.\r\n     Inocencio escandalizado.--Ese hombre está loco.\r\n\r\n     --¡Matar!... La idea tan sólo de un homicidio me               157\r\n     horroriza, Caballuco--dijo la señora cerrando los dulces\r\n     ojos.--¡Pobre hombre! Desde que has querido mostrar\r\n     valentía, has aullado como un lobo carnicero. Vete de\r\n[5]  aquí, Ramos; me causas espanto.\r\n\r\n     --¿No dice la señora que tiene miedo? ¿No dice que\r\n     atropellarán la casa, que robarán a la niña?\r\n\r\n     --Sí, lo temo.\r\n\r\n     --Y eso lo ha de hacer un solo hombre--dijo Ramos\r\n[10] con desprecio volviendo a sentarse.--Eso lo ha de hacer\r\n     D. Pepe Poquita Cosa con sus matemáticas. Hice mal en\r\n     decir que le rebanaría el pescuezo. A un muñeco de ese\r\n     estambre, se le coge de una oreja y se le echa de remojo en\r\n     el río.\r\n\r\n[15] --Sí, ríete ahora, bestia. No es mi sobrino solo quien\r\n     ha de cometer todos esos desafueros que has mencionado y\r\n     que yo temo; pues si fuese él solo no le temería.\r\n     Mandaría a Librada que se pusiera en la puerta con una escoba\r\n     ... y bastaba.... No es él solo, no.\r\n\r\n[20] --¿Pues quién?\r\n\r\n     --Hazte el borrico. ¿No sabes tú que mi sobrino y el\r\n     brigadier que manda esa condenada tropa se han\r\n     confabulado?...\r\n\r\n     --¡Confabulado!--exclamó Caballuco demostrando no\r\n[25] entender la palabra.\r\n\r\n     --Que están de compinche--dijo Licurgo.--Fabulearse\r\n     quiere decir estar de compinche. Ya me barruntaba yo lo\r\n     que dice la señora.\r\n\r\n     --Todo se reduce a que el brigadier y los oficiales son\r\n[30] uña y carne de D. José, y lo que él quiera lo quieren esos\r\n     soldadotes, y esos soldadotes harán toda clase de atropellos\r\n     y barbaridades, porque ese es su oficio.\r\n\r\n     --Y no tenemos alcalde que nos ampare.\r\n\r\n     --Ni juez.\r\n\r\n     --Ni gobernador. Es decir, que estamos a merced de             158\r\n     esa infame gentuza.\r\n\r\n     --Ayer--dijo Vejarruco,--unos soldados se llevaron\r\n     engañada a la hija más chica del tío Julián, y la pobre no\r\n[5]  se atrevió a volver a su casa; mas la encontraron llorando\r\n     y descalza junto a la fuentecilla vieja, recogiendo los\r\n     pedazos de la cántara rota.\r\n\r\n     --¡Pobre D. Gregorio Palomeque! el escribano de\r\n     Naharilla Alta--dijo Frasquito.--Estos pillos le robaron todo\r\n[10] el dinero que tenía en su casa. Pero el brigadier, cuando\r\n     se lo contaron, contestó que era mentira.\r\n\r\n     --Tiranos, más tiranos no nacieron de madre--manifestó\r\n     el otro.--¡Cuando digo que por punto no estoy con\r\n     los Aceros!...\r\n\r\n[15] --¿Y qué se sabe de Francisco Acero?--preguntó\r\n     mansamente doña Perfecta.--Sentiría que le ocurriera algún\r\n     percance. Dígame usted, D. Inocencio, ¿Francisco Acero\r\n     no nació en Orbajosa?\r\n\r\n     --No; él y su hermano son de Villajuán.\r\n\r\n[20] --Lo siento por Orbajosa--dijo doña Perfecta.--Esta\r\n     pobre ciudad ha entrado en desgracia. ¿Sabe usted si\r\n     Francisco Acero dió palabra al gobernador de no molestar\r\n     a los pobres soldaditos en sus robos de doncellas, en sus\r\n     irreligiosidades, en sus sacrilegios, en sus infames felonías?\r\n\r\n[25] Caballuco dió un salto. Ya no se sentía punzado, sino\r\n     herido por atroz sablazo. Encendido el rostro y con los\r\n     ojos llenos de fuego, gritó de este modo:\r\n\r\n     --Yo di mi palabra al gobernador, porque el gobernador\r\n     me dijo que venían con buen fin.\r\n\r\n[30] --Bárbaro, no grites. Habla como la gente y te\r\n     escucharemos.\r\n\r\n     --Yo prometí que ni yo ni ninguno de mis amigos\r\n     levantaríamos partidas en tierra de Orbajosa.... A todo el que\r\n     ha querido salir porque le retozaba la guerra en el cuerpo,\r\n     le he dicho: _Vete con los Aceros, que aquí no nos movemos_.   159\r\n     Pero tengo mucha gente honrada, sí señora, y buena, sí\r\n     señora, y valiente, sí señora, que está desperdigada por los\r\n     caseríos y las aldeas y los arrabales y los montes, cada uno\r\n[5]  en su casa, ¿eh? Y en cuanto yo les diga la mitad de media\r\n     palabra, ¿eh? ya están todos descolgando las escopetas,\r\n     ¿eh? y echando a correr a caballo o a pie para ir a donde\r\n     yo les mande.... Y no me anden con gramáticas, que si\r\n     yo di mi palabra, fué porque la di, y si no salgo es porque\r\n[10] no quiero salir, y si quiero que haya partidas las habrá, y si\r\n     no quiero, no; porque yo soy quien soy, el mismo hombre\r\n     de siempre, bien lo saben todos.... Y digo otra vez que\r\n     no vengan con gramáticas, ¿estamos?... y que no me\r\n     digan las cosas al revés, ¿estamos?... y si quieren que\r\n[15] salga me lo declaren con toda la boca abierta, ¿estamos?\r\n     ... porque para eso nos ha dado Dios la lengua, para\r\n     decir esto y aquello. Bien sabe la señora quien soy, así\r\n     como bien sé yo que le debo la camisa que me pongo, y el\r\n     pan que cómo hoy, y el primer garbanzo que chupé cuando\r\n[20] me despecharon, y la caja en que enterraron a mi padre\r\n     cuando murió, y las medicinas y el médico que me pusieron\r\n     bueno cuando estuve enfermo; y bien sabe la señora que\r\n     si ella me dice: \"Caballuco, rómpete la cabeza,\" voy a aquel\r\n     rincón y contra la pared me la rompo; bien sabe la señora\r\n[25] que si ahora dice ella que es de día, yo, aunque vea la\r\n     noche, creeré que me equivoco y que es claro día; bien\r\n     sabe la señora que ella y su hacienda son antes que mi vida,\r\n     y que si delante de mí la pica un mosquito, le perdono\r\n     porque es mosquito; bien sabe la señora que la quiero más\r\n[30] que a cuanto hay debajo del sol.... A un hombre de\r\n     tanto corazón se le dice: \"Caballuco, so animal, haz esto\r\n     o lo otro,\"... y basta de ritólicas y mete y saca de\r\n     palabrejas y sermoncillos al revés y pincha por aquí y pellizca\r\n     por allá.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, hombre, sosiégate--dijo doña Perfecta con             160\r\n     bondad.--Te has sofocado como aquellos oradores\r\n     republicanos que venían a predicar aquí la religión libre, el amor\r\n     libre y no sé cuántas cosas libres.... Que te traigan un\r\n[5]  vaso de agua.\r\n\r\n     Caballuco hizo con el pañuelo una especie de rodilla,\r\n     apretado envoltorio o más bien pelota, y se lo pasó por la\r\n     ancha frente y cogote para limpiarse ambas partes,\r\n     cubiertas de sudor. Trajéronle un vaso de agua, y el señor\r\n[10] canónigo, con una mansedumbre que cuadraba perfectamente a\r\n     su carácter sacerdotal, lo tomó de manos de la criada para\r\n     presentárselo y sostener el plato mientras bebía. El agua\r\n     se escurría por el gaznate de Caballuco, produciendo un\r\n     claqueteo sonoro.\r\n\r\n[15] --Ahora tráigame usted otro a mí, señora Librada--dijo\r\n     D. Inocencio.--También tengo un poco de fuego dentro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXII.\r\n\r\n                              =¡Desperta!=\r\n\r\n     --Respecto a lo de las partidas--dijo doña Perfecta\r\n     cuando concluyeron de beber,--sólo te digo que hagas lo\r\n     que tu conciencia te dicte.\r\n\r\n[20] --Yo no entiendo de ditados--gritó Ramos.--Haré lo\r\n     que sea del gusto de la señora.\r\n\r\n     --Pues yo no te aconsejaré nada en asunto tan grave--repuso\r\n     ella con la circunspección y comedimiento que tan\r\n     bien le sentaban.--Eso es muy grave, gravísimo, y yo no\r\n[25] puedo aconsejarte nada.\r\n\r\n     --Pero el parecer de usted....\r\n\r\n     --Mi parecer es que abras los ojos y veas, que abras los\r\n     oídos y oigas.... Consulta tu corazón... yo te concedo\r\n     que tienes un gran corazón.... Consulta a ese juez, a\r\n[30] ese consejero que tanto sabe, y haz lo que él te mande.\r\n\r\n     Caballuco meditó, pensó todo lo que puede pensar una           161\r\n     espada.\r\n\r\n     --Los de Naharilla Alta--dijo Vejarruco,--nos\r\n     contamos ayer y éramos trece, propios para cualquier cosita\r\n[5]  mayor.... Pero como temíamos que la señora se\r\n     enfadara, no hicimos nada. Es tiempo ya de trasquilar.\r\n\r\n     --No te preocupes de la trasquila--dijo la señora.--Tiempo\r\n     hay. No se dejará de hacer por eso.\r\n\r\n     --Mis dos muchachos--manifestó Licurgo--riñeron ayer\r\n[10] el uno con el otro, porque uno quería irse con Francisco\r\n     Acero y el otro no. Yo les dije: \"Despacio, hijos míos,\r\n     que todo se andará. Esperad, que tan buen pan hacen\r\n     aquí como en Francia.\"\r\n\r\n     --Anoche me dijo Roque Pelosmalos--manifestó el tío\r\n[15] Pasolargo,--que en cuanto el Sr. Ramos dijera tanto así,\r\n     ya estaban todos con las armas en la mano. ¡Qué lástima\r\n     que los dos hermanos Burguillos se hayan ido a labrar las\r\n     tierras de Lugarnoble!\r\n\r\n     --Vaya usted a buscarlos--dijo el ama vivamente.--Sr.\r\n[20] Lucas, proporciónele usted un caballo al tío Pasolargo.\r\n\r\n     --Yo, si la señora me lo manda, y el señor Ramos también--dijo\r\n     Frasquito González,--iré a Villahorrenda a ver\r\n     si Robustiano, el guarda de montes y su hermano Pedro\r\n     quieren también....\r\n\r\n[25] --Me parece buena idea. Robustiano no se atreve a\r\n     venir a Orbajosa, porque me debe un piquillo. Puedes\r\n     decirle que le perdono los seis duros y medio.... Esta\r\n     pobre gente, que tan generosamente sabe sacrificarse por\r\n     una buena idea, se contenta con tan poco.... ¿No es\r\n[30] verdad, Sr. D. Inocencio?\r\n\r\n     --Aquí nuestro buen Ramos--repuso el canónigo,--me\r\n     dice que sus amigos están descontentos con él por su\r\n     tibieza; pero que en cuanto le vean determinado se\r\n     pondrán todos la canana al cinto.\r\n\r\n     --Pero qué, ¿estás determinado a echarte a la calle?--dijo     162\r\n     la señora.--No te he aconsejado yo tal cosa, y si lo\r\n     haces es por tu voluntad. Tampoco el Sr. D. Inocencio te\r\n     habrá dicho una palabra en este sentido. Pero cuando tú\r\n[5]  lo decides así, razones muy poderosas tendrás.... Dime,\r\n     Cristóbal, ¿quieres cenar? ¿quieres tomar algo?... con\r\n     franqueza....\r\n\r\n     --En cuanto a que yo aconseje al Sr. Ramos que se eche\r\n     al campo--dijo D. Inocencio, mirando por encima de los\r\n[10] cristales de sus anteojos,--razón tiene la señora. Yo,\r\n     como sacerdote, no puedo aconsejar tal cosa. Sé que\r\n     algunos lo hacen; y aun toman las armas; pero esto me parece\r\n     impropio, muy impropio, y no seré yo quien los imite.\r\n     Llevo mi escrupulosidad hasta el extremo de no decir una\r\n[15] palabra al Sr. Ramos sobre la peliaguda cuestión de su\r\n     levantamiento en armas. Yo sé que Orbajosa lo desea; sé\r\n     que le bendecirán todos los habitantes de esta noble ciudad;\r\n     sé que vamos a tener aquí hazañas dignas de pasar a la\r\n     historia; pero, sin embargo, permítaseme un discreto\r\n[20] silencio.\r\n\r\n     --Está muy bien dicho--añadió doña Perfecta.--No\r\n     me gusta que los sacerdotes se mezclen en tales asuntos.\r\n     Un clérigo ilustrado debe conducirse de este modo. Bien\r\n     sabemos que en circunstancias solemnes y graves, por\r\n[25] ejemplo, cuando peligran la patria y la fe, están los\r\n     sacerdotes en su terreno incitando a los hombres a la lucha y\r\n     aun figurando en ella. Pues que Dios mismo ha tomado\r\n     parte en célebres batallas, bajo la forma de ángeles o santos,\r\n     bien pueden sus ministros hacerlo. Durante la guerra contra\r\n[30] los infieles, ¿cuántos obispos acaudillaron las tropas\r\n     castellanas?\r\n\r\n     --Muchos, y algunos fueron insignes guerreros. Pero\r\n     estos tiempos no son como aquellos, señora. Verdad es\r\n     que si vamos a mirar atentamente las cosas, la fe peligra\r\n     ahora más que antes.... ¿Pues qué representan esos             163\r\n     ejércitos que ocupan nuestra ciudad y pueblos inmediatos?\r\n     ¿qué representan? ¿Son otra cosa más que el infame\r\n     instrumento de que se valen para sus pérfidas conquistas\r\n[5]  y el exterminio de las creencias, los ateos y protestantes de\r\n     que está infestado Madrid?... Bien lo sabemos todos.\r\n     En aquel centro de corrupción, de escándalo, de\r\n     irreligiosidad y descreimiento, unos cuantos hombres malignos,\r\n     comprados por el oro extranjero, se emplean en destruir en\r\n[10] nuestra España la semilla de la fe.... ¿Pues qué creen\r\n     ustedes? Nos dejan a nosotros decir misa y a ustedes\r\n     oírla por un resto de consideración, por vergüenza... pero\r\n     el mejor día.... Por mi parte, estoy tranquilo. Soy un\r\n     hombre que no se apura por ningún interés temporal y\r\n[15] mundano. Bien lo sabe la señora doña Perfecta, bien lo\r\n     saben todos los que me conocen. Estoy tranquilo y no me\r\n     asusta el triunfo de los malvados. Sé muy bien que nos\r\n     aguardan días terribles; que cuantos vestimos el hábito\r\n     sacerdotal tenemos la vida pendiente de un cabello, porque\r\n[20] España, no lo duden ustedes, presenciará escenas como\r\n     aquellas de la revolución francesa, en que perecieron miles\r\n     de sacerdotes piadosísimos en un mismo día.... Mas no\r\n     me apuro. Cuando toquen a degollar presentaré mi cuello;\r\n     ya he vivido bastante. ¿Para qué sirvo yo? Para nada,\r\n[25] para nada.\r\n\r\n     --Comido de perros me vea yo--exclamó Vejarruco,\r\n     mostrando el puño, no menos duro y fuerte que un martillo,--si\r\n     no acabamos pronto con toda esa canalla ladrona.\r\n\r\n     --Dicen que la semana que viene comienza el derribo\r\n[30] de la catedral--indicó Frasquito.\r\n\r\n     --Supongo que la derribarán con picos y martillos--dijo\r\n     el canónigo sonriendo.--Hay artífices que no tienen esas\r\n     herramientas, y sin embargo adelantan más edificando.\r\n     Bien saben ustedes que, según tradición piadosa, nuestra\r\n     hermosa capilla del Sagrario fué derribada por los moros en    164\r\n     un mes y reedificada en seguida por los ángeles en una sola\r\n     noche.... Dejarles, dejarles que derriben.\r\n\r\n     --En Madrid, según nos contó la otra noche el cura de\r\n[5]  Naharilla--dijo Vejarruco,--ya quedan tan pocas iglesias,\r\n     que algunos curas dicen misa en medio de la calle, y como\r\n     les aporrean y les dicen injurias y también les escupen,\r\n     muchos no la quieren decir.\r\n\r\n     --Felizmente aquí, hijos míos--manifestó D. Inocencio,--no\r\n[10] hemos tenido aún escenas de esa naturaleza. ¿Por\r\n     qué? Porque saben qué clase de gente sois; porque tienen\r\n     noticia de vuestra piedad ardiente y de vuestro valor....\r\n     No les arriendo la ganancia a los primeros que pongan la\r\n     mano en nuestros sacerdotes y en nuestro culto.... Por\r\n[15] supuesto, dicho se está que si no se les ataja a tiempo,\r\n     harán diabluras. ¡Pobre España, tan santa y tan humilde\r\n     y tan buena! ¡Quién había de decir que llegarían a estos\r\n     apurados extremos!... Pero yo sostengo que la\r\n     impiedad no triunfará, no señor. Todavía hay gente valerosa,\r\n[20] todavía hay gente de aquella de antaño, ¿no es verdad, Sr.\r\n     Ramos?\r\n\r\n     --Todavía la hay, sí señor--repuso éste.\r\n\r\n     --Yo tengo una fe ciega en el triunfo de la ley de Dios.\r\n     Alguno ha de salir en defensa de ella. Si no son unos,\r\n[25] serán otros. La palma de la victoria, y con ella la gloria\r\n     eterna, alguien se la ha de llevar. Los malvados perecerán,\r\n     si no hoy mañana. Aquél que va contra la ley de Dios\r\n     caerá, no hay remedio. Sea de esta manera, sea de la otra,\r\n     ello es que ha de caer. No le salvan ni sus argucias, ni\r\n[30] sus escondites, ni sus artimañas. La mano de Dios está\r\n     alzada sobre él y le herirá sin falta. Tengámosle compasión\r\n     y deseemos su arrepentimiento... en cuanto a vosotros,\r\n     hijos míos, no esperéis que os diga una palabra sobre el\r\n     paso que seguramente vais a dar. Sé que sois buenos, sé\r\n     que vuestra determinación generosa y el noble fin que os       165\r\n     guía lavan toda mancha pecaminosa por causa del\r\n     derramamiento de sangre que pudierais recibir; sé que Dios os\r\n     bendice, que vuestra victoria, lo mismo que vuestra muerte,\r\n[5]  os sublimarán a los ojos de los hombres y a los de Dios; sé\r\n     que se os deben palmas y alabanzas y toda suerte de\r\n     honores; pero a pesar de esto, hijos míos, mi labio no os\r\n     incitará a la pelea. No lo ha hecho nunca ni lo hará ahora.\r\n     Obrad con arreglo al ímpetu de vuestro noble corazón. Si\r\n[10] él os manda que os estéis en vuestras casas, estáos en ellas;\r\n     si él os manda que salgáis, salid en buen hora. Me resigno\r\n     a ser mártir y a inclinar mi cuello ante el verdugo, si esa\r\n     miserable tropa continúa aquí. Pero si un impulso hidalgo\r\n     y ardiente y pío de los hijos de Orbajosa contribuye a la\r\n[15] grande obra de la extirpación de las desventuras patrias,\r\n     me tendré por el más dichoso de los hombres sólo con ser\r\n     paisano vuestro; y toda mi vida de estudios, de penitencia,\r\n     de resignación, no me parecerá tan meritoria para aspirar\r\n     al cielo, como un día solo de vuestro heroísmo.\r\n\r\n[20] --¡No se puede decir más y mejor!--exclamó doña\r\n     Perfecta arrebatada de entusiasmo.\r\n\r\n     Caballuco se había inclinado hacia adelante en su asiento,\r\n     poniendo los codos sobre las rodillas. Cuando el canónigo\r\n     acabó de hablar, tomóle la mano y se la besó con fervor.\r\n\r\n[25] --Hombre mejor no ha nacido de madre--dijo el tío\r\n     Licurgo enjugando o haciendo que enjugaba una lágrima.\r\n\r\n     --¡Que viva el señor Penitenciario!--gritó Frasquito\r\n     González poniéndose en pie y arrojando hacia el techo su\r\n     gorra.\r\n\r\n[30] --Silencio--dijo doña Perfecta.--Siéntate, Frasquito.\r\n     Tú eres de los de mucho ruido y pocas nueces.\r\n\r\n     --¡Bendito sea Dios, que le dió a usted ese pico de oro!--exclamó\r\n     Cristóbal inflamado de admiración.--¡Qué dos\r\n     personas tengo delante! Mientras vivan las dos, ¿para\r\n     qué se quiere más mundo?... Toda la gente de España            166\r\n     debiera ser así... pero ¡cómo ha de ser así si no hay\r\n     más que pillería! En Madrid, que es la corte de donde\r\n     vienen leyes y mandarines, todo es latrocinio y farsa.\r\n[5]  ¡Pobre religión, cómo la han puesto!... No se ven más\r\n     que pecados.... Señora doña Perfecta, señor D.\r\n     Inocencio, por el alma de mi padre, por el alma de mi abuelo, por\r\n     la salvación de la mía, juro que deseo morir.\r\n\r\n     --¡Morir!\r\n\r\n[10] --Que me maten esos perros tunantes, y digo que me\r\n     maten, porque yo no puedo descuartizarlos a ellos. Soy\r\n     muy chico.\r\n\r\n     --Ramos, eres grande--dijo solemnemente la señora.\r\n\r\n     --¿Grande, grande?... Grandísimo por el corazón;\r\n[15] pero ¿tengo yo plazas fuertes, tengo caballería, tengo\r\n     artillería?\r\n\r\n     --Esa es una cosa, Ramos--dijo doña Perfecta\r\n     sonriendo,--de que yo no me ocuparía. ¿No tiene el enemigo\r\n     lo que a ti te hace falta?\r\n\r\n[20] --Sí.\r\n\r\n     --Pues quítaselo....\r\n\r\n     --Se lo quitaremos, sí, señora. Cuando digo que se lo\r\n     quitaremos....\r\n\r\n[25] --Querido Ramos--exclamó D. Inocencio.--Envidiable\r\n     posición es la de usted.... ¡Destacarse, elevarse sobre\r\n     la vil muchedumbre, ponerse al igual de los mayores héroes\r\n     del mundo... poder decir que la mano de Dios guía su\r\n     mano.... ¡Oh, qué grandeza y honor! Amigo mío, no\r\n     es lisonja. ¡Qué apostura, qué gentileza, qué gallardía!...\r\n[30] No; hombres de tal temple no pueden morir. El Señor\r\n     va con ellos y la bala y hierro enemigos detiénense...\r\n     no se atreven... ¿qué se han de atrever viniendo de\r\n     cañón y de manos de herejes?... Querido Caballuco, al\r\n     ver a usted, al ver su bizarría y caballerosidad, vienen a mi\r\n     memoria, sin poderlo remediar, los versos de aquel romance     167\r\n     de la conquista del imperio de Trapisonda:\r\n\r\n     Llegó el valiente Roldán\r\n     de todas armas armado,\r\n[5]  en el fuerte Briador,\r\n     su poderoso caballo,\r\n     y la fuerte Durlindana\r\n     muy bien ceñida a su lado,\r\n     la lanza como una entena,\r\n[10] el fuerte escudo embrazado....\r\n     Por la visera del yelmo\r\n     fuego venía lanzando;\r\n     retemblando con la lanza\r\n     como un junco muy delgado,\r\n[15] y a toda la hueste junta\r\n     fieramente amenazando.\r\n\r\n     --Muy bien--exclamó Licurgo batiendo palmas.--Y yo\r\n     digo como D. Renialdos:\r\n\r\n     ¡Nadie en don Renialdos toque\r\n[20] si quiere ser bien librado!\r\n     Quien otra cosa quisiere\r\n     él será tan bien pagado,\r\n     que todo el resto del mundo\r\n     no se escape de mi mano\r\n[25] sin quedar pedazos hecho\r\n     o muy bien escarmentado.\r\n\r\n     --Ramos, tú querrás cenar; tú querrás tomar algo, ¿no\r\n     es verdad?--dijo la señora.\r\n\r\n     --Nada, nada--repuso el Centauro,--denme si acaso\r\n[30] un plato de pólvora.\r\n\r\n     Diciendo esto, soltó estrepitosa carcajada, dió varios\r\n     paseos por la habitación, observado atentamente por todos,\r\n     y deteniéndose junto al grupo, fijó los ojos en doña Perfecta,\r\n     y con atronadora voz profirió estas palabras:\r\n\r\n[35] --Digo que no hay más que decir. ¡Viva Orbajosa,\r\n     muera Madrid!\r\n\r\n     Descargó la mano sobre la mesa, con tal fuerza que             168\r\n     retembló el piso de la casa.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué poderoso brío!--dijo D. Inocencio.\r\n\r\n     --Vaya que tienes unos puños....\r\n\r\n[5]  Todos contemplaban la mesa que se había partido en dos\r\n     pedazos.\r\n\r\n     Fijaban luego los ojos en el nunca bastante admirado\r\n     Renialdos o Caballuco. Indudablemente había en su\r\n     semblante hermoso, en sus ojos verdes, animados por extraño\r\n[10] resplandor felino, en su negra cabellera, en su cuerpo\r\n     hercúleo, cierta expresión y aire de grandeza, un resabio o más\r\n     bien recuerdo de las grandes razas que dominaron al mundo.\r\n     Pero su aspecto general era el de una degeneración\r\n     lastimosa, y costaba trabajo encontrar la filiación noble y\r\n[15] heroica en la brutalidad presente. Se parecía a los grandes\r\n     hombres de D. Cayetano, como se parece el mulo al caballo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXIII\r\n\r\n                              =Misterio=\r\n\r\n     Después de lo que hemos referido, duró mucho la\r\n     conferencia; pero omitimos lo restante por no ser indispensable\r\n     para la buena inteligencia de esta relación. Retiráronse al\r\n[20] fin, quedando para lo último, como de costumbre, el Sr. D.\r\n     Inocencio. No habían tenido tiempo aún la señora y el\r\n     canónigo para cambiar dos palabras, cuando entró en el\r\n     comedor una criada de edad y mucha confianza, que era\r\n     el brazo derecho de doña Perfecta, y como ésta la viera\r\n[25] inquieta y turbada, llenóse también de turbación, sospechando\r\n     que algo malo en la casa ocurría.\r\n\r\n     --No encuentro a la señorita por ninguna parte--dijo\r\n     la criada, respondiendo a las preguntas de la señora.\r\n\r\n     --¡Jesús! ¡Rosario!... ¿dónde está mi hija?\r\n\r\n     --¡Válgame la Virgen del Socorro!--gritó el                    169\r\n     Penitenciario, tomando el sombrero y disponiéndose a correr tras\r\n     la señora.\r\n\r\n     --Buscadla bien.... ¿Pero no estaba contigo en su\r\n[5]  cuarto?\r\n\r\n     --Sí, señora--repuso temblando la criada vieja;--pero\r\n     el demonio me tentó y me quedé dormida.\r\n\r\n     --¡Maldito sea tu sueño!... ¡Jesús mío!... ¿qué\r\n     es esto? ¡Rosario, Rosario.... Librada!\r\n\r\n[10] Subieron, bajaron, tornaron a bajar y a subir, llevando\r\n     luz y registrando todas las piezas. Por último oyóse la voz\r\n     del Penitenciario en la escalera, que decía con júbilo:\r\n\r\n     --Aquí está, aquí está. Ya pareció.\r\n\r\n     Un instante después madre e hija se encontraban la una\r\n[15] frente a la otra en la galería.\r\n\r\n     --¿Dónde estabas?--preguntó con severo acento doña\r\n     Perfecta, examinando el rostro de su hija.\r\n\r\n     --En la huerta--repuso la niña más muerta que viva.\r\n\r\n     --¿En la huerta a estas horas? ¡Rosario!...\r\n\r\n[20] --Tenía calor, me asomé a la ventana, se me cayó el\r\n     pañuelo y bajé a buscarlo.\r\n\r\n     --¿Por qué no dijiste a Librada que te lo alcanzase?...\r\n     ¡Librada!... ¿Dónde está esa muchacha? ¿Se ha\r\n     dormido también?\r\n\r\n[25] Librada apareció al fin. Su semblante pálido indicaba\r\n     la consternación y el recelo del delincuente.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué es esto? ¿Dónde estabas?--preguntó con\r\n     terrible enojo la dama.\r\n\r\n     --Pues, señora... bajé a buscar la ropa que está en\r\n[30] el cuarto de la calle... y me quedé dormida.\r\n\r\n     --Todas duermen aquí esta noche. Me parece que alguna\r\n     no dormirá en mi casa mañana. Rosario, puedes retirarte.\r\n\r\n     Comprendiendo que era indispensable proceder con\r\n     prontitud y energía, la señora y el canónigo emprendieron sin\r\n     tardanza sus investigaciones. Preguntas, amenazas, ruegos,     170\r\n     promesas, fueron empleadas con habilidad suma para\r\n     inquirir la verdad de lo acontecido. No resultó ni sombra de\r\n     culpabilidad en la criada anciana; pero Librada confesó de\r\n[5]  plano entre lloros y suspiros todas sus bellaquerías, que\r\n     sintetizaremos del modo siguiente:\r\n\r\n     Poco después de alojarse en la casa, el señor Pinzón\r\n     empezó a hacer cocos a la señorita Rosario. Dió dinero a\r\n     Librada, según ésta dice, para tenerla por mensajera de\r\n[10] recados y amorosas esquelas. La señorita no se mostró\r\n     enojada, sino antes bien gozosa, y pasaron algunos días de\r\n     esta manera. Por último, la sirvienta declara que aquella\r\n     noche Rosario y el Sr. Pinzón habían concertado verse y\r\n     hablarse en la ventana de la habitación de este último, que\r\n[15] da a la huerta. Confiaron su pensamiento a la doncella,\r\n     quien ofreció protegerlo mediante una cantidad que se le\r\n     entregara en el acto. Según lo convenido, el Pinzón debía\r\n     salir de la casa a la hora de costumbre y volver ocultamente\r\n     a las nueve, y entrar en su cuarto, del cual y de la casa\r\n[20] saldría también clandestinamente más tarde, para volver sin\r\n     tapujos a la hora avanzada de costumbre. De este modo\r\n     no podría sospecharse de él. La Librada aguardó al\r\n     Pinzón, el cual entró muy envuelto en su capote sin hablar\r\n     palabra. Metióse en su cuarto a punto que la señorita\r\n[25] bajaba a la huerta. La Librada, mientras duró la entrevista,\r\n     que no presenció, estuvo de centinela en la galería\r\n     para avisar a Pinzón cualquier peligro que ocurriese; y al\r\n     cabo de una hora salió éste como antes, muy bien cubierto\r\n     con su capote y sin hablar una palabra. Concluída la\r\n[30] confesión, D. Inocencio preguntó a la desdichada:\r\n\r\n     --¿Estás segura de que el que entró y salió era el Sr.\r\n     Pinzón?\r\n\r\n     La reo no contestó nada, y sus facciones indicaban gran\r\n     perplejidad.\r\n\r\n     La señora se puso verde de ira.                                171\r\n\r\n     --¿Tú le viste la cara?\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero quién podría ser sino él?--repuso la doncella.--Yo\r\n     tengo la seguridad de que era él. Fué derecho a su\r\n[5]  cuarto... conocía muy bien el camino.\r\n\r\n     --Es raro--dijo el canónigo.--Viviendo en la casa no\r\n     necesitaba emplear tales tapujos.... Podía haber\r\n     pretextado una enfermedad y quedarse.... ¿No es verdad,\r\n     señora?\r\n\r\n[10] --Librada--exclamó ésta con exaltación de ira,--te\r\n     juro por Dios que irás a presidio.\r\n\r\n     Después cruzó las manos, clavándose los dedos de la una\r\n     en la otra con tanta fuerza, que casi se hizo sangre.\r\n\r\n     --Sr. D. Inocencio--exclamó.--Muramos... no hay\r\n[15] más remedio que morir.\r\n\r\n     Después rompió a llorar desconsolada.\r\n\r\n     --Valor, señora mía--dijo el clérigo con acento\r\n     patético.--Mucho valor.... Ahora es preciso tenerlo grande.\r\n     Esto requiere serenidad y gran corazón.\r\n\r\n[20] --El mío es inmenso--dijo entre sollozos la de\r\n     Polentinos.\r\n\r\n     --El mío es pequeñito...--dijo el canónigo;--pero\r\n     allá veremos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXIV\r\n\r\n                             =La confesión=\r\n\r\n     Entre tanto Rosario, con el corazón hecho pedazos, sin\r\n[25] poder llorar, sin poder tener calma ni sosiego, traspasada\r\n     por el frío acero de un dolor inmenso, con la mente pasando\r\n     en veloz carrera del mundo a Dios y de Dios al mundo,\r\n     aturdida y media loca, estaba a altas horas de la noche en\r\n     su cuarto, puesta de hinojos, cruzadas las manos, con los\r\n[30] pies desnudos sobre el suelo, la ardiente sien apoyada en el\r\n     borde del lecho, a obscuras, a solas, en silencio. Cuidaba     172\r\n     de no hacer el menor ruido, para no llamar la atención de\r\n     su mamá, que dormía o aparentaba dormir en la habitación\r\n     inmediata. Elevó al cielo su exaltado pensamiento en esta\r\n[5]  forma:\r\n\r\n     --Señor, Dios mío, ¿por qué antes no sabía mentir y\r\n     ahora sé? ¿Por qué antes no sabía disimular y ahora\r\n     disimulo? ¿Soy una mujer infame?... Esto que siento\r\n     y que a mí me pasa es la caída de las que no vuelven a\r\n[10] levantarse. ¿He dejado de ser buena y honrada?...\r\n     Yo no me conozco. ¿Soy yo misma, o es otra la que está\r\n     en este sitio?... ¡Qué de terribles cosas en tan pocos\r\n     días! ¡Cuántas sensaciones diversas! ¡Mi corazón está\r\n     consumido de tanto sentir!... Señor, Dios mío, ¿oyes\r\n[15] mi voz, o estoy condenada a rezar eternamente sin ser oída?...\r\n     Yo soy buena, nadie me convencerá de que no soy\r\n     buena. Amar, amar muchísimo, ¿es acaso maldad?...\r\n     Pero no... esto no es una ilusión, un engaño. Soy más\r\n     mala que las peores mujeres de la tierra. Dentro de mí\r\n[20] una gran culebra me muerde y me envenena el corazón....\r\n     ¿Qué es esto que siento? ¿Por qué no me matas, Dios\r\n     mío? ¿Por qué no me hundes para siempre en el Infierno?...\r\n     Es espantoso, pero lo confieso, lo confieso a solas a\r\n     Dios, que me oye, y lo confesaré ante el sacerdote.\r\n[25] Aborrezco a mi madre. ¿En qué consiste esto? No puedo\r\n     explicármelo. Él no me ha dicho una palabra en contra de\r\n     mi madre. Yo no sé cómo ha venido esto.... ¡Qué\r\n     mala soy! Los demonios se han apoderado de mí. Señor,\r\n     ven en mi auxilio, porque no puedo con mis propias fuerzas\r\n[30] vencerme.... Un impulso terrible me arroja de esta casa.\r\n     Quiero huir, quiero correr fuera de aquí. Si él no me lleva,\r\n     me iré tras él arrastrándome por los caminos.... ¿Qué\r\n     divina alegría es ésta que dentro de mi pecho se confunde\r\n     con tan amarga pena?... Señor, Dios padre mío, ilumíname.\r\n     Quiero amar tan sólo. Yo no nací para este                     173\r\n     rencor que me está devorando. Yo no nací para disimular,\r\n     ni para mentir, ni para engañar. Mañana saldré a la calle,\r\n     gritaré en medio de ella, y a todo el que pase le diré: _amo,\r\n[5]  aborrezco_.... Mi corazón se desahogará de esta manera....\r\n     ¿Qué dicha sería poder conciliario todo, amar y\r\n     respetar a todo el mundo! La Virgen Santísima me\r\n     favorezca.... Otra vez la idea terrible. No lo quiero pensar,\r\n     y lo pienso. No lo quiero sentir, y lo siento. ¡Ah! no\r\n[10] puedo engañarme sobre este particular. No puedo ni\r\n     destruirlo ni atenuarlo... pero puedo confesarlo y lo\r\n     confieso, diciéndote: ¡Señor, que aborrezco a mi madre!\r\n\r\n     Al fin se aletargó. En su inseguro sueño, la imaginación\r\n     le reproducía todo lo que había hecho aquella noche,\r\n[15] desfigurándolo, sin alterarlo en su esencia. Oía el reloj de la\r\n     catedral dando las nueve; veía con júbilo a la criada\r\n     anciana, durmiendo con beatífico sueño, y salía del cuarto\r\n     muy despacito para no hacer ruido; bajaba la escalera\r\n     suavemente, que no movía un pie hasta no estar segura de\r\n[20] poder evitar el más ligero ruido. Salía a la huerta, dando\r\n     una vuelta por el cuarto de las criadas y la cocina; en la\r\n     huerta deteníase un momento para mirar al cielo, que\r\n     estaba negro y tachonado de estrellas. El viento callaba.\r\n     Ningún viento interrumpía el hondo sosiego de la noche.\r\n[25] Parecía existir en ella una atención fija y silenciosa, propia\r\n     de ojos que miran sin pestañear y oídos que acechan en la\r\n     expectativa de un gran suceso.... La noche observaba.\r\n\r\n     Acercábase después a la puerta vidriera del comedor, y\r\n     miraba con cautela a cierta distancia, temiendo que la vieran\r\n[30] los de dentro. A la luz de la lámpara del comedor veía\r\n     a su madre de espaldas. El Penitenciario estaba a la\r\n     derecha y su perfil se descomponía de un modo extraño; crecíale\r\n     la nariz, asemejándose al pico de un ave inverosímil, y\r\n     toda su figura se tornaba en una recortada sombra, negra y\r\n     espesa, con ángulos aquí y allí, irrisoria, escueta y delgada. 174\r\n     Enfrente estaba Caballuco, más semejante a un dragón que\r\n     a un hombre. Rosario veía sus ojos verdes, como dos\r\n     grandes linternas de convexos cristales. Aquel fulgor y la\r\n[5]  imponente figura del animal le infundían miedo. El tío\r\n     Licurgo y los otros tres se le presentaban como figuritas\r\n     grotescas. Ella había visto, en alguna parte, sin duda en\r\n     los muñecos de barro de las ferias, aquel reír estúpido,\r\n     aquellos semblantes toscos y aquel mirar lelo. El dragón\r\n[10] agitaba sus brazos, que en vez de accionar, daban vueltas\r\n     como aspas de molino, y revolvía los globos verdes, tan\r\n     semejantes a los fanales de una farmacia, de un lado para\r\n     otro. Su mirar cegaba.... La conversación parecía\r\n     interesante. El Penitenciario agitaba las alas. Era una\r\n[15] presumida avecilla que quería volar y no podía. Su pico se\r\n     alargaba y se retorcía. Erizábansele las plumas con\r\n     síntomas de furor, y después, recogiéndose y aplacándose,\r\n     escondía la pelada cabeza bajo el ala. Luego las figurillas de\r\n     barro se agitaban queriendo ser personas, y Frasquito\r\n[20] González se empeñaba en pasar por hombre.\r\n\r\n     Rosario sentía un pavor inexplicable en presencia de\r\n     aquel amistoso concurso. Alejábase de la vidriera y seguía\r\n     adelante paso a paso, mirando a todos lados por ver si era\r\n     observada. Sin ver a nadie, creía que un millón de ojos se\r\n[25] fijaban en ella.... Pero sus temores y su vergüenza\r\n     disipábanse de improviso. En la ventana del cuarto donde\r\n     habitaba el Sr. Pinzón aparecía un hombre azul; brillaban\r\n     en su cuerpo los botones como sartas de lucecillas. Ella se\r\n     acercaba. En el mismo instante sentía que unos brazos\r\n[30] con galones la suspendían como una pluma, metiéndola con\r\n     rápido movimiento dentro de la pieza. Todo cambiaba.\r\n     De súbito sonó un estampido, un golpe seco que estremeció\r\n     la casa en sus cimientos. Ni uno ni otro supieron la causa\r\n     de tal estrépito. Temblaban y callaban.\r\n\r\n     Era el momento en que el dragón había roto la mesa del         175\r\n     comedor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    XXV\r\n\r\n              =Sucesos imprevistos.--Pasajero desconcierto=\r\n\r\n     La escena cambia. Ved una estancia hermosa, clara,\r\n     humilde, alegre, cómoda y de un aseo sorprendente. Fina\r\n[5]  estera de junco cubre el piso, y las blancas paredes se\r\n     adornan con hermosas estampas de santos y algunas esculturas\r\n     de dudoso valor artístico. La antigua caoba de los muebles\r\n     brilla lustrada por los frotamientos del sábado, y el altar,\r\n     donde una pomposa Virgen, de azul y plata vestida, recibe\r\n[10] doméstico culto, se cubre de mil graciosas chucherías, mitad\r\n     sacras, mitad profanas. Hay además cuadritos de\r\n     mostacilla, pilas de agua bendita, una relojera con _Agnus Dei_,\r\n     una rizada palma de Domingo de Ramos y no pocos floreros\r\n     de inodoras flores de trapo. Enorme estante de roble contiene\r\n[15] una rica y escogida biblioteca, y allí está Horacio el\r\n     epicúreo y sibarita junto con el tierno Virgilio, en cuyos\r\n     versos se ve palpitar y derretirse el corazón de la inflamada\r\n     Dido; Ovidio el narigudo, tan sublime como obsceno y\r\n     adulador, junto con Marcial, el tunante lenguaraz y\r\n[20] conceptista; Tibulo el apasionado con Cicerón el grande; el severo\r\n     Tito Livio con el terrible Tácito, verdugo de los Césares;\r\n     Lucrecio el panteísta; Juvenal, que con la pluma desollaba;\r\n     Plauto, el que imaginó las mejores comedias de la\r\n     antigüedad dando vueltas a la rueda de un molino; Séneca el\r\n[25] filósofo, de quien se dijo que el mejor acto de su vida fué la\r\n     muerte; Quintiliano el retórico; Salustio el pícaro, que tan\r\n     bien habla de la virtud; ambos Plinios, Suetonio y Varrón,\r\n     en una palabra, todas las letras latinas, desde que\r\n     balbucieron su primera palabra con Livio Andronico, hasta que\r\n[30] exhalaron su postrer suspiro con Rutilio.\r\n\r\n     Pero haciendo esta inútil, aunque rápida enumeración, no       176\r\n     hemos observado que dos mujeres han entrado en el cuarto.\r\n     Es muy temprano, pero en Orbajosa se madruga mucho.\r\n     Los pajaritos cantan que se las pelan en sus jaulas; tocan\r\n[5]  a misa las campanas de las iglesias, y hacen sonar sus\r\n     alegres esquilas las cabras que van a dejarse ordeñar a las\r\n     puertas de las casas.\r\n\r\n     Las dos señoras que vemos en la habitación descrita\r\n     vienen de oír misa. Visten de negro, y cada cual trae en\r\n[10] la mano derecha su librito de devoción y el rosario envuelto\r\n     en los dedos.\r\n\r\n     --Tu tío no puede tardar ya--dijo una de ellas,--le\r\n     dejamos empezando la misa; pero él despacha pronto, y a\r\n     estas horas estará en la sacristía quitándose la casulla. Yo\r\n[15] me hubiera quedado a oírle la misa, pero hoy es día de\r\n     mucha fatiga para mí.\r\n\r\n     --Yo no he oído hoy más que la del señor magistral--dijo\r\n     la otra;--la del señor magistral que las dice en un\r\n     suspiro, y creo que no me ha sido de provecho, porque\r\n[20] estaba muy preocupada, sin poder apartar el entendimiento\r\n     de estas cosas terribles que nos pasan.\r\n\r\n     --¡Cómo ha de ser!... Es preciso tener paciencia...\r\n     Veremos lo que nos aconseja tu tío.\r\n\r\n     --¡Ay!--exclamó la segunda exhalando un hondo y\r\n[25] patético suspiro.--Yo tengo la sangre abrasada.\r\n\r\n     --Dios nos amparará.\r\n\r\n     --¡Pensar que una persona como usted, una señora como\r\n     usted se ve amenazada por un!... Y él sigue en sus\r\n     trece... Anoche, señora doña Perfecta, conforme usted\r\n[30] me lo mandó, volví a la posada de la viuda del Cuzco, y he\r\n     pedido nuevos informes. El don Pepito y el brigadier\r\n     Batalla están siempre juntos conferenciando... ¡ay Jesús,\r\n     Dios y Señor mío!... conferenciando sobre sus infernales\r\n     planes y despachando botellas de vino. Son dos perdidos,\r\n     dos borrachos. Sin duda discurren alguna maldad muy            177\r\n     grande. Como me intereso tanto por usted, anoche, estando\r\n     yo en la posada, vi salir al D. Pepito y le seguí....\r\n\r\n     --¿Y a dónde fué?\r\n\r\n[5]  --Al Casino, sí, señora, al Casino--repuso la otra turbándose\r\n     ligeramente.--Después volvió a su casa. ¡Ay!\r\n     cuánto me reprendió mi tío por haber estado hasta muy\r\n     tarde ocupada en este espionaje... pero no lo puedo\r\n     remediar... ¡Jesús divino, ampárame! No lo puedo\r\n     remediar, y mirando a una persona como usted en trances 10\r\n     tan peligrosos, me vuelvo loca... Nada, nada, señora,\r\n     estoy viendo que a lo mejor esos tunantes asaltan la casa y\r\n     nos llevan a Rosarito....\r\n\r\n     Doña Perfecta, pues era ella, fijando la vista en el suelo,\r\n[15] meditó largo rato. Estaba pálida y ceñuda. Por fin\r\n     exclamó:\r\n\r\n     --Pues no veo el modo de impedirlo.\r\n\r\n     --Yo sí lo veo--dijo vivamente la otra, que era la\r\n     sobrina del Penitenciario y madre de Jacinto.--Veo un\r\n[20] medio muy sencillo, el que he manifestado a usted y no le\r\n     gusta. ¡Ah! señora mía, usted es demasiado buena. En\r\n     ocasiones como esta conviene ser un poco menos perfecta\r\n     ... dejar a un ladito los escrúpulos. Pues qué, ¿se va a\r\n     ofender Dios por eso?\r\n\r\n[25] --María Remedios--dijo la señora con altanería,--no\r\n     digas desatinos.\r\n\r\n     --¡Desatinos!... Usted, con sus sabidurías, no podrá\r\n     ponerle las peras a cuarto al sobrinejo. ¿Qué cosa más\r\n     sencilla que la que yo propongo? Puesto que ahora no hay\r\n[30] justicia que nos ampare, hagamos nosotros la gran justiciada.\r\n     ¿No hay en casa de usted hombres que sirvan para\r\n     cualquier cosa? Pues llamarles y decirles: \"Mira, Caballuco,\r\n     Pasolargo o quien sea, esta misma noche te tapujas\r\n     bien, de modo que no seas conocido; llevas contigo a un\r\n     amiguito de confianza, y te pones detrás de la esquina de la   178\r\n     calle de Santa Faz. Aguardáis un rato, y cuando D. José\r\n     Rey pase por la calle de la Tripería para ir al Casino, porque\r\n     de seguro irá al Casino, ¿entendéis bien? cuando pase\r\n[5]  le salís al encuentro y le dais un susto\"...\r\n\r\n     --María Remedios, no seas tonta--indicó con magistral\r\n     dignidad la señora.\r\n\r\n     --Nada más que un susto, señora: atienda usted bien\r\n     a lo que digo, un susto. Pues qué, ¿había yo de aconsejar\r\n[10] un crimen?... ¡Jesús, Padre y Redentor mío! Sólo la\r\n     idea me llena de horror, y parece que veo señales de sangre\r\n     y fuego delante de mis ojos. Nada de eso, señora mía...\r\n     Un susto, y nada más que un susto, por lo cual comprenda\r\n     ese bergante que estamos bien defendidas. Él va solo al\r\n[15] Casino, señora, enteramente solo, y allí se junta con sus\r\n     amigotes, los del sable y morrioncete. Figúrese usted que\r\n     recibe el susto y que además le quedan algunos huesos quebrantados,\r\n     sin nada de heridas graves se entiende...\r\n     pues en tal caso, o se acobarda y huye de Orbajosa, o se\r\n[20] tiene que meter en la cama por quince días. Eso sí, hay\r\n     que recomendarles que el susto sea bueno. Nada de matar\r\n     ... cuidadito con eso, pero sentar bien la mano.\r\n\r\n     --María--dijo doña Perfecta con altanería,--tú eres\r\n     incapaz de una idea elevada, de una resolución grande y\r\n[25] salvadora. Eso que me aconsejas es una indignidad\r\n     cobarde.\r\n\r\n     --Bueno, pues me callo... ¡Ay de mí, qué tonta soy!--exclamó\r\n     con humildad la sobrina del Penitenciario.--Me\r\n     guardaré mis tonterías para consolarla a usted después\r\n[30] que haya perdido a su hija.\r\n\r\n     --¡Mi hija!... ¡perder a mi hija!...--exclamó\r\n     la señora con súbito arrebato de ira.--- Sólo oírlo me vuelve\r\n     loca. No, no me la quitarán. Si Rosario no aborrece a ese\r\n     perdido, como yo deseo, le aborrecerá. De algo sirve la\r\n     autoridad de una madre... Le arrancaremos su pasión,           179\r\n     mejor dicho, su capricho, como se arranca una yerba tierna\r\n     que aún no ha tenido tiempo de echar raíces... No,\r\n     esto no puede ser, Remedios. ¡Pase lo que pase, no será!\r\n[5]  No le valen a ese loco ni los medios más infames. Antes\r\n     que verla esposa de mi sobrino, acepto cuanto de malo\r\n     pueda pasarle, incluso la muerte.\r\n\r\n     --Antes muerta, antes enterrada y hecha alimento de\r\n     gusanos--afirmó Remedios cruzando las manos como quien\r\n[10] dice una plegaria,--que verla en poder de... ¡Ay!\r\n     señora, no se ofenda usted si le digo una cosa, y es que\r\n     sería gran debilidad ceder porque Rosarito haya tenido\r\n     algunas entrevistas secretas con ese atrevido. El caso de\r\n     anteanoche, según lo contó mi tío, me parece una treta\r\n[15] infame de D. José para conseguir su objeto por medio del\r\n     escándalo. Muchos hacen esto... ¡Ay, Jesús Divino,\r\n     no sé cómo hay quien le mire la cara a un hombre no siendo\r\n     sacerdote!\r\n\r\n     --Calla, calla--dijo doña Perfecta con vehemencia,--no\r\n[20] me nombres lo de anteanoche. ¡Qué horrible suceso!\r\n     María Remedios... comprendo que la ira puede perder\r\n     un alma para siempre. Yo me abraso... ¡Desdichada\r\n     de mí, ver estas cosas y no ser hombre!... Pero si he\r\n     de decir la verdad sobre lo de anteanoche, aún tengo mis\r\n[25] dudas. Librada jura y perjura que fue Pinzón el que entró.\r\n     ¡Mi hija niega todo, mi hija nunca ha mentido!... Yo\r\n     insisto en mi sospecha. Creo que Pinzón es un bribón\r\n     encubridor; pero nada más....\r\n\r\n     --Volvemos a lo de siempre, a que el autor de todos los\r\n[30] males es el dichoso matemático... ¡Ay! No me engañó\r\n     el corazón cuando le vi por primera vez... Pues, señora\r\n     mía, resígnese usted a presenciar algo más terrible todavía,\r\n     si no se decide a llamar a Caballuco y decirle: \"Caballuco,\r\n     espero que\"...\r\n\r\n     --Vuelta a lo mismo; pero tú eres simple....                   180\r\n\r\n     --¡Oh! Si yo soy muy simplota, lo conozco; pero si no\r\n     alcanzo más, ¿qué puedo hacer? Digo lo que se me ocurre,\r\n     sin sabidurías.\r\n\r\n[5]  --Lo que tú imaginas, esa vulgaridad tonta de la paliza\r\n     y del susto se le ocurre a cualquiera. Tú no tienes dos\r\n     dedos de frente, Remedios; cuando quieres resolver un\r\n     problema grave, sales con tales patochadas. Yo imagino\r\n     un recurso más digno de personas nobles y bien nacidas.\r\n[10] ¡Apalear! ¡qué estupidez! Además, no quiero que mi\r\n     sobrino reciba un rasguño por orden mía: eso de ninguna\r\n     manera. Dios le enviará su castigo por cualquiera de los\r\n     admirables caminos que Él sabe elegir. Sólo nos corresponde\r\n     trabajar porque los designios de Dios no hallen\r\n[15] obstáculo, María Remedios: es preciso en estos asuntos ir\r\n     directamente a las causas de las cosas. Pero tú no entiendes\r\n     de causas... tú no ves más que pequeñeces.\r\n\r\n     --Será así--dijo humildemente la sobrina del cura.--¡Para\r\n     qué me hará Dios tan necia, que nada de esas\r\n[20] sublimidades entiendo!\r\n\r\n     --Es preciso ir al fondo, al fondo, Remedios. ¿Tampoco\r\n     entiendes ahora?\r\n\r\n     --Tampoco.\r\n\r\n     --Mi sobrino, no es mi sobrino, mujer: es la blasfemia,\r\n[25] el sacrilegio, el ateísmo, la demagogia... ¿Sabes lo que\r\n     es la demagogia?\r\n\r\n     --Algo de esa gente que quemó a París con petróleo, y\r\n     los que derriban las iglesias y fusilan las imágenes...\r\n     Hasta ahí vamos bien.\r\n[30] --Pues mi sobrino es todo eso... ¡Ah! ¡si él estuviera\r\n     solo en Orbajosa!... Pero no, hija mía. Mi\r\n     sobrino, por una serie de fatalidades, que son otras tantas\r\n     pruebas de los males pasajeros que a veces permite Dios\r\n     para nuestro castigo, equivale a un ejército, equivale a la\r\n     autoridad del Gobierno, equivale al alcalde, equivale al       181\r\n     juez; mi sobrino no es mi sobrino; es la nación oficial,\r\n     Remedios; es esa segunda nación, compuesta de los perdidos\r\n     que gobiernan en Madrid, y que se ha hecho dueña de\r\n[5]  la fuerza material; de esa nación aparente, porque la real\r\n     es la que calla, paga y sufre; de esa nación ficticia que\r\n     firma al pie de los decretos y pronuncia discursos y hace\r\n     una farsa de gobierno y una farsa de autoridad y una farsa\r\n     de todo. Eso es hoy mi sobrino; es preciso que te acostumbres\r\n[10] a ver lo interno de las cosas. Mi sobrino es el\r\n     Gobierno, el brigadier, el alcalde nuevo, el juez nuevo, porque\r\n     todos le favorecen a causa de la unanimidad de sus\r\n     ideas; porque son uña y carne, lobos de la misma manada...\r\n     Entiéndelo bien; hay que defenderse de todos ellos,\r\n[15] porque todos son uno, y uno es todos; hay que atacarles de\r\n     común, y no con palizas al volver de una esquina, sino como\r\n     atacaban nuestros abuelos a los moros, a los moros, Remedios!...\r\n     Hija mía, comprende bien esto; abre tu entendimiento\r\n     y deja entrar en él una idea que no sea vulgar...\r\n[20] remóntate; piensa en alto, Remedios....\r\n\r\n     La sobrina de D. Inocencio estaba atónita ante tanta\r\n     grandeza. Abrió la boca para decir algo en consonancia\r\n     con tan maravilloso pensamiento; pero sólo exhaló un\r\n     suspiro.\r\n\r\n[25] --Como a los moros--repitió doña Perfecta.--Es cuestión\r\n     de moros y cristianos. ¡Y creías tú que con asustar a\r\n     mi sobrino se concluía todo!... ¡Qué necia eres! ¿No\r\n     ves que le apoyan sus amigos? ¿No ves que estamos a\r\n     merced de esa canalla? ¿No ves que cualquier tenientejo\r\n[30] es capaz de pegar fuego a mi casa si se le antoja?...\r\n     ¿Pero tú no alcanzas esto? ¿No comprendes que es necesario\r\n     ir al fondo? ¿No comprendes la inmensa grandeza,\r\n     la terrible extensión de mi enemigo, que no es un hombre,\r\n     sino una secta?... ¿No comprendes que mi sobrino, tal\r\n     como está hoy enfrente de mí, no es una calamidad sino una     182\r\n     plaga?... Contra ella, querida Remedios, tendremos\r\n     aquí un batallón de Dios que aniquile la infernal milicia de\r\n     Madrid. Te digo que esto va a ser grande y glorioso....\r\n\r\n[5]  --Si al fin fuera....\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero tú lo dudas? Hoy hemos de ver aquí cosas\r\n     terribles...--dijo con gran impaciencia la señora.--Hoy,\r\n     hoy. ¿Qué hora es? Las siete. ¡Tan tarde y no ocurre\r\n     nada!...\r\n\r\n[10] --Quizás sepa algo mi tío, que está aquí ya. Le siento\r\n     subir la escalera.\r\n\r\n     --Gracias a Dios...--dijo doña Perfecta levantándose\r\n     para salir al encuentro del Penitenciario.--Él nos dirá algo\r\n     bueno.\r\n\r\n[15] Don Inocencio entró apresurado. Su demudado rostro\r\n     indicaba que aquella alma, consagrada a la piedad y a los\r\n     estudios latinos, no estaba tan tranquila como de ordinario.\r\n\r\n     --Malas noticias--dijo poniendo sobre una silla el\r\n     sombrero y desatando los cordones del manteo.\r\n\r\n[20] Doña Perfecta palideció.\r\n\r\n     --Están prendiendo gente--añadid D. Inocencio, bajando\r\n     la voz, cual si debajo de cada silla estuviera un\r\n     soldado. Sospechan, sin duda, que los de aquí no les aguantarían\r\n     sus pesadas bromas y han ido de casa en casa\r\n[25] echando mano a todos los que tenían fama de valientes....\r\n\r\n     La señora se arrojó en un sillón y apretó fuertemente los\r\n     dedos contra la madera de los brazos del mueble.\r\n\r\n     --Falta que se hayan dejado prender--- indicó Remedios.\r\n\r\n[30] --Muchos de ellos... pero muchos--dijo D. Inocencio\r\n     con ademanes encomiados, dirigiéndose a la señora,--han\r\n     tenido tiempo de huir y se han ido con armas y caballos\r\n     a Villahorrenda.\r\n\r\n     --¿Y Ramos?\r\n\r\n     --En la catedral me dijeron que es el que buscan con           183\r\n     más empeño... ¡Oh, Dios mío! prender así a unos infelices\r\n     que nada han hecho todavía... Vamos, no sé cómo\r\n     los buenos españoles tienen paciencia. Señora mía doña\r\n[5]  Perfecta, refiriendo esto de las prisiones, me he olvidado\r\n     decir a usted que debe marcharse a su casa al momento.\r\n\r\n     --Sí, al momento... ¿Registrarán mi casa esos\r\n     bandidos?\r\n\r\n     --Quizás. Señora, estamos en un día nefasto--dijo D.\r\n[10] Inocencio con solemne y conmovido acento.--¡Dios se\r\n     apiade de nosotros!\r\n\r\n     --En mi casa tengo media docena de hombres muy bien\r\n     armados--repuso la dama, vivamente alterada. ¡Qué\r\n     iniquidad! ¿Serán capaces de querer llevárselos también?...\r\n\r\n[15] --De seguro el Sr. Pinzón no se habrá descuidado en\r\n     denunciarlos. Señora, repito que estamos en un día nefasto.\r\n     Pero Dios amparará la inocencia.\r\n\r\n     --Me voy. No deje usted de pasar por allá.\r\n\r\n     --Señora, en cuanto despache la clase... y me figuro\r\n[20] que con la alarma que hay en el pueblo, todos los chicos\r\n     harán novillos hoy; pero haya o no clase, iré después por\r\n     allá... No quiero que salga usted sola, señora. Andan\r\n     por las calles esos zánganos de soldados con unos humos...\r\n     ¡Jacinto, Jacinto!\r\n\r\n[25] --No es preciso. Me marcharé sola.\r\n\r\n     --Que vaya Jacinto--dijo la madre de éste.--Ya debe\r\n     estar levantado.\r\n\r\n     Sintiéronse los precipitados pasos del doctorcillo que\r\n     bajaba a toda prisa la escalera del piso alto. Venía con el\r\n[30] rostro encendido, fatigado el aliento.\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué hay?--le preguntó su tío.\r\n\r\n     --En casa de las Troyas--dijo el jovenzuelo,--en casa\r\n     de esas... pues....\r\n\r\n     --Acaba de una vez.\r\n\r\n     --Está Caballuco.                                              184\r\n\r\n     --¿Allá arriba?... ¿En casa de las Troyas?\r\n\r\n     --Sí, señor... Me ha hablado desde el terrado, y me\r\n     ha dicho que está temiendo le vayan a coger allí.\r\n\r\n[5]  --¡Oh, qué bestia!... Ese majadero se va a dejar\r\n     prender--exclamó doña Perfecta, hiriendo el suelo con el\r\n     inquieto pie.\r\n\r\n     --Quiere bajar aquí y que le escondamos en casa.\r\n\r\n     --¿Aquí?\r\n\r\n[10] Canónigo y sobrina se miraron.\r\n\r\n     --¡Que baje!--dijo doña Perfecta con vehemente\r\n     frase.\r\n\r\n     --¿Aquí?--repitió D. Inocencio poniendo cara de mal\r\n     humor.\r\n\r\n[15] --Aquí--contestó la señora.--No conozco casa donde\r\n     pueda estar más seguro.\r\n\r\n     --Puede saltar fácilmente por la ventana de mi cuarto--dijo\r\n     Jacinto.\r\n\r\n     --Pues si es indispensable....\r\n\r\n[20] --María Remedios--dijo la señora.--Si nos cogen a\r\n     este hombre, todo se ha perdido.\r\n\r\n     --Tonta y simple soy--repuso la sobrina del canónigo,\r\n     poniéndose la mano en el pecho y ahogando el suspiro que\r\n     sin duda iba a salir al público;--pero no le cogerán.\r\n\r\n[25] La señora salió rápidamente, y poco después el Centauro\r\n     se arrellanaba en la butaca donde el Sr. D. Inocencio solía\r\n     sentarse a escribir sus sermones.\r\n\r\n     No sabemos cómo llegó a oídos del brigadier Batalla;\r\n     pero es indudable que este diligente militar tenía noticia de\r\n[30] que los orbajosenses habían variado de intenciones, y en la\r\n     mañana de aquel día dispuso la prisión de los que en nuestro\r\n     rico lenguaje insurreccional solemos llamar _caracterizados_.\r\n     Salvóse por milagro el gran Caballuco, refugiándose en\r\n     casa de las Troyas; pero no creyéndose allí seguro, bajó,\r\n     como se ha visto, a la santa y no sospechosa mansión del       185\r\n     buen canónigo.\r\n\r\n     Por la noche la tropa, establecida en diversos puntos del\r\n     pueblo, ejercía la mayor vigilancia con los que entraban y\r\n[5]  salían; pero Ramos logró evadirse burlando o quizás sin\r\n     burlar las precauciones militares. Esto acabó de encender\r\n     los ánimos, y multitud de gente se conjuraba en los caseríos\r\n     cercanos a Villahorrenda, juntándose de noche para dispersarse\r\n     de día y preparar así el arduo negocio de su levantamiento.\r\n[10] Ramos recorrió las cercanías allegando gente y\r\n     armas, y como las columnas volantes andaban tras los Aceros\r\n     en tierra de Villajuán de Nahara, nuestro héroe caballeresco\r\n     adelantó mucho en poco tiempo.\r\n\r\n     Por las noches arriesgábase con audacia suma a entrar en\r\n[15] Orbajosa; valiéndose de medios de astucia o tal vez de\r\n     sobornos. Su popularidad y la protección que recibía dentro\r\n     del pueblo servíanle hasta cierto punto de salvaguardia,\r\n     y no será aventurado decir que la tropa no desplegaba ante\r\n     aquel osado campeón el mismo rigor que ante los hombres\r\n[20] insignificantes de la localidad. En España, y principalmente\r\n     en tiempo de guerras, que son siempre aquí desmoralizadoras,\r\n     suelen verse esas condescendencias infames con los\r\n     grandes, mientras se persigue sin piedad a los pequeñuelos.\r\n     Valido, pues, de su audacia, del soborno, o no sabemos de\r\n[25] qué, Caballuco entraba en Orbajosa, reclutaba más gente,\r\n     reunía armas y acopiaba dinero. Para mayor seguridad de\r\n     su persona, o para cubrir el expediente, no ponía los pies en\r\n     su casa, apenas entraba en la de doña Perfecta para tratar\r\n     de asuntos importantes, y solía cenar en casa de este o del\r\n[30] otro amigo, prefiriendo siempre el respetado domicilio de\r\n     algún sacerdote, y principalmente el de don Inocencio,\r\n     donde recibiera asilo en la mañana funesta de las prisiones.\r\n\r\n     En tanto Batalla había telegrafiado al Gobierno diciéndole\r\n     que, descubierta una conspiración facciosa, estaban\r\n     presos sus autores, y los pocos que lograron escapar andaban   186\r\n     dispersos y fugitivos, _activamente perseguidos por nuestras\r\n     columnas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXVI\r\n\r\n                             María Remedios\r\n\r\n     Nada más entretenido que buscar el origen de los sucesos\r\n[5]  interesantes que nos asombran o perturban, ni nada más\r\n     grato que encontrarlo. Cuando vemos arrebatadas pasiones\r\n     en lucha encubierta o manifiesta, llevados del natural impulso\r\n     inductivo que acompaña siempre a la observación humana,\r\n     logramos descubrir la oculta fuente de donde aquel revuelto\r\n[10] río ha traído sus aguas, experimentamos sensación muy\r\n     parecida al gozo de los geógrafos y buscadores de tierras.\r\n\r\n     Este gozo nos lo ha concedido Dios ahora, porque explorando\r\n     los escondrijos de los corazones que laten en esta\r\n     historia, hemos descubierto un hecho que seguramente es el\r\n[15] engendrador de los hechos más importantes que hemos\r\n     narrado; una pasión que es la primera gota de agua de esta\r\n     alborotada corriente, cuya marcha estamos observando.\r\n\r\n     Continuemos, pues, la narración. Para ello dejemos a la\r\n     señora de Polentinos, sin cuidarnos de lo que pudo ocurrirle\r\n[20] en la mañana de su diálogo con María Remedios. Penetra\r\n     llena de zozobra en su vivienda, donde se ve obligada a\r\n     soportar las excusas y cortesanías del Sr. Pinzón, quien\r\n     asegura que mientras él existiera, la casa de la señora no\r\n     sería registrada. Le responde doña Perfecta de un modo\r\n[25] altanero, sin dignarse fijar en él los ojos, por cuya razón él\r\n     pide urbanamente explicaciones de tal desvío, a lo cual ella\r\n     contesta rogando al Sr, Pinzón abandone su casa, sin perjuicio\r\n     de dar oportunamente cuenta de su alevosa conducta\r\n     dentro de ella. Llega D. Cayetano y se cruzan palabras de\r\n[30] caballero a caballero; pero como ahora nos interesa más\r\n     otro asunto, dejemos a los Polentinos y al teniente coronel    187\r\n     que se las compongan como puedan, y pasemos a examinar\r\n     aquello de los manantiales arriba mencionados.\r\n\r\n     Fijemos la atención en María Remedios, mujer estimable,\r\n[5]  a la cual es urgente consagrar algunas líneas. Era una\r\n     señora, una verdadera señora, pues a pesar de su origen\r\n     humildísimo, las virtudes de su tío carnal el Sr. D.\r\n     Inocencio, también de bajo origen, mas sublimado por\r\n     el Sacramento así como por su saber y respetabilidad,\r\n[10] habían derramado extraordinario esplendor sobre toda la\r\n     familia.\r\n\r\n     El amor de Remedios a Jacinto era una de las más vehementes\r\n     pasiones que en el corazón maternal pueden caber.\r\n     Le amaba con delirio; ponía el bienestar de su hijo sobre\r\n[15] todas las cosas humanas; creíale el más perfecto tipo de la\r\n     belleza y del talento, creados por Dios, y diera por verle\r\n     feliz y grande y poderoso, todos los días de su vida y aun\r\n     parte de la eterna gloria. El sentimiento materno es el\r\n     único que, por lo muy santo y noble, admite la exageración;\r\n[20] el único que no se bastardea con el delirio. Sin embargo,\r\n     ocurre un fenómeno singular que no deja de ser común en\r\n     la vida, y es que si esta exaltación del afecto materno no\r\n     coincide con la absoluta pureza del corazón y con la honradez\r\n     perfecta, suele extraviarse y convertirse en frenesí\r\n[25] lamentable, que puede contribuir como otra cualquiera\r\n     pasión desbordada, a grandes faltas y catástrofes.\r\n\r\n     En Orbajosa, María Remedios pasaba por un modelo de\r\n     virtud y de sobrinas: quizás lo era en efecto. Servía cariñosamente\r\n     a cuantos la necesitaban; jamás dió motivo a\r\n[30] hablillas y murmuraciones de mal género; jamás se mezcló\r\n     en intrigas. Era piadosa, no sin dejarse llevar a extremos\r\n     de mojigatería chocante; practicaba la caridad; gobernaba\r\n     la casa de su tío con habilidad suprema; era bien recibida,\r\n     admirada y obsequiada en todas partes, a pesar del sofoco\r\n     casi intolerable que producía su continuo afán de suspirar y   188\r\n     expresarse siempre en tono quejumbroso.\r\n\r\n     Pero en casa de doña Perfecta, aquella excelente señora\r\n     sufría una especie de _capitis diminutio_. En tiempos remotos\r\n[5]  y muy aciagos para la familia del buen Penitenciario, María\r\n     Remedios (si es verdad, ¿por qué no se ha de decir?) había\r\n     sido lavandera en la casa de Polentinos. Y no se crea por\r\n     esto que doña Perfecta la miraba con altanería: nada de\r\n     eso. Tratábala sin orgullo: sentía hacia ella un cariño\r\n[10] verdaderamente fraternal; comían juntas; rezaban juntas;\r\n     referíanse sus cuitas; ayudábanse mutuamente en sus caridades\r\n     y en sus devociones, así como en los negocios de la\r\n     casa... ¡pero fuerza es decirlo! siempre había algo,\r\n     siempre había una raya invisible, pero infranqueable, entre\r\n[15] la señora improvisada y la señora antigua. Doña Perfecta\r\n     tuteaba a María, y ésta jamás pudo prescindir de ciertas\r\n     fórmulas. Sentíase tan pequeña la sobrina de D. Inocencio\r\n     en presencia de la amiga de éste, que su humildad nativa\r\n     tomaba un tinte extraño de tristeza. Veía que el buen\r\n[20] canónigo era en la casa una especie de consejero áulico inamovible;\r\n     veía a su idolatrado Jacintillo en familiaridad casi\r\n     amorosa con la señorita, y sin embargo, la pobre madre y\r\n     sobrina frecuentaba la casa lo menos posible. Es preciso\r\n     indicar que María Remedios se deseñoraba bastante (pase\r\n[25] la palabra) en casa de doña Perfecta, y esto le era desagradable,\r\n     porque también en aquel espíritu suspirón había,\r\n     como en todo lo que vive, un poco de orgullo... ¡Ver a\r\n     su hijo casado con Rosarito; verle rico y poderoso; verle\r\n     emparentado con doña Perfecta, con la señora!... ¡Ay!\r\n[30] esto era para María Remedios la tierra y el cielo, esta vida\r\n     y la otra, el presente y el más allá, la totalidad suprema de\r\n     la existencia. Hacía años que su pensamiento y su corazón\r\n     se llenaban de aquella dulce luz de esperanza. Por esto\r\n     era buena y mala, por esto era religiosa y humilde o terrible\r\n     y osada, por esto era todo cuanto hay que ser, porque sin      189\r\n     tal idea, María, que era la encarnación de su proyecto, no\r\n     existiría.\r\n\r\n     En su físico, María Remedios no podía ser más insignificante.\r\n[5]  Distinguíase por una lozanía sorprendente que aminoraba\r\n     en apariencia el valor numérico de sus años, y vestía\r\n     siempre de luto, a pesar de que su viudez era ya cuenta\r\n     muy larga.\r\n\r\n     Habían pasado cinco días desde la entrada de Caballuco\r\n[10] en casa del señor Penitenciario. Principiaba la noche.\r\n     Remedios entró con la lámpara encendida en el cuarto de\r\n     su tío, y después de dejarla sobre la mesa, se sentó frente\r\n     al anciano, que desde media tarde permanecía inmóvil y\r\n     meditabundo en su sillón, cual si le hubieran clavado en él.\r\n[15] Sus dedos sostenían la barba, arrugando la morena piel no\r\n     rapada en tres días.\r\n\r\n     --¿Caballuco dijo que vendría a cenar aquí esta noche?--preguntó\r\n     a su sobrina.\r\n\r\n     --Sí, señor, vendrá. En estas casas respetables es donde\r\n[20] el pobrecito está más seguro.\r\n\r\n     --Pues yo no las tengo todas conmigo a pesar de la respetabilidad\r\n     de mi casa--repuso el Penitenciario.--¡Cómo\r\n     se expone el valiente Ramos!... Y me han dicho que\r\n     en Villahorrenda y su campiña hay mucha gente... qué\r\n[25] sé yo cuánta gente... ¿Qué has oído tú?\r\n\r\n     --Que la tropa está haciendo unas barbaridades....\r\n\r\n     --¡Es milagro que esos caribes no hayan registrado mi\r\n     casa! Te juro que si veo entrar uno de los de pantalón\r\n     encarnado, me caigo sin habla.\r\n\r\n[30] --¡Buenos, buenos estamos!--dijo Remedios, echando\r\n     en un suspiro la mitad de su alma.--No puedo apartar de\r\n     mi mente la tribulación en que se encuentra la señora doña\r\n     Perfecta... ¡Ay, tío! debe usted ir allá.\r\n\r\n     --¿Allá esta noche?... Andan las tropas por las\r\n     calles. Figúrate que a un soldadote se le antoja... La         190\r\n     señora está bien defendida. El otro día registraron la casa\r\n     y se llevaron los seis hombres armados que allí tenía; pero\r\n     después se los han devuelto. Nosotros no tenemos quien\r\n[5]  nos defienda en caso de un atropello.\r\n\r\n     --Yo he mandado a Jacinto a casa de la señora para que\r\n     la acompañe un ratito. Si Caballuco viene le diremos que\r\n     pase también por allá... Nadie me quita de la cabeza\r\n     que alguna gran fechoría preparan esos pillos contra nuestra\r\n[10] amiga. ¡Pobre señora, pobre Rosarito!... Cuando uno\r\n     piensa que esto podía haberse evitado con lo que propuse a\r\n     doña Perfecta hace dos días....\r\n\r\n     --Querida sobrina--dijo flemáticamente el Penitenciario,--hemos\r\n     hecho todo cuanto en lo humano cabía para\r\n[15] realizar nuestro santo propósito... Ya no se puede más.\r\n     Hemos fracasado, Remedios. Convéncete de ello, y no\r\n     seas terca: Rosarito no puede ser la mujer de nuestro idolatrado\r\n     Jacintillo. Tu sueño dorado, tu ideal dichoso que\r\n     un tiempo nos pareció realizable, y al cual consagré yo las\r\n[20] fuerzas todas de mi entendimiento, como buen tío, se ha\r\n     trocado ya en una quimera, se ha disipado como el humo.\r\n     Entorpecimientos graves, la maldad de un hombre, la pasión\r\n     indudable de la niña y otras cosas que callo, han vuelto las\r\n     cosas del revés. Ibamos venciendo, y de pronto somos\r\n[25] vencidos. ¡Ay, sobrina mía! Convéncete de una cosa.\r\n     Hoy por hoy, Jacinto merece mucho más que esa niña loca.\r\n\r\n     --Caprichos y terquedades--repuso María con displicencia\r\n     bastante irrespetuosa.--Vaya con lo que sale usted\r\n     ahora, tío. Pues las grandes cabezas se están luciendo...\r\n[30] Doña Perfecta con sus sublimidades y usted con sus cavilaciones,\r\n     sirven para cualquier cosa. Es lástima que Dios me\r\n     haya hecho a mí tan tonta, y dádome este entendimiento de\r\n     ladrillo y argamasa, como dice la señora, porque si así no\r\n     fuera, yo resolvería la cuestión.\r\n\r\n     --¿Tú?                                                         191\r\n\r\n     --Si ella y usted me hubieran dejado, resuelta estaría ya.\r\n\r\n     --¿Con los palos?\r\n\r\n     --No asustarse, ni abrir tanto los ojos, porque no se trata\r\n[5]  de matar a nadie... ¡vaya!\r\n\r\n     --Eso de los palos--dijo el canónigo sonriendo,--es\r\n     como el rascar... ya sabes.\r\n\r\n     --¡Bah!... diga usted también que soy cruel y sanguinaria...\r\n     me falta valor para matar un gusanito; bien lo\r\n[10] sabe usted... Ya se comprende que no había yo de\r\n     querer la muerte de un hombre.\r\n\r\n     --En resumen, hija mía, por más vueltas que le des, el\r\n     Sr. D. Pepe Rey se lleva la niña. Ya no es posible evitarlo.\r\n     Él está dispuesto a emplear todos los medios, incluso la\r\n[15] deshonra. Si la Rosarito... cómo nos engañaba con\r\n     aquella carita circunspecta y aquellos ojos celestiales, ¿eh?\r\n     ... si la Rosarito, digo, no le quisiera... vamos\r\n     ... todo podría arreglarse; pero ¡ay! le ama como ama el\r\n     pecador al demonio; está abrasada en criminal fuego; cayó,\r\n[20] sobrina mía, cayó en la infernal trampa libidinosa. Seamos\r\n     honrados y justos; volvamos la vista de la innoble pareja,\r\n     y no pensemos más en el uno ni en la otra.\r\n\r\n     --Usted no entiende de mujeres, tío--dijo Remedios\r\n     con lisonjera hipocresía;--usted es un santo varón; usted\r\n[25] no comprende que lo de Rosarito no es más que un caprichillo\r\n     de esos que pasan, de esos que se curan con un par\r\n     de refregones en los morros o media docena de azotes.\r\n\r\n     --Sobrina--dijo D. Inocencio grave y sentenciosamente,--cuando\r\n     ha habido cosas mayores, los caprichillos no se\r\n[30] llaman caprichillos, sino de otra manera.\r\n\r\n     --Tío, usted no sabe lo que dice--repuso la sobrina,\r\n     cuyo rostro se inflamó súbitamente.--Pues qué, ¿será usted\r\n     capaz de suponer en Rosarito?... ¡qué atrocidad! Yo\r\n     la defiendo, sí, la defiendo... Es pura como un ángel....\r\n     Vamos, tío, con esas cosas se me suben los colores a la cara   192\r\n     y me pone usted soberbia.\r\n\r\n     Al decir esto, el semblante del buen clérigo se cubría de\r\n     una sombra de tristeza, que en apariencia le envejecía diez\r\n[5]  años.\r\n\r\n     --Querida Remedios--añadió.--Hemos hecho todo lo\r\n     humanamente posible y todo lo que en conciencia podía y\r\n     debía hacerse. Nada más natural que nuestro deseo de ver\r\n     a Jacintillo emparentado con esa gran familia, la primera\r\n[10] de Orbajosa; nada más natural que nuestro deseo de verle\r\n     dueño de las siete casas del pueblo, de la dehesa de Mundogrande,\r\n     de las tres huertas del cortijo de Arriba, de la Encomienda,\r\n     y demás predios urbanos y rústicos que posee esa\r\n     niña. Tu hijo vale mucho, bien lo saben todos. Rosarito\r\n[15] gustaba de él y él de Rosarito. Parecía cosa hecha. La\r\n     misma señora, sin entusiasmarse mucho, a causa sin duda\r\n     de nuestro origen, parecía bien dispuesta a ello, a causa de\r\n     lo mucho que me estima y venera, como a confesor y amigo...\r\n     Pero de repente se presenta ese malhadado joven.\r\n[20] La señora me dice que tiene un compromiso con su hermano\r\n     y que no se atreve a rechazar la proposición por éste hecha.\r\n     ¡Conflicto grave! Pero ¿qué hago yo en vista de esto?\r\n     ¡Ay! no lo sabes tú bien. Yo te soy franco: si hubiera\r\n     visto en el Sr. de Rey un hombre de buenos principios,\r\n[25] capaz de hacer feliz a Rosario, no habría intervenido en el\r\n     asunto; pero el tal joven me pareció una calamidad, y como\r\n     director espiritual de la casa debí tomar cartas en el asunto\r\n     y las tomé. Ya sabes que le puse la proa, como vulgarmente\r\n     se dice. Desenmascaré sus vicios; descubrí su\r\n[30] ateísmo; puse a la vista de todo el mundo la podredumbre de\r\n     aquel corazón materializado, y la señora se convenció de\r\n     que entregaba a su hija al vicio... ¡Ay! qué afanes\r\n     pasé. La señora vacilaba; yo fortalecía su ánimo indeciso;\r\n     aconsejábale los medios lícitos que debía emplear contra el\r\n     sobrinejo para alejarle sin escándalo; sugeríale ideas\r\n     ingeniosas, y como ella me mostraba a menudo su pura conciencia 193\r\n     llena de alarmas, yo la tranquilizaba demarcando hasta\r\n     qué punto eran lícitas las batallas que librábamos contra\r\n[5]  aquel fiero enemigo. Jamás aconsejé medios violentos\r\n     ni sanguinarios, ni atrocidades de mal género, sino sutiles\r\n     trazas que no contenían pecado. Estoy tranquilo, querida\r\n     sobrina. Pero bien sabes tú que he luchado, que he trabajado\r\n     como un negro. ¡Ay! cuando volvía a casa por las\r\n[10] noches y decía: \"Mariquilla, vamos bien, vamos muy bien,\"\r\n     tú te volvías loca de contento y me besabas las manos cien\r\n     veces, y decías que era yo el hombre mejor del mundo.\r\n     ¿Por qué te enfureces ahora, desfigurando tu noble carácter\r\n     y pacífica condición? ¿Por qué me riñes? ¿Por qué dices\r\n[15] que estás soberbia y me llamas en buenas palabras Juan\r\n     Lanas?\r\n\r\n     --Porque usted--dijo la mujer sin cejar en su irritación,--se\r\n     ha acobardado de repente.\r\n\r\n     --Es que todo se nos vuelve en contra, mujer. El maldito\r\n[20] ingeniero, favorecido por la tropa, está resuelto a todo.\r\n     La chiquilla le ama, la chiquilla... no quiero decir más.\r\n     No puede ser, te digo que no puede ser.\r\n\r\n     --¡La tropa! Pero usted cree como doña Perfecta que\r\n     va a haber una guerra, y que para echar de aquí a D. Pepe,\r\n[25] se necesita que media nación se levante contra la otra media...\r\n     La señora se ha vuelto loca, y usted allá se le va.\r\n\r\n     --Creo lo mismo que ella. Dada la íntima conexión de\r\n     Rey con los militares, la cuestión personal se agranda...\r\n     Pero ¡ay! sobrina mía, si hace dos días tuve esperanza de\r\n[30] que nuestros valientes echaran de aquí a puntapiés a la\r\n     tropa, desde que he visto el giro que han tomado las cosas;\r\n     desde que he visto que la mayor parte son sorprendidos\r\n     antes de pelear, y que Caballuco se esconde y que esto se\r\n     lo lleva la trampa, desconfío de todo. Los buenos principios\r\n     no tienen aún bastante fuerza material para hacer pedazos      194\r\n     a los ministros y emisarios del error... ¡Ay! sobrina\r\n     mía, resignación, resignación.\r\n\r\n     Apropiándose entonces D. Inocencio el medio de expresión\r\n[5]  que caracterizaba a su sobrina, suspiró dos o tres veces\r\n     ruidosamente. María, contra todo lo que podía esperarse,\r\n     guardó profundo silencio. No había en ella, al menos aparentemente,\r\n     ni cólera, ni tampoco el sentimentalismo superficial\r\n     de su ordinaria vida; no había sino una aflicción profunda\r\n[10] y modesta. Poco después de que el buen tío concluyera\r\n     su perorata, dos lágrimas rodaron por las sonrosadas\r\n     mejillas de la sobrina: no tardaron en oírse algunos sollozos\r\n     mal comprimidos, y poco a poco, así como van creciendo en\r\n     ruido y forma la hinchazón y tumulto de un mar que empieza\r\n[15] a alborotarse, así fué encrespándose aquel oleaje del\r\n     dolor de María Remedios, hasta que rompió en deshecho\r\n     llanto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXVII\r\n\r\n                       El tormento de un canónigo\r\n\r\n     --¡Resignación, resignación!--volvió a decir D. Inocencio.\r\n\r\n[20] --¡Resignación, resignación!--repitió ella, enjugando\r\n     sus lágrimas.--Puesto que mi querido hijo ha de ser siempre\r\n     un pelagatos, séalo en buen hora. Los pleitos escasean;\r\n     bien pronto llegará el día en que lo mismo será la abogacía\r\n     que nada. ¿De qué vale el talento? ¿De qué valen\r\n[25] tanto estudio y romperse la cabeza? ¡Ay! Somos pobres.\r\n     Llegará un día, Sr. D. Inocencio, en que mi pobre hijo no\r\n     tendrá una almohada sobre que reclinar la cabeza.\r\n\r\n     --¡Mujer!\r\n\r\n     --¡Hombre!... Y si no, dígame: ¿qué herencia piensa\r\n[30] usted dejarle cuando cierre el ojo? Cuatro cuartos, seis\r\n     libruchos, miseria y nada más... Van a venir unos tiempos...   195\r\n     ¡qué tiempos, señor tío!... ¡Mi pobre hijo, que\r\n     se está poniendo muy delicado de salud, no podrá trabajar\r\n     ... ya se le marea la cabeza desde que lee un libro; ya le\r\n[5]  dan bascas y jaqueca siempre que trabaja de noche!...\r\n     tendrá que mendigar un destinejo; tendré yo que ponerme\r\n     a la costura, y quién sabe, quién sabe... como no tengamos\r\n     que pedir limosna.\r\n\r\n     --¡Mujer!\r\n\r\n[10] --Bien sé lo que digo... Buenos tiempos van a venir--añadió\r\n     la excelente mujer, forzando más el sonsonete\r\n     llorón con que hablaba.--¡Dios mío! ¿Qué va a ser de\r\n     nosotros? ¡Ah! Sólo el corazón de una madre siente estas\r\n     cosas... Sólo las madres son capaces de sufrir tantas\r\n[15] penas por el bienestar de un hijo. Usted, ¿cómo lo ha de\r\n     comprender? No: una cosa es tener hijos y pasar amarguras\r\n     por ellos, y otra cosa es cantar el _gori gori_ en la catedral\r\n     y enseñar latín en el Instituto... Vea usted de qué\r\n     le vale a mi hijo el ser sobrino de usted y el haber sacado\r\n[20] tantas notas de sobresaliente, y ser el primor y la gala de\r\n     Orbajosa... Se morirá de hambre, porque ya sabemos\r\n     lo que da la abogacía, o tendrá que pedir a los diputados un\r\n     destino en la Habana, donde le matará la fiebre amarilla....\r\n\r\n     --¡Pero mujer!\r\n\r\n[25] --No, si no me apuro, si ya callo, si no le molesto a usted\r\n     más. Soy muy impertinente, muy llorona, muy suspirona,\r\n     y no se me puede aguantar, porque soy madre cariñosa y\r\n     miro por el bien de mi amado hijo. Yo me moriré, sí\r\n     señor, me moriré en silencio y ahogaré mi dolor, me beberé\r\n[30] mis lágrimas para no mortificar al señor canónigo... Pero\r\n     mi idolatrado hijo me comprenderá, y no se tapará los oídos\r\n     como usted hace en este momento... ¡ay de mí! El\r\n     pobre Jacinto sabe que me dejaría matar por él, y que le\r\n     proporcionaría la felicidad a costa de mi vida. ¡Pobrecito\r\n     niño de mis entrañas! Tener tanto mérito, y vivir condenado    196\r\n     a un pasar mediano, a una condición humilde, porque\r\n     no, señor tío, no se ensoberbezca usted... Por más que\r\n     echemos humos, siempre será usted el hijo del tío Tinieblas,\r\n[5]  el sacristán de San Bernardo... y yo no seré nunca más\r\n     que la hija de Ildefonso Tinieblas, su hermano de usted, el\r\n     que vendía pucheros, y mi hijo será el nieto de los Tinieblas\r\n     ... que tenemos un tenebrario en nuestra casta, y\r\n     nunca saldremos de la obscuridad, ni poseeremos un pedazo\r\n[10] de terruño donde decir: \"esto es mío,\" ni trasquilaremos\r\n     una oveja propia, ni ordeñaremos jamás una cabra propia, ni\r\n     meteré mis manos hasta el codo en un saco de trigo trillado\r\n     y aventado en nuestras eras... todo esto a causa de su poco\r\n     ánimo de usted, de su bobería y corazón amerengado....\r\n\r\n[15] --¡Pero... pero mujer!\r\n\r\n     Subía más de tono el canónigo cada vez que repetía esta\r\n     frase, y puestas las manos en los oídos, sacudía a un lado y\r\n     otro la cabeza con doloroso ademán de desesperación. La\r\n     chillona cantinela de María Remedios era cada vez más\r\n[20] aguda, y penetraba en el cerebro del infeliz y ya aturdido\r\n     clérigo como una saeta. Pero de repente transformóse el\r\n     rostro de aquella mujer, mudáronse los plañideros sollozos\r\n     en una voz bronca y dura, palideció su rostro, temblaron sus\r\n     labios, cerráronse sus puños, cayéronle sobre la frente algunas\r\n[25] guedejas del desordenado cabello, secáronse por completo\r\n     sus ojos al calor de la ira que bramaba en su pecho,\r\n     levantóse del asiento, y no como una mujer, sino como una\r\n     harpía, gritó de este modo:\r\n\r\n     --¡Yo me voy de aquí, yo me voy con mi hijo!...\r\n[30] Nos iremos a Madrid; no quiero que mi hijo se pudra en\r\n     este poblachón. Estoy cansada de ver que mi hijo, al amparo\r\n     de la sotana, no es ni será nunca nada. ¿Lo oye usted,\r\n     señor tío? ¡Mi hijo y yo nos vamos! Usted no nos verá\r\n     nunca más; pero nunca más.\r\n\r\n     Don Inocencio había cruzado las manos y recibía los furibundos 197\r\n     rayos de su sobrina con la consternación de un reo\r\n     a quien la presencia del verdugo quita ya toda esperanza.\r\n\r\n     --Por Dios, Remedios--murmuró con voz dolorida,--por\r\n[5]  la Virgen Santísima....\r\n\r\n     Aquellas crisis y horribles erupciones del manso carácter\r\n     de la sobrina eran tan fuertes como raras, y se pasaban a\r\n     veces cinco o seis años sin que D. Inocencio viera a Remedios\r\n     convertirse en una furia.\r\n\r\n[10] --¡Soy madre!... ¡Soy madre!... y puesto que\r\n     nadie mira por mi hijo, miraré yo, yo misma--rugió la\r\n     improvisada leona.\r\n\r\n     --Por María Santísima, mujer, no te arrebates... Mira\r\n     que estás pecando... Recemos un Padre nuestro y un\r\n[15] Ave María, y verás cómo se te pasa eso.\r\n\r\n     Diciendo esto, el Penitenciario temblaba y sudaba. ¡Pobre\r\n     pollo en las garras del buitre! La mujer transformada\r\n     acabó de estrujarle con estas palabras:\r\n\r\n     --Usted no sirve para nada; usted es un mandria...\r\n[20] Mi hijo y yo nos marcharemos de aquí para siempre, para\r\n     siempre. Yo le conseguiré una posición a mi hijo, yo le\r\n     buscaré una buena conveniencia, ¿entiende usted? Así\r\n     como estoy dispuesta a barrer las calles con la lengua, si de\r\n     este modo fuera preciso ganarle la comida, así también\r\n[25] revolveré la tierra para buscar una posición a mi hijo, para\r\n     que suba, y sea rico, y personaje, y caballero, y propietario,\r\n     y señor, y grande, y todo cuanto hay que ser, todo, todo.\r\n\r\n     --¡Dios me favorezca!--exclamó D. Inocencio dejándose\r\n     caer en el sillón e inclinando la cabeza sobre el pecho.\r\n\r\n[30] Hubo una pausa, durante la cual se oía el agitado resuello\r\n     de la mujer furiosa.\r\n\r\n     --Mujer--dijo al fin D. Inocencio,--me has quitado\r\n     diez años de vida; me has abrasado la sangre; me has\r\n     vuelto loco... ¡Dios me dé la serenidad que para\r\n     aguantarte necesito! Señor, paciencia, paciencia es lo que     198\r\n     quiero; y tú, sobrina, hazme el favor de llorar y lagrimear y\r\n     estar suspirando a moco y baba diez años, pues tu maldita\r\n     maña de los pucheros, que tanto me enfada, es preferible a\r\n[5]  esas locas iras. Si no supiera que en el fondo eres buena...\r\n     Vaya, que para haber confesado y recibido a Dios\r\n     esta mañana, te estás portando.\r\n\r\n     --Sí, pero es por usted, por usted.\r\n\r\n     --¿Porque en el asunto de Rosario y de Jacinto te digo\r\n[10] \"resignación\"?\r\n\r\n     --Porque cuando todo marcha bien, usted se vuelve atrás\r\n     y permite que el Sr. Rey se apodere de Rosarito.\r\n\r\n     --¿Y cómo lo voy a evitar? Bien dice la señora que\r\n     tienes entendimiento de ladrillo. ¿Quieres que salga por\r\n[15] ahí con una espada, y en un quítame allá esas pajas haga\r\n     picadillo a toda la tropa, y después me encare con Rey y le\r\n     diga: \"o usted me deja en paz a la niña o le corto el\r\n     pescuezo\"?\r\n\r\n     --No, pero cuando aconsejé a la señora que diera un\r\n[20] susto a su sobrino, usted se ha opuesto, en vez de aconsejarle\r\n     lo mismo que yo.\r\n\r\n     --Tú estás loca con eso del susto.\r\n\r\n     --Porque \"muerto el perro se acabó la rabia.\"\r\n\r\n     --Yo no puedo aconsejar eso que llamas susto y que\r\n[25] puede ser una cosa tremenda.\r\n\r\n     --Sí, porque soy una matona, ¿no es verdad, tío?\r\n\r\n     --Ya sabes que los juegos de manos son juegos de villanos.\r\n     Además, ¿crees que ese hombre se dejará asustar?\r\n     ¿Y sus amigos?\r\n\r\n[30] --De noche sale solo.\r\n\r\n     --¿Tú qué sabes?\r\n\r\n     --Lo sé todo, y no da un paso sin que yo me entere,\r\n     ¿estamos? La viuda del Cuzco me tiene al tanto de\r\n     todo.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, no me vuelvas loco. ¿Y quién le va a dar ese          199\r\n     susto?... Sepámoslo.\r\n\r\n     --Caballuco.\r\n\r\n     --¿De modo qué él está dispuesto?...\r\n\r\n[5]  --No, pero lo estará si usted se lo manda.\r\n\r\n     --Vamos, mujer, déjame en paz. Yo no puedo mandar\r\n     tal atrocidad. ¡Un susto! ¿Y qué es eso? ¿Tú le has\r\n     hablado ya?\r\n\r\n     --Sí, señor; pero no me ha hecho caso, mejor dicho, se\r\n[10] niega a ello. En Orbajosa no hay más que dos personas que\r\n     puedan decidirle con una simple orden: usted o doña\r\n     Perfecta.\r\n\r\n     --Pues que se lo mande la señora si quiere. Jamás\r\n     aconsejaré que se empleen medios violentos y brutales.\r\n[15] ¿Querrás creer que cuando Caballuco y algunos de los suyos\r\n     estaban tratando de levantarse en armas, no pudieron sacarme\r\n     una sola palabra incitándoles a derramar sangre?\r\n     No, eso no... Si doña Perfecta quiere hacerlo....\r\n\r\n     --Tampoco quiere. Esta tarde he estado hablando con\r\n[20] ella dos horas, y dice que predicará la guerra favoreciéndola\r\n     por todos los medios; pero que no mandará a un hombre\r\n     que hiera por la espalda a otro. Tendría razón en oponerse\r\n     si se tratara de cosa mayor... pero no quiero que haya\r\n     heridas; yo no quiero más que un susto.\r\n\r\n[25] --Pues si doña Perfecta no quiere ordenar que se dé\r\n     sustos al ingeniero, yo tampoco, ¿entiendes? Antes que\r\n     nada es mi conciencia.\r\n\r\n     --Bueno--repuso la sobrina.--Dígale usted a Caballuco\r\n     que me acompañe esta noche... no le diga usted\r\n[30] más que eso.\r\n\r\n     --¿Vas a salir tarde?\r\n\r\n     --Voy a salir, sí señor. Pues qué, ¿no salí también anoche?\r\n\r\n     --¿Anoche? No lo supe; si lo hubiera sabido, me\r\n     hubiera enfadado, sí señora.\r\n\r\n     --No le diga usted a Caballuco sino lo siguiente: \"Querido     200\r\n     Ramos, le estimaré mucho que acompañe a mi sobrina\r\n     a cierta diligencia que tiene que hacer esta noche, y que la\r\n     defienda si acaso se ve en algún peligro.\"\r\n\r\n[5]  --Eso sí lo puedo hacer. Que te acompañe... que te\r\n     defienda. ¡Ah, picarona! tú quieres engañarme, haciéndome\r\n     cómplice de alguna majadería.\r\n\r\n     --Ya... ¿qué cree usted?--dijo irónicamente María\r\n     Remedios.--Entre Ramos y yo vamos a degollar mucha\r\n[10] gente esta noche.\r\n\r\n     --No bromees. Te repito que no le aconsejaré a Ramos\r\n     nada que tenga visos de maldad. Me parece que está\r\n     ahí....\r\n\r\n     Oyóse ruido en la puerta de la calle. Luego sonó la voz\r\n[15] de Caballuco que hablaba con el criado, y poco después el\r\n     héroe de Orbajosa penetró en la estancia.\r\n\r\n     --Noticias, vengan noticias, Sr. Ramos--dijo el clérigo.--Vaya,\r\n     que si no nos da usted alguna esperanza en cambio\r\n     de la cena y de la hospitalidad... ¿Qué hay en\r\n[20] Villahorrenda?\r\n\r\n     --Alguna cosa--repuso el valentón sentándose con muestras\r\n     de cansancio.--Pronto verá usted si servimos para algo.\r\n\r\n     Como todas las personas que tienen importancia o quieren\r\n     dársela, Caballuco mostraba gran reserva.\r\n\r\n[25] --Esta noche, amigo mío, se llevará usted, si quiere, el\r\n     dinero que me han dado para....\r\n\r\n     --Buena falta hace... Como lo huelan los de tropa\r\n     no me dejarán pasar--dijo Ramos riendo brutalmente.\r\n\r\n     --Calle usted, hombre... Ya sabemos que usted pasa\r\n[30] siempre que se le antoja. Pues no faltaba más. Los militares\r\n     son gente de manga ancha... y si se pusieran pesados,\r\n     con un par de duros, ¿eh? Vamos, veo que no viene\r\n     usted mal armado... No le falta más que un cañón de\r\n     a ocho. Pistolitas, ¿eh?... También navaja.\r\n\r\n     --Por lo que pueda suceder--dijo Caballuco, sacando            201\r\n     el arma del cinto y mostrando su horrible hoja.\r\n\r\n     --¡Por Dios y la Virgen!--exclamó María Remedios,\r\n     cerrando los ojos y apartando con miedo el rostro.--Guarde\r\n[5]  usted ese chisme. Me horrorizo sólo de verlo.\r\n\r\n     --Si ustedes no lo llevan a mal--dijo Ramos cerrando\r\n     el arma,--cenaremos.\r\n\r\n     María Remedios dispuso todo con precipitación, para que\r\n     el héroe no se impacientase.\r\n\r\n[10] --Oiga usted una cosa, Sr. Ramos--dijo D. Inocencio\r\n     a su huésped cuando se pusieron a cenar.--¿Tiene usted\r\n     muchas ocupaciones esta noche?\r\n\r\n     --Algo hay que hacer--repuso el bravo.--Ésta es la\r\n     última noche que vengo a Orbajosa, la ultima. Tengo que\r\n[15] recoger algunos muchachos que quedan por aquí, y vamos a\r\n     ver cómo sacamos el salitre y el azufre que está en casa de\r\n     Cirujeda.\r\n\r\n     --Lo decía--añadió bondadosamente el cura, llenando\r\n     el plato de su amigo,--porque mi sobrina quiere que la\r\n[20] acompañe usted un momento. Tiene que hacer no sé qué\r\n     diligencia y es algo tarde para ir sola.\r\n\r\n     --¿Va a casa de doña Perfecta?--preguntó Ramos.--Allí\r\n     he estado hace un momento; no quise detenerme.\r\n\r\n     --¿Cómo está la señora?\r\n\r\n[25] --Miedosilla. Esta noche he sacado los seis mozos que\r\n     tenía en la casa.\r\n\r\n     --Hombre: ¿cree usted que no hacen falta allí?--dijo\r\n     Remedios con zozobra.\r\n\r\n     --Más falta hacen en Villahorrenda. Dentro de las\r\n[30] casas se pudre la gente valerosa, ¿no es verdad, señor\r\n     canónigo?\r\n\r\n     --Señor Ramos, aquella casa no debe estar nunca sola--dijo\r\n     el Penitenciario.\r\n\r\n     --Con los criados basta y sobra. ¿Pero usted cree, Sr.\r\n\r\n     D. Inocencio, que el brigadier se ocupa de asaltar casas       202\r\n     ajenas?\r\n\r\n     --Sí; pero bien sabe usted que ese ingeniero de tres mil\r\n     docenas de demonios....\r\n\r\n[5]  --Para eso... en la casa no faltan escobas--manifestó\r\n     Cristóbal jovialmente.--Si al fin y al cabo no tendrán\r\n     más remedio que casarlos... Después de lo que ha\r\n     pasado....\r\n\r\n     --Señor Ramos--dijo Remedios súbitamente enojada,--se\r\n[10] me figura que no entiende usted gran cosa en esto de\r\n     casar a la gente.\r\n\r\n     --Dígolo porque esta noche, hace un momento, vi que la\r\n     señora y la niña estaban haciendo al modo de una reconciliación.\r\n     Doña Perfecta besuqueaba a Rosarito, y todo era\r\n[15] echarse palabrillas tiernas y mimos.\r\n\r\n     --¡Reconciliación! usted con eso de los armamentos ha\r\n     perdido la chaveta... Pero en fin, ¿me acompaña usted\r\n     o no?\r\n\r\n     --No es a la casa de la señora donde quiere ir--dijo el\r\n[20] clérigo,--sino a la posada de la viuda de Cuzco. Estaba\r\n     diciendo que no se atreve a ir sola, porque teme ser\r\n     insultada....\r\n\r\n     --¿Por quién?\r\n\r\n     --Bien se comprende. Por ese ingeniero de tres mil o\r\n[25] cuatro mil docenas de demonios. Anoche mi sobrina le vió\r\n     allí y le dijo cuatro frescas, por cuya razón no las tiene todas\r\n     consigo esta noche. El mocito es vengativo y procaz.\r\n\r\n     --No sé si podré ir...--indicó Caballuco,--como\r\n     ando ahora escondido, no puedo desafiar al D. José Poquita\r\n[30] Cosa. Si yo no estuviera como estoy, con media cara tapada\r\n     y la otra medio descubierta, ya le había roto treinta veces el\r\n     espinazo. ¿Pero qué sucede si caigo sobre él? Que me\r\n     descubro; caen sobre mí los soldados, y adiós Caballuco.\r\n     En cuanto a darle un golpe a traición, es cosa que no sé\r\n     hacer, ni está en mi natural, ni la señora lo consiente        203\r\n     tampoco. Para solfas con alevosía no sirve Cristóbal\r\n     Ramos.\r\n\r\n     --Pero hombre, ¿estamos locos?... ¿qué está usted\r\n[5]  hablando?--dijo el Penitenciario con innegables muestras\r\n     de asombro.--Ni por pienso le aconsejo yo a usted que\r\n     maltrate a ese caballero. Antes me dejaré cortar la lengua\r\n     que aconsejar una bellaquería. Los malos caerán, es verdad;\r\n     pero Dios es quien debe fijar el momento, no yo. No\r\n[10] se trata tampoco de dar palos. Antes recibiré yo diez docenas\r\n     de ellos que recomendar a un cristiano la administración\r\n     de tales medicinas. Sólo digo a usted una cosa\r\n     (añadió, mirando al bravo por encima de los espejuelos), y\r\n     es, que como mi sobrina va allá, como es probable, muy\r\n[15] probable, ¿no es eso, Remedios?... que tenga que decir\r\n     algunas palabrejas a ese hombre, recomiendo a usted que\r\n     no la desampare en caso de que se vea insultada....\r\n\r\n     --Esta noche tengo que hacer--repuso lacónica y secamente\r\n     Caballuco.\r\n\r\n[20] --Ya lo oyes, Remedios. Deja tu diligencia para\r\n     mañana.\r\n\r\n     --Eso sí que no puede ser. Iré sola.\r\n\r\n     --No, no irás, sobrina mía. Tengamos la fiesta en paz.\r\n     El Sr. Ramos tiene que hacer y no puede acompañarte.\r\n[25] Figúrate que eres injuriada por ese hombre grosero....\r\n\r\n     --¡Insultada... insultada una señora por ese!...--exclamó\r\n     Caballuco.--Vamos, no puede ser.\r\n\r\n     --Si usted no tuviera ocupaciones... ¡bah, bah! ya\r\n     estaría yo tranquilo.\r\n\r\n[30] --Ocupaciones tengo--dijo el Centauro levantándose\r\n     de la mesa;--pero si es empeño de usted....\r\n\r\n     Hubo una pausa. El Penitenciario había cerrado los\r\n     ojos y meditaba.\r\n\r\n     --Empeño mío es, Sr. Ramos--dijo al fin.\r\n\r\n     --Pues no hay más que hablar. Iremos, señora doña María.       204\r\n\r\n     --Ahora, querida sobrina--- dijo D. Inocencio entre serio\r\n     y jovial,--puesto que hemos concluído de cenar, tráeme la\r\n     jofaina.\r\n\r\n[5]  Dirigió a su sobrina una mirada penetrante, y acompañándolas\r\n     de la acción correspondiente, profirió estas palabras:\r\n\r\n     --Yo me lavo las manos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXVIII\r\n\r\n     De Pepe Rey a D. Juan Rey\r\n\r\n     _Orbajosa 12 de Abril_.\r\n\r\n     \"Querido padre: perdóneme usted si por primera vez le\r\n     desobedezco no saliendo de aquí, ni renunciando a mi propósito.\r\n[10] El consejo y ruego de usted son propios de un\r\n     padre bondadoso y honrado: mi terquedad es propia de un\r\n     hijo insensato; pero en mí pasa una cosa singular; terquedad\r\n     y honor se han juntado y confundido de tal modo, que\r\n     la idea de disuadirme y ceder me causa vergüenza. He\r\n[15] cambiado mucho. Yo no conocía estos furores que me\r\n     abrasan. Antes me reía de toda obra violenta, de las exageraciones\r\n     de los hombres impetuosos, como de las brutalidades\r\n     de los malvados. Ya nada de esto me asombra, porque\r\n     en mí mismo encuentro a todas horas cierta capacidad\r\n[20] terrible para la perversidad. A usted puedo hablarle como\r\n     se habla a solas con Dios y con la conciencia; a usted\r\n     puedo decirle que soy un miserable, porque es un miserable\r\n     quien carece de aquella poderosa fuerza moral contra sí\r\n     mismo, que castiga las pasiones y somete la vida al duro\r\n[25] régimen de la conciencia. He carecido de la entereza cristiana\r\n     que contiene el espíritu del hombre ofendido en un\r\n     hermoso estado de elevación sobre las ofensas que recibe y\r\n     los enemigos que se las hacen; he tenido la debilidad de\r\n     abandonarme a una ira loca, poniéndome al bajo nivel de        205\r\n     mis detractores, devolviéndoles golpes iguales a los suyos, y\r\n     tratando de confundirles por medios aprendidos en su propia\r\n     indigna escuela. ¡Cuánto siento que no estuviera usted\r\n[5]  a mi lado para apartarme de este camino! Ya es tarde.\r\n     Las pasiones no tienen espera. Son impacientes, y piden\r\n     su presa a gritos y con la convulsión de una espantosa sed\r\n     moral. He sucumbido. No puedo olvidar lo que tantas\r\n     veces me ha dicho usted, y es que la ira puede llamarse la\r\n[10] peor de las pasiones, porque transformando de improviso\r\n     nuestro carácter, engendra todas las demás maldades, y a\r\n     todas les presta su infernal llamarada.\r\n\r\n     \"Pero no ha sido sola la ira, sino un fuerte sentimiento\r\n     expansivo lo que me ha traído a tal estado, el amor profundo\r\n[15] y entrañable que profeso a mi prima, única circunstancia\r\n     que me absuelve. Y si el amor no, la compasión me habría\r\n     impulsado a desafiar el furor y las intrigas de su terrible\r\n     hermana de usted, porque la pobre Rosario, colocada entre\r\n     su afecto irresistible y su madre, es hoy uno de los seres\r\n[20] más desgraciados que existen sobre la tierra. El amor que\r\n     me tiene y que corresponde al mío, ¿no me da derecho a\r\n     abrir, como pueda, las puertas de su casa y sacarla de allí,\r\n     empleando la ley hasta donde la ley alcance, y usando la\r\n     fuerza desde el punto en que la ley me desampare? Creo\r\n[25] que la rigurosísima escrupulosidad moral de usted no dará\r\n     una respuesta afirmativa a esta proposición; pero yo he\r\n     dejado de ser aquel carácter metódico y puro, conformado\r\n     en su conciencia con la exactitud de un tratado. Yo no soy\r\n     aquel a quien una educación casi perfecta dió pasmosa\r\n[30] en sus sentimientos; ahora soy un hombre como\r\n     irregularidadotro cualquiera; de un solo paso he entrado en el\r\n     terreno común de lo injusto y de lo malo. Prepárese usted a oír\r\n     cualquier barbaridad, que será obra mía. Yo cuidaré de\r\n     notificar a usted las que vaya cometiendo.\r\n\r\n     \"Pero ni la confesión de mis culpas me quitará la              206\r\n     responsabilidad de los sucesos graves que han ocurrido y\r\n     ocurrirán; ni ésta, por mucho que argumente, recaerá toda entera\r\n     sobre su hermana de usted. La responsabilidad de doña\r\n[5]  Perfecta es inmensa, seguramente. ¿Cuál será la extensión\r\n     de la mía? ¡Ah, querido padre! No crea usted nada de\r\n     lo que oiga respecto a mí, y aténgase tan sólo a lo que yo le\r\n     revele. Si le dicen que he cometido una villanía deliberada,\r\n     responda que es mentira. Difícil, muy difícil me es juzgarme\r\n[10] a mí mismo en el estado de turbación en que me hallo; pero\r\n     me atrevo a asegurar que no he producido deliberadamente el\r\n     escándalo. Bien sabe usted a dónde puede llegar la pasión\r\n     favorecida en su horrible crecimiento invasor por las\r\n     circunstancias.\"\r\n\r\n[15] \"Lo que más amarga mi vida es haber empleado la ficción,\r\n     el engaño y bajos disimulos. ¡Yo que era la verdad\r\n     misma! He perdido mi propia hechura.... Pero, ¿es\r\n     esto la perversidad mayor en que puede incurrir el alma?\r\n     ¿Empiezo ahora o acabo? Nada sé. Si Rosario con su\r\n[20] mano celeste no me saca de este infierno de mi conciencia,\r\n     deseo que venga usted a sacarme. Mi prima es un ángel, y\r\n     padeciendo por mí, me ha enseñado muchas cosas que antes\r\n     no sabía.\"\r\n\r\n     \"No extrañe usted la incoherencia de lo que escribo.\r\n[25] Diversos sentimientos me inflaman. Me asaltan a ratos\r\n     ideas dignas verdaderamente de mi alma inmortal; pero a\r\n     ratos caigo también en un desfallecimiento lamentable, y\r\n     pienso en los hombres débiles y menguados, cuya bajeza me\r\n     ha pintado usted con vivos colores para que los aborrezca.\r\n[30] Tal como hoy me hallo, estoy dispuesto al mal y al bien.\r\n     Dios tenga piedad de mí. Ya sé lo que es la oración, una\r\n     suplica grave y reflexiva, tan personal que no se aviene con\r\n     fórmulas aprendidas de memoria; una expansión del alma\r\n     que se atreve a extenderse hasta buscar su origen; lo contrario\r\n     del remordimiento, que es una contradicción de la              207\r\n     misma alma, envolviéndose y ocultándose con la ridicula\r\n     pretensión de que nadie la vea. Usted me ha enseñado\r\n     muy buenas cosas; pero ahora estoy en prácticas, como\r\n[5]  decimos los ingenieros; hago estudios sobre el terreno, y\r\n     con esto mis conocimientos se ensanchan y fijan.... Se\r\n     me está figurando ahora que no soy tan malo como yo\r\n     mismo creo. ¿Será así?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Concluyo esta carta a toda prisa. Tengo que enviarla\r\n[10] con unos soldados que van hacia la estación de Villahorrenda,\r\n     porque no hay que fiarse del correo de esta gente.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _14 de Abril_.\r\n\r\n     \"Le divertiría a usted, querido padre, si pudiera hacerle\r\n     comprender cómo piensa la gente de este poblachón. Ya\r\n     sabrá usted que casi todo este país se ha levantado en\r\n[15] armas. Era cosa prevista, y los políticos se equivocan si\r\n     creen que es cosa de un par de días. La hostilidad contra\r\n     nosotros y contra el Gobierno la tienen los orbajosenses en\r\n     su espíritu, formando parte de él como la fe religiosa.\r\n     Concretándome a la cuestión particular con mi tía, diré a usted\r\n[20] una cosa singular, y es que la pobre señora, que tiene el\r\n     feudalismo en la médula de los huesos, ha imaginado que\r\n     yo voy a atacar su casa para robarle su hija, como los\r\n     señores de la Edad Media atacaban un castillo enemigo para\r\n     consumar cualquier desafuero. No se ría usted, que es\r\n[25] verdad: tales son las ideas de esta gente. Excuso decir a\r\n     usted que me tiene por un monstruo, por una especie de rey\r\n     moro herejote; y los militares con quienes he hecho amistad\r\n     aquí no merecen mejor concepto. En casa de doña Perfecta\r\n     es cosa corriente que la tropa y yo formamos una\r\n[30] coalición diabólica y antireligiosa para quitarle a Orbajosa\r\n     sus tesoros, su fe y sus muchachas. Me consta que su\r\n     hermana de usted cree a pie juntillas que yo le voy a tomar    208\r\n     por asalto la casa, y no es dudoso que detrás de la puerta\r\n     habrá alguna barricada.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Pero no puede ser de otra manera. Aquí tienen las\r\n[5]  ideas más anticuadas acerca de la sociedad, de la religión,\r\n     del Estado, de la propiedad. La exaltación religiosa que\r\n     les impulsa a emplear la fuerza contra el Gobierno, por\r\n     defender una fe que nadie ha atacado y que ellos no tienen\r\n     tampoco, despierta en su ánimo resabios feudales, y como\r\n[10] resolverían sus cuestiones por la fuerza bruta y a sangre y\r\n     fuego, degollando a todo el que no piense como ellos, creen\r\n     que no hay en el mundo quien emplee otros medios.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Lejos de ser mi intento hacer quijotadas en la casa de\r\n     esa señora, he procurado evitarle algunas molestias, de que\r\n[15] no se libraron los demás vecinos. Por mi amistad con el\r\n     brigadier no les han obligado a presentar, como se mandó,\r\n     una lista de todos los hombres de su servidumbre que se\r\n     han marchado con la facción; y si se le registró la casa,\r\n     me consta que fue por fórmula; y si le desarmaron los seis\r\n[20] hombres que allí tenía, después ha puesto otros tantos y\r\n     nada se le ha hecho. Vea usted a lo que está reducida mi\r\n     hostilidad a la señora.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Verdad es que yo tengo el apoyo de los jefes militares;\r\n     pero lo utilizo tan sólo para no ser insultado o maltratado\r\n[25] por esta gente implacable. Mis probabilidades de éxito\r\n     consisten en que las autoridades recientemente puestas por\r\n     el jefe militar son todas amigas. Tomo de ellas mi fuerza\r\n     moral y les intimido. No sé si me veré en el caso de cometer\r\n     alguna acción violenta; pero no se asuste usted, que el\r\n[30] asalto y toma de la casa es una pura y loca preocupación\r\n     feudal de su hermana de usted. La casualidad me ha\r\n     puesto en situación ventajosa. La ira, la pasión que arde\r\n     en mí, me impulsarán a aprovecharla. No sé hasta dónde\r\n     iré.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _17 de Abril._                                                 209\r\n\r\n     \"La carta de usted me ha dado un gran consuelo. Sí;\r\n     puedo conseguir mi objeto, usando tan sólo los recursos de\r\n     la ley, eficaces completamente para esto. He consultado a\r\n     las autoridades de aquí, y todas me confirman en lo que\r\n[5]  usted me indica. Estoy contento. Ya que he inculcado en\r\n     el ánimo de mi prima la idea de la desobediencia, que sea\r\n     al menos al amparo de las leyes sociales. Haré lo que\r\n     usted me manda, es decir, renunciaré a la colaboración un\r\n     poco fea de Pinzón; destruiré la solidaridad aterradora que\r\n[10] establecí con los militares; dejaré de envanecerme con el\r\n     poder de ellos; pondré fin a las aventuras, y en el momento\r\n     oportuno procederé con calma, prudencia y toda la benignidad\r\n     posible. Mejor es así. Mi coalición, mitad seria,\r\n     mitad burlesca, con el ejército, ha tenido por objeto ponerme\r\n[15] al amparo de las brutalidades de los orbajosenses y de los\r\n     criados y deudos de mi tía. Por lo demás, siempre he\r\n     rechazado la idea de lo que llamamos _la intervención armada_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"El amigo que me favorecía ha tenido que salir de la\r\n     casa; pero no estoy en completa incomunicación con mi\r\n[20] prima.

Esta tarde estuvo hablando con él\r\n     Estebanillo, el chico de la huerta.\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero usted busca a D. José?--preguntó el Centauro\r\n     de muy mal humor.--¿Qué nos importa? El noviazgo con\r\n[25] doña Rosario paró donde debía parar, y ahora no hay más\r\n     remedio sino que la señora tiene que casarlos. Ésa es mi\r\n     opinión.\r\n\r\n     --Usted es un animal--dijo Remedios con enfado.                211\r\n\r\n     --Señora, yo me voy.\r\n\r\n     --Pues qué, hombre grosero, ¿me va usted a dejar sola\r\n     en medio de la calle?\r\n\r\n[5]  --Si usted no se va pronto a su casa, sí señora.\r\n\r\n     --Eso es... me deja usted sola, expuesta a ser insultada....\r\n     Oiga usted, Sr. Ramos. Don José saldrá ahora\r\n     del Casino, como de costumbre. Quiero saber si entra en\r\n     su casa o sigue adelante. Es un capricho, nada más que\r\n[10] un capricho.\r\n\r\n     --Yo lo que sé es que tengo que hacer, y van a dar las\r\n     doce.\r\n\r\n     --Silencio--dijo Remedios,--ocultémonos detrás de la\r\n     esquina.... Un hombre viene por la calle de la Tripería\r\n[15] Alta. Es él.\r\n\r\n     --Don José.... Le conozco en el modo de andar.\r\n     Se ocultaron y el hombre pasó.\r\n\r\n     --Sigámosle--dijo María Remedios con zozobra.--\r\n     Sigámosle a corta distancia, Ramos.\r\n\r\n[20] --Señora....\r\n\r\n     --Nada más sino hasta ver si entra en su casa.\r\n\r\n     --Un minutillo nada más, doña Remedios. Después me\r\n     marcharé.\r\n\r\n     Anduvieron como treinta pasos, a regular distancia del\r\n[25] hombre que observaban. La sobrina del Penitenciario se\r\n     detuvo al fin, y pronunció estas palabras:\r\n\r\n     --No entra en su casa.\r\n\r\n     --Irá a casa del brigadier.\r\n\r\n     --El brigadier vive hacia arriba, y D. Pepe va hacia\r\n[30] abajo, hacia casa de la señora.\r\n\r\n     --¡De la señora!--exclamó Caballuco andando a prisa.\r\n     Pero se engañaban; el espiado pasó por delante de la\r\n     casa de Polentinos, y siguió adelante.\r\n\r\n     --¿Ve usted cómo no?\r\n\r\n     --Señor Ramos, sigámosle--dijo Remedios, oprimiendo            212\r\n     convulsamente la mano del Centauro.--Tengo una corazonada.\r\n\r\n     --Pronto hemos de saberlo, porque el pueblo se acaba.\r\n\r\n[5]  --No vayamos tan de prisa... puede vernos.... Lo\r\n     que yo pensé, Sr. Ramos; va a entrar por la puerta condenada\r\n     de la huerta.\r\n\r\n     --¡Señora, usted se ha vuelto loca!\r\n\r\n     --Adelante, y lo veremos.\r\n\r\n[10] La noche era obscura y no pudieron los observadores precisar\r\n     dónde había entrado el Sr. de Rey; pero cierto ruido\r\n     de visagras mohosas que oyeron, y la circunstancia de no\r\n     encontrar al joven en todo lo largo de la tapia, les convencieron\r\n     de que se había metido dentro de la huerta. Caballuco\r\n[15] miró a su interlocutora con estupor. Parecía lelo.\r\n\r\n     --¿En qué piensa usted?... ¿Todavía duda?\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué debo hacer?--preguntó el bravo lleno de confusión.--\r\n     ¿Le daremos un susto?... No sé lo que pensará\r\n     la señora. Dígolo, porque esta noche estuve a verla, y me\r\n[20] pareció que la madre y la hija se reconciliaban.\r\n\r\n     --No sea usted bruto.... ¿Por qué no entra?\r\n\r\n     --Ahora me acuerdo de que los mozos armados ya no\r\n     están ahí, porque yo les mandé salir esta noche.\r\n\r\n     --Y aún duda este marmolejo lo que ha de hacer. Ramos,\r\n[25] no sea usted cobarde y entre en la huerta.\r\n\r\n     --¿Por dónde, si han cerrado la puertecilla?\r\n\r\n     --Salte usted por encima de la tapia.... ¡Qué pelmazo!\r\n     Si yo fuera hombre....\r\n\r\n     --Pues arriba.... Aquí hay unos ladrillos gastados\r\n[30] por donde suben los chicos a robar fruta.\r\n\r\n     --Arriba pronto. Yo voy a llamar a la puerta principal\r\n     para que despierte la señora, si es que duerme.\r\n\r\n     El Centauro subió, no sin dificultad. Montó a caballo\r\n     breve instante sobre el muro, y después desapareció entre\r\n     la negra espesura de los árboles. María Remedios corrió        213\r\n     desalada hacia la calle del Condestable, y cogiendo el aldabón\r\n     de la puerta principal, llamó... llamó tres veces con\r\n     toda el alma y la vida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXXI\r\n\r\n                             Doña Perfecta\r\n\r\n[5]  Ved con cuánta tranquilidad se consagra a la escritura la\r\n     señora doña Perfecta. Penetrad en su cuarto, a pesar de lo\r\n     avanzado de la hora, y la sorprenderéis en grave tarea,\r\n     compartido su espíritu entre la meditación y unas largas y\r\n     concienzudas cartas que traza a ratos con segura pluma y\r\n[10] correctos perfiles. Dale de lleno en el rostro y busto y manos\r\n     la luz del quinqué, cuya pantalla deja en dulce penumbra\r\n     el resto de la persona y la pieza casi toda. Parece una\r\n     figura luminosa evocada por la imaginación en medio de las\r\n     vagas sombras del miedo.\r\n\r\n[15] Es extraño que hasta ahora no hayamos hecho una afirmación\r\n     muy importante, y es que doña Perfecta era hermosa,\r\n     mejor dicho, era todavía hermosa, conservando en su semblante\r\n     rasgos de acabada belleza. La vida del campo, la falta\r\n     absoluta de presunción, el no vestirse, el no acicalarse, el\r\n[20] odio a las modas, el desprecio de las vanidades cortesanas\r\n     eran causa de que su nativa hermosura no brillase o brillase\r\n     muy poco. También la desmejoraba la intensa amarillez que\r\n     tenía su rostro, indicando una fuerte constitución biliosa.\r\n\r\n     Negros y rasgados los ojos, fina y delicada la nariz, ancha\r\n[25] y despejada la frente, todo observador la consideraba como\r\n     acabado tipo de la humana figura; pero había en aquellas\r\n     facciones cierta expresión de dureza y soberbia que era\r\n     causa de antipatía. Así como otras personas, aun siendo\r\n     feas, llaman, doña Perfecta despedía. Su mirar, aun acompañado\r\n[30] de bondadosas palabras, ponía entre ella y las personas\r\n     extrañas la infranqueable distancia de un respeto              214\r\n     receloso; mas para las de casa, es decir, para sus deudos,\r\n     parciales y allegados, tenía una singular atracción. Era\r\n     maestra en dominar, y nadie la igualó en el arte de hablar\r\n\r\n     Su hechura biliosa, y el comercio excesivo con personas\r\n     y cosas devotas, que exaltaban sin fruto ni objeto su imaginación,\r\n     la habían envejecido prematuramente, y siendo joven\r\n     no lo parecía. Podría decirse de ella que con sus hábitos y\r\n[10] su sistema de vida se había labrado una corteza, un forro\r\n     pétreo, insensible, encerrándose dentro como el caracol en\r\n     su casa portátil. Doña Perfecta salía pocas veces de su\r\n     concha.\r\n\r\n     Sus costumbres intachables, y aquella bondad pública que\r\n[15] hemos observado en ella desde el momento de su aparición\r\n     en nuestro relato, eran causa de su gran prestigio en Orbajosa.\r\n     Sostenía además relaciones con excelentes damas de\r\n     Madrid, y por este medio consiguió la destitución de su\r\n     sobrino. Ahora, en el momento presente de nuestra historia,\r\n[20] la hallamos sentada junto al pupitre, que es el confidente\r\n     único de sus planes y el depositario de sus cuentas\r\n     numéricas con los aldeanos, y de sus cuentas morales con\r\n     Dios y la sociedad. Allí escribió las cartas que trimestralmente\r\n     recibía su hermano; allí redactaba las esquelitas\r\n[25] para incitar al juez y al escribano a que embrollaran los\r\n     pleitos de Pepe Rey; allí armó el lazo en que éste perdiera\r\n     la confianza del Gobierno; allí conferenciaba largamente\r\n     con D. Inocencio. Para conocer el escenario de otras\r\n     acciones cuyos efectos hemos visto, sería preciso seguirla al\r\n[30] palacio episcopal y a varias casas de familias amigas.\r\n\r\n     No sabemos cómo hubiera sido doña Perfecta amando.\r\n     Aborreciendo tenía la inflamada vehemencia de un ángel tutelar\r\n     del odio y de la discordia entre los hombres. Tal es el\r\n     resultado producido en un carácter duro y sin bondad nativa\r\n     por la exaltación religiosa, cuando ésta, en vez de nutrirse   215\r\n     de la conciencia y de la verdad revelada en principios tan\r\n     sencillos como hermosos, busca su savia en fórmulas estrechas\r\n     que sólo obedecen a intereses eclesiásticos. Para que\r\n[5]  la mojigatería sea inofensiva, es preciso que exista en corazones\r\n     muy puros. Es verdad que aun en este caso es infecunda\r\n     para el bien. Pero los corazones que han nacido sin\r\n     la seráfica limpieza que establece en la tierra un Limbo prematuro,\r\n     cuidan bien de no inflamarse mucho con lo que ven\r\n[10] en los retablos, en los coros, en los locutorios y en las\r\n     sacristías, si antes no han elevado en su propia conciencia un\r\n     altar, un pulpito y un confesonario.\r\n\r\n     La señora, dejando a ratos la escritura, pasaba a la pieza\r\n     inmediata donde estaba su hija. A Rosarito se le había\r\n[15] mandado que durmiera; pero ella, precipitada ya por el\r\n     despeñadero de la desobediencia, velaba.\r\n\r\n     --¿Por qué no duermes?--le preguntó su madre.--Yo\r\n     no pienso acostarme en toda la noche. Ya sabes que Caballuco\r\n     se ha llevado los hombres que teníamos aquí. Puede\r\n[20] suceder cualquier cosa, y yo vigilo.... Si yo no vigilara,\r\n     ¿qué sería de ti y de mí?...\r\n\r\n     --¿Qué hora es?--preguntó la muchacha.\r\n\r\n     --Pronto será media noche.... Tú no tendrás miedo\r\n     ... pero yo lo tengo.\r\n\r\n[25] Rosarito temblaba, y todo indicaba en ella la más negra\r\n     congoja. Sus ojos se dirigían al cielo como cuando se\r\n     quiere orar; miraban luego a su madre, expresando un vivo\r\n     terror.\r\n\r\n     --¿Pero qué tienes?\r\n\r\n[30] --¿Ha dicho usted que era media noche?\r\n\r\n     --Sí.\r\n\r\n     --Pues.... ¿Pero es ya media noche?\r\n\r\n     Rosario quería hablar, sacudía la cabeza, encima de la\r\n     cual se le había puesto un mundo.\r\n\r\n     --Tú tienes algo... a ti te pasa algo--dijo la madre           216\r\n     clavando en ella los sagaces ojos.\r\n\r\n     --Sí... quería decirle a usted--balbució la muchacha,--\r\n     quería decir... Nada, nada, me dormiré.\r\n\r\n[5]  --Rosario, Rosario. Tu madre lee en tu corazón como\r\n     en un libro--exclamó doña Perfecta con severidad.--Tú\r\n     estás agitada. Ya te he dicho que estoy dispuesta a perdonarte\r\n     si te arrepientes; si eres niña buena y formal...\r\n\r\n     --Pues qué, ¿no soy buena yo? ¡Ay, mamá, mamá mía,\r\n[10] yo me muero!\r\n\r\n     Rosario porrumpió en llanto congojoso y dolorido.\r\n\r\n     --¿A qué vienen esos lloros?--dijo su madre abrazándola.--\r\n     Si son lágrimas del arrepentimiento, benditas sean.\r\n\r\n     --Yo no me arrepiento, yo no puedo arrepentirme--gritó\r\n[15] la joven con arrebato de desesperación que la puso sublime.\r\n\r\n     Irguió la cabeza, y en su semblante se pintó súbita, inspirada\r\n     energía. Los cabellos le caían sobre la espalda. No\r\n     se ha visto imagen más hermosa de un ángel dispuesto a\r\n     rebelarse.\r\n\r\n[20] --¿Pero te vuelves loca o qué es esto?--dijo doña Perfecta,\r\n     poniéndole ambas manos sobre los hombros.\r\n\r\n     --¡Me voy, me voy!--dijo la joven, expresándose con\r\n     la exaltación del delirio.\r\n\r\n     Y se lanzó fuera del lecho.\r\n\r\n[25] --Rosario, Rosario... Hija mía... ¡Por Dios!\r\n     ¿Qué es esto?\r\n\r\n     --¡Ay! mamá, señora--exclamó la joven, abrazándose\r\n     a su madre.--Áteme usted.\r\n\r\n     --En verdad, lo merecías... ¿Qué locura es esta?\r\n\r\n[30] --Áteme usted... Yo me marcho, me marcho con él.\r\n\r\n     Doña Perfecta sintió borbotones de fuego que subían de\r\n     su corazón a sus labios. Se contuvo, y sólo con sus ojos\r\n     negros, más negros que la noche, contestó a su hija.\r\n\r\n     --¡Mamá, mamá mía, yo aborrezco todo lo que no sea\r\n     él!--exclamó Rosario.--Óigame usted en confesión, porque       217\r\n     quiero confesarlo a todos, y a usted la primera.\r\n\r\n     --Me vas a matar, me estás matando.\r\n\r\n     --Yo quiero confesarlo, para que usted me perdone...\r\n[5]  Este peso, este peso que tengo encima no me deja vivir...\r\n\r\n     --¡El peso de un pecado!... Añádele encima la\r\n     maldición de Dios, y prueba a andar con ese fardo, desgraciada\r\n     ... Sólo yo puedo quitártelo.\r\n\r\n     --No, usted no, usted no--gritó Rosario con desesperación.--\r\n[10] Pero óigame usted, quiero confesarlo todo, todo\r\n     ... Después arrójeme usted de esta casa, donde he\r\n     nacido.\r\n\r\n     --¡Arrojarte yo!...\r\n\r\n     --Pues me marcharé.\r\n\r\n[15] --Menos. Yo te enseñaré los deberes de hija que has\r\n     olvidado.\r\n\r\n     --Pues huiré; él me llevará consigo.\r\n\r\n     --¿Te lo ha dicho, te lo ha aconsejado, te lo ha mandado?\r\n     --preguntó la madre, lanzando estas palabras como rayos\r\n[20] sobre su hija.\r\n\r\n     --Me lo aconseja... Hemos concertado casarnos.\r\n     Es preciso, mamá, mamá mía querida. Yo la amaré a usted\r\n     ... Conozco que debo amarla... Me condenaré si no\r\n     la amo.\r\n\r\n[25] Se retorcía los brazos, y cayendo de rodillas, besó los\r\n     pies a su madre.\r\n\r\n     --¡Rosario, Rosario!--exclamó doña Perfecta con terrible\r\n     acento.--Levántate.\r\n\r\n     Hubo una pequeña pausa.\r\n\r\n[30] --¿Ese hombre, te ha escrito?\r\n\r\n     --Sí.\r\n\r\n     --¿Le has vuelto a ver después de aquella noche?\r\n\r\n     --Sí.\r\n\r\n     --¡Y tú!...\r\n\r\n     --Yo también... ¡Oh! señora. ¿Por qué me mira                  218\r\n     usted así? Usted no es mi madre.\r\n\r\n     --Ojalá no. Gózate en el daño que me haces. Me\r\n     matas, me matas sin remedio--gritó la señora con indecible\r\n[5]  agitación.--Dices que ese hombre...\r\n\r\n     --Es mi esposo... Yo seré suya, protegida por la ley\r\n     ... Usted no es mujer... ¿Por qué me mira usted de\r\n     ese modo que me hace temblar? Madre, madre mía, no me\r\n     condene usted.\r\n\r\n[10] --Ya tú te has condenado; basta. Obedéceme y te perdonaré\r\n     ... Responde: ¿cuándo recibiste cartas de ese\r\n     hombre?\r\n\r\n     --Hoy.\r\n\r\n     --¡Qué traición! ¡Qué infamia!--exclamó la madre,\r\n[15] antes bien rugiendo que hablando.--¿Esperabais veros?\r\n\r\n     --Sí.\r\n\r\n     --¿Cuándo?\r\n\r\n     --Esta noche.\r\n\r\n     --¿Dónde?\r\n\r\n[20] --Aquí, aquí. Todo lo confieso, todo. Sé que es un\r\n     delito... Soy una infame; pero usted, que es mi madre,\r\n     me sacará de este infierno. Consienta usted... Dígame\r\n     usted una palabra, una sola.\r\n\r\n     --¡Ese hombre aquí, en mi casa!--gritó doña Perfecta,\r\n[25] dando algunos pasos que parecían saltos hacia el centro de\r\n     la habitación.\r\n\r\n     Rosario la siguió de rodillas. En el mismo instante oyéronse\r\n     tres golpes, tres estampidos, tres cañonazos. Era el\r\n     corazón de María Remedios que tocaba a la puerta, agitando\r\n[30] la aldaba. La casa se estremecía con temblor pavoroso.\r\n     Madre e hija se quedaron como estatuas.\r\n\r\n     Bajó a abrir un criado, y poco después en la habitación\r\n     de doña Perfecta entró María Remedios, que no era mujer,\r\n     sino un basilisco envuelto en un mantón. Su rostro, encendido  219\r\n     por la ansiedad, despedía fuego.\r\n\r\n     --- Ahí está, ahí está--dijo al entrar.--Se ha metido en\r\n     la huerta por la puertecilla condenada...\r\n\r\n[5]  Tomaba aliento a cada sílaba.\r\n\r\n     --Ya entiendo--repitió doña Perfecta con una especie\r\n     de bramido.\r\n\r\n     Rosario cayó exánime al suelo y perdió el conocimiento.\r\n\r\n     --Bajemos--dijo doña Perfecta sin hacer caso del desmayo\r\n[10] de su hija.\r\n\r\n     Las dos mujeres se deslizaron por la escalera como dos\r\n     culebras. Las criadas y el criado estaban en la galería sin\r\n     saber qué hacer. Doña Perfecta pasó por el comedor a la\r\n     huerta, seguida de María Remedios.\r\n\r\n[15] --Afortunadamente tenemos ahí a Ca... Ca... Caballuco\r\n     --dijo la sobrina del canónigo.\r\n\r\n     --¿Dónde?\r\n\r\n     --En la huerta también... Sal... sal... saltó la\r\n     tapia.\r\n\r\n[20] Doña Perfecta exploró la obscuridad con sus ojos llenos\r\n     de ira. El rencor les daba la singular videncia de la raza\r\n     felina.\r\n\r\n     --Allí veo un bulto--dijo.--Va hacia las adelfas.\r\n\r\n     --Es él--gritó Remedios.--Pero allá aparece Ramos...\r\n[25] ¡Ramos!\r\n\r\n     Distinguieron perfectamente la colosal figura del Centauro.\r\n\r\n     --¡Hacia las adelfas!... ¡Ramos, hacia las adelfas!...\r\n\r\n     Doña Perfecta adelantó algunos pasos. Su voz ronca,\r\n     que vibraba con acento terrible, disparó estas palabras:\r\n\r\n[30] --Cristóbal, Cristóbal... ¡mátale!\r\n\r\n     Oyóse un tiro. Después otro.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    220\r\n\r\n                                  XXXII\r\n\r\n                                  FINAL\r\n\r\n            De D. Cayetano Polentinos a un su amigo de Madrid\r\n\r\n     _Orbajosa 21 de Abril_.\r\n\r\n     \"Querido amigo: Envíeme usted sin tardanza la edición\r\n     de 1562 que dice ha encontrado entre los libros de la testamentaría\r\n     de Corchuelo. Pago ese ejemplar a cualquier\r\n     precio. Hace tiempo que lo busco inútilmente, y me tendré\r\n[5]  por mortal virtuosísimo poseyéndolo. Ha de hallar usted\r\n     en el colophón un casco con emblema sobre la palabra _Tractado_,\r\n     y la X de la fecha MDLXII ha de tener el rabillo\r\n     torcido. Si en efecto concuerdan estas señas con el ejemplar,\r\n     póngame usted un parte telegráfico, porque estoy muy\r\n[10] inquieto... aunque ahora me acuerdo de que el telégrafo,\r\n     con motivo de estas importunas y fastidiosas guerras, no\r\n     funciona. A correo vuelto espero la contestación.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Pronto, amigo mío, pasaré a Madrid con objeto de\r\n     imprimir este tan esperado trabajo de los _Linajes de Orbajosa_.\r\n[15] Agradezco a usted su benevolencia, mi querido amigo;\r\n     pero no puedo admitirla en lo que tiene de lisonja. No\r\n     merece mi trabajo, en verdad, los pomposos calificativos\r\n     con que usted lo encarece; es obra de paciencia y estudio,\r\n     monumento tosco, pero sólido y grande, que elevo a las\r\n[20] grandezas de mi amada patria. Pobre y feo en su hechura,\r\n     tiene de noble la idea que lo ha engendrado, la cual no es\r\n     otra que convertir los ojos de esta generación descreída y\r\n     soberbia hacia los maravillosos hechos y acrisoladas virtudes\r\n     de nuestros antepasados. ¡Ojalá que la juventud estudiosa\r\n     de nuestro país diera este paso a que con todas mis\r\n     fuerzas la incito! ¡Ojala fueran puestos en perpetuo olvido\r\n     los abominables estudios y hábitos intelectuales introducidos\r\n     por el desenfreno filosófico y las erradas doctrinas! ¡Ojalá\r\n     se emplearan exclusivamente nuestros sabios en la contemplación 221\r\n     de aquellas gloriosas edades, para que, penetrados\r\n     de la substancia y benéfica savia de ellas los modernos\r\n     tiempos, desapareciera este loco afán de mudanzas y esta\r\n[5]  ridicula manía de apropiarnos ideas extrañas, que pugnan]\r\n     con nuestro primoroso organismo nacional. Temo mucho\r\n     que mis deseos no se vean cumplidos, y que la contemplación\r\n     de las perfecciones pasadas quede circunscrita al estrecho\r\n     círculo en que hoy se halla, entre el torbellino de la\r\n[10] demente juventud que corre detrás de vanas utopias y bárbaras\r\n     novedades. ¿Cómo ha de ser, amigo mío? Creo que\r\n     dentro de algún tiempo ha de estar nuestra pobre España\r\n     tan desfigurada, que no se conocerá ella misma ni aun mirándose\r\n     en el clarísimo espejo de su limpia historia.\"\r\n\r\n[15] \"No quiero levantar mano de esta carta sin participar a\r\n     usted un suceso desagradable: la desastrosa muerte de un\r\n     estimable joven, muy conocido en Madrid, el ingeniero de\r\n     caminos D. José de Rey, sobrino de mi cuñada. Acaeció\r\n     este triste suceso anoche en la huerta de nuestra casa, y aún\r\n[20] no he formado juicio exacto sobre las causas que pudieron\r\n     arrastrar al desgraciado Rey a esta horrible y criminal\r\n     determinación. Según me ha referido Perfecta esta mañana\r\n     cuando volví de Mundogrande, Pepe Rey, a eso de las\r\n     doce de la noche, penetró en la huerta de esta casa y se\r\n[25] pegó un tiro en la sien derecha, quedando muerto en el acto.\r\n     Figúrese usted la consternación y alarma que se producirían\r\n     en esta pacífica y honrada mansión. La pobre Perfecta se\r\n     impresionó tan vivamente, que nos hemos asustado; pero\r\n     ya está mejor, y esta tarde hemos logrado que tome un sopicaldo.\r\n[30] Empleamos todos los medios de consolarla, y como\r\n     es buena cristiana, sabe soportar con edificante resignación\r\n     las mayores desgracias.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Acá, para entre los dos, amigo mío, diré a usted que en\r\n     el terrible atentado del joven Rey contra su propia existencía,\r\n     debió influir grandemente una pasión contrariada, tal          222\r\n     vez los remordimientos por su conducta y el estado de hipocondría\r\n     amarguísima en que se encontraba su espíritu. Yo\r\n     le apreciaba mucho; creo que no carecía de excelentes\r\n[5]  cualidades; pero aquí estaba tan mal estimado, que ni una\r\n     sola vez oí hablar bien de él. Según dicen, hacía alarde de\r\n     ideas y opiniones extravagantísimas; burlábase de la religión;\r\n     entraba en la iglesia fumando y con el sombrero\r\n     puesto; no respetaba nada, y para él no había en el mundo\r\n[10] pudor, ni virtudes, ni alma, ni ideal, ni fe, sino tan sólo\r\n     teodolitos, escuadras, reglas, máquinas, niveles, picos y\r\n     azadas. ¿Qué tal? En honor de la verdad, debo decir que\r\n     en sus conversaciones conmigo, siempre disimuló tales ideas,\r\n     sin duda por miedo a ser destrozado por la metralla de mis\r\n[15] argumentos; pero de público se refieren de él mil cuentos\r\n     de herejías y estupendos desafueros.\"\r\n\r\n     \"No puedo seguir, querido, porque en este momento\r\n     siento tiros de fusilería. Como no me entusiasman los\r\n     combates, ni soy guerrero, el pulso me flaquea un tantico.\r\n[20] Ya le impondrá a usted de ciertos pormenores de esta guerra\r\n     su afectísimo, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _22 de Abril._\r\n\r\n     \"Mi inolvidable amigo: Hoy hemos tenido una sangrienta\r\n     refriega en las inmediaciones de Orbajosa. La gran\r\n     partida levantada en Villahorrenda ha sido atacada por las\r\n[25] tropas con gran coraje. Ha habido muchas bajas por una\r\n     y otra parte. Después se dispersaron los bravos guerrilleros;\r\n     pero van muy envalentonados, y quizá oiga usted\r\n     maravillas. Mándalos, a pesar de estar herido en un brazo,\r\n     no se sabe cómo ni cuándo, Cristóbal Caballuco, hijo de\r\n[30] aquel egregio Caballuco que usted conoció en la pasada\r\n     guerra. Es el caudillo actual de grandes condiciones para\r\n     el mando, y además honrado y sencillo. Como al fin hemos\r\n     de presenciar un arreglito amistoso, presumo que Caballuco    223\r\n     será general del ejército español, con lo cual uno y otro\r\n     ganarán mucho.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Yo deploro esta guerra, que va tomando proporciones\r\n[5]  alarmantes; pero reconozco que nuestros bravos campesinos\r\n     no son responsables de ella, pues han sido provocados\r\n     al cruento batallar por la audacia del Gobierno; por la\r\n     desmoralización de sus sacrilegos delegados; por la saña\r\n     sistemática con que los representantes del Estado atacan lo\r\n[10] más venerando que existe en la conciencia de los pueblos,\r\n     la fe religiosa y el acrisolado españolismo, que por fortuna\r\n     se conservan en lugares no infestados aún de la asoladora\r\n     pestilencia. Cuando a un pueblo se le quiere quitar su\r\n     alma para infundirle otra; cuando se le quiere descastar,\r\n[15] digámoslo así, mudando sus sentimientos, sus costumbres,\r\n     sus ideas, es natural que ese pueblo se defienda, como el\r\n     que en mitad de solitario camino se ve asaltado de infames\r\n     ladrones. Lleven a las esferas del Gobierno el espíritu y\r\n     la pura salutífera substancia de mi obra de los _Linajes_\r\n[20] (perdóneme usted la inmodestia), y entonces no habrá\r\n     guerras.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Hoy hemos tenido aquí una cuestión muy desagradable.\r\n     El clero, amigo mío, se ha negado a enterrar en sepultura\r\n     sagrada al infeliz Rey. Yo he intervenido en este asunto,\r\n[25] impetrando del señor obispo que levantara anatema de tanto\r\n     peso; pero nada se ha podido conseguir. Por fin hemos\r\n     empaquetado el cuerpo del joven en un hoyo que se hizo en\r\n     el campo de Mundogrande, donde mis pacienzudas exploraciones\r\n     han descubierto la riqueza arqueológica que usted\r\n[30] conoce. He pasado un rato muy triste, y aún me dura la\r\n     penosísima impresión que recibí. D. Juan Tafetán y yo\r\n     somos los únicos que acompañaron el fúnebre cortejo. Poco\r\n     después fueron allá (cosa rara) esas que llaman aquí las\r\n     Troyas, y rezaron largo rato sobre la rústica tumba del matemático.\r\n     Aunque esto parecía una oficiosidad ridícula, me               224\r\n     conmovió.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Respecto de la muerte de Rey, corre por el pueblo el\r\n     rumor de que fué asesinado. No se sabe por quién. Aseguran\r\n[5]  que él lo declaró así, pues vivió como hora y media.\r\n     Guardó secreto, según dicen, respecto a quién fué su matador.\r\n     Repito esta versión sin desmentirla ni apoyarla.\r\n     Perfecta no quiere que se hable de este asunto, y se aflige\r\n     mucho siempre que lo tomo en boca.\"\r\n\r\n[10] \"La pobrecita, apenas ocurrida una desgracia, experimenta\r\n     otra que a todos nos contrista mucho. Amigo mío,\r\n     ya ha hecho una nueva víctima la funestísima y rancia\r\n     enfermedad connaturalizada en nuestra familia. La pobre\r\n     Rosario, que iba saliendo adelante, gracias a nuestros cuidados,\r\n[15] está ya perdida de la cabeza. Sus palabras incoherentes,\r\n     su atroz delirio, su palidez mortal, recuérdanme a mi\r\n     madre y hermana. Este caso es el más grave que he presenciado\r\n     en mi familia, pues no se trata de manías, sino de\r\n     verdadera locura. Es triste, tristísimo, que entre tantos yo\r\n[20] sea el único que ha logrado escapar conservando mi juicio\r\n     sano y entero, y totalmente libre de ese funesto mal.\"\r\n\r\n     \"No he podido dar sus expresiones de usted a D. Inocencio,\r\n     porque el pobrecito se nos ha puesto malo de repente,\r\n     y no recibe a nadie ni permite que le vean sus más íntimos\r\n[25] amigos. Pero estoy seguro de que le devuelve a usted sus\r\n     recuerdos, y no dude que pondrá mano al instante en la\r\n     traducción de varios epigramas latinos que usted le recomienda....\r\n     Suenan tiros otra vez.

Extraño mucho que no habiéndolo\r\n     dicho yo a nadie más que a usted, lo cuenten aquí con todos\r\n     sus pelos y señales, explicando cómo entró en la huerta,\r\n     cómo descargó su revólver sobre Caballuco cuando vió que\r\n     éste le acometía con la navaja, cómo Ramos le disparó después\r\n[20] con tanto acierto que le dejó en el sitio.... En fin,\r\n     mi querido amigo, por si inadvertidamente ha hablado de\r\n     esto con alguien, le recuerdo que es un secreto de familia,\r\n     y con esto basta para una persona tan prudente y discreta\r\n     como usted.\"\r\n\r\n[25] \"Albricias, albricias.

Ya no\r\n     tenemos Penitenciario, no precisamente porque haya pasado\r\n     a mejor vida, sino porque el pobrecito está desde el mes\r\n[30] de Abril tan acongojado, tan melancólico, tan taciturno, que\r\n     no se le conoce. Ya no hay en él ni siquiera dejos de aquel\r\n     humor ático, de aquella jovialidad correcta y clásica que le\r\n     hacía tan amable.

Quizás le\r\n     llevará una ambicioncilla (pues también la tiene) a las lides\r\n[20] políticas, y creo que no sería mala ganancia para la causa\r\n     del orden y la tradición, hoy que la juventud está pervertida\r\n     y acaparada por los _de la cáscara amarga_. Acompáñale su\r\n     madre, una mujer ordinaria y sin barniz social, pero que\r\n     tiene un corazón excelente y acendrada piedad. El amor\r\n[25] materno toma en ella la forma algo abigarrada de la ambición\r\n     mundana, y dice que su hijo ha de ser Ministro. Bien\r\n     puede serlo.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Perfecta me da expresiones para usted. No sé a punto\r\n     fijo qué tiene; pero ello es que nos inspira cuidado.

La pobre\r\n     Perfecta habla frecuentemente de esta nube, que cada vez se\r\n     pone más negra, mientras ella se vuelve cada día más\r\n[5]  amarilla.

The conditional is here used without\r\nany sense of a condition implied; it represents a future of necessity or\r\nintention (equivalent to Eng. 'is to do a thing'), thrown into the past\r\nby the sequence of narration.\r\n\r\n=3= 20 =cargaría=: for tense see n. on =1.= 173. The verb =cargar= means\r\neither 'load' or 'take on a load,' 'carry as a load.'\r\n\r\n=3= 23 =se iba escurriendo=: R. 528; K. 208; C. 207, 5.\r\n\r\n=3= 26 =lanzó=: the subject is =el tren=, i.e. the engine (=máquina=).\r\n\r\n=4= 1 =empezada la caminata=: R. 1228, 2; K. 741; C. 276, 5.\r\n\r\n=4= 3 =de muy buen ver=: 'of very good appearance,' 'very good to look\r\nupon.' R. 1206, rem. 1.\r\n\r\n=4= 8 =vamos al caso=: 'let us come to the point.'\r\n\r\n=4= 13 =Así viviera=: 'I wish... might live.' =Así= is often used to\r\nintroduce a wish (C. 282, 3,_c_). The usage probably arose from phrases\r\nof asseveration, like the Eng. 'so may I prosper as I tell the truth.'\r\n\r\n=4= 14 =que le echan en la tierra=: 'which they' (i.e. people) 'bestow\r\nupon her on earth.'\r\n\r\n=4= 17 =Bien haya quien a los suyos parece=: 'a blessing on one who is\r\nlike his own (family),' colloquial phrase derived from the proverb\r\n\"Quien a los suyos se parece, honra merece.\" R. 860; K. 353,_a_; C. p.\r\n229, n.\r\n\r\n=4= 22 =Poco va de Pedro a Pedro=: 'Peter and Peter [i. e. you and she]\r\nare pretty nearly even'; the proverb says =algo= (or =mucho=) =va de\r\nPedro a Pedro=, 'there's quite a difference in Peters,' i.e. in persons\r\nwho might be classed together.\r\n\r\n=4= 24 =metidillo en=: 'up to his ears in'; past participle of =meter=,\r\nwith diminutive termination perhaps implying depreciation. Words formed\r\nwith diminutive, augmentative, or depreciative suffixes are given in the\r\nvocabulary of this book with appropriate definitions; but in general\r\ndictionaries they are not individually given, because of the inordinate\r\nbulk which a list of them all would have. The user of the dictionary is\r\nexpected to recognize the suffix and its force, and to find in the\r\ndictionary the word to which the suffix is appended. The student must\r\ntherefore form the habit of consulting over and over those pages of his\r\ngrammar which deal with these suffixes, and of recognizing at sight such\r\northographical changes of consonants as those by which =poco= with\r\n=-ito= makes =poquito=, and =pez= with =-ecillo= (longer form of\r\n=-illo=) makes =pececillo=.\r\n\r\n=5= 3 =que no viven=: 'fit to die.' An idiomatic phrase of emphasis.\r\n\r\n=5= 4 =de que callen=, etc.: i.e. for talking face to face.\r\n\r\n=5= 6 =Amanecerá Dios=, etc.: idiomatic expression used either for\r\npostponing a disagreeable thing or for indicating an expectation of\r\nsomething good impending. The impersonal verb expressing a phenomenon of\r\nthe sky is treated as personal with God as subject.\r\n\r\n=5= 10 =uno piensa el bayo=, etc.: 'the bay horse thinks one thing, the\r\nman who saddles him something else,' i.e. it takes two to make a\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\n=5= 12 =buen mozo=: 'fine fellow.'\r\n\r\n=5= 15 =iba=: 'was'; cf. K. 389,_a_.\r\n\r\n=5= 18 =echar por=: 'turn into.'\r\n\r\n=5= 30 =ni=: 'not even.' R. 752.\r\n\r\n=5= 33 =hombre de Dios=: 'man alive.' The word =hombre= is one of the\r\ncommonest interjectional expressions in Spanish, and is constantly used\r\nwith little or no sense of addressing a particular person; C. 237, 9.\r\nThe addition of =de Dios= merely strengthens it.\r\n\r\n=6= 15 =veo=: 'I have seen.' Cf. p. 5, ll. 23, 24 ('have been traveling'\r\netc.).\r\n\r\n=6= 19 =caza mayor y menor=: 'hunting of large and small game.'\r\n\r\n=6= 20 =todo lo había=: 'there was everything.'

Derived originally from the Arabs, this\r\npoor apparatus is still common all over Spain.\r\n\r\n=6= 32 =garbanzo=: the chick-pea, a small-leaved bushy plant bearing in\r\neach pod two large wrinkled peas, is an important crop from Spain to\r\nIndia, and especially famous as the national bean of Spain.--=de lo que\r\nno hay=: 'not to be matched.'\r\n\r\n=6= 34 =cuarto=: small Spanish coin of the olden time, equivalent to\r\nfour maravedis, or one thirty-fourth of a peseta (20 cents). Now\r\nmentioned only as the smallest conceivable sum of money; not in actual\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n=7= 5 =me los van cercenando=: 'keep shearing them off [for me].' So the\r\nearlier Madrid editions; cf. p. 65, l. 21. Later editions have =va=, as\r\nif the plough were subject.--=me=: R. 323; K. 193.\r\n\r\n=7= 6 =mojones, ni linderos=: properties, especially large properties,\r\nare often not fenced in Spain, and ownership is determined by means of\r\nposts, piles of stones, and other traditional landmarks.\r\n\r\n=7= 13 =roe que roe=: C. 233, _b_.--=fanegadas=: antiquated measure\r\nsupposed to be land enough for a fanega of seed. In Castile =fanega= =\r\n1.575 bushels, =fanegada= = 1.6 acres; in other provinces otherwise.\r\n\r\n=7= 14 =escuela=: i.e. =de filosofía=.\r\n\r\n=7= 16 =quien las sabe las tañe=: 'he who knows 'em, plays 'em.' =Las=\r\nis often used idiomatically for those things in general suggested by the\r\nphrase in which it stands (e.g. =las de Pepe=, 'Joe's tricks,' 'Joe's\r\nways,' cf. K. 267, _a_; C. 201); here for tunes, instruments, tricks, or\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\n=7= 19 =ver=: depends on =puede= above.--=de=: 'about.'\r\n\r\n=7= 21 =no sea=: 'may not be'; subjunctive in independent clauses with\r\nadverbs of doubt (C. 213, 1); so with =tal vez=, p. 68, l. 8.\r\n\r\n=8= 16 =desde más alto=: 'from a higher position.'\r\n\r\n=8= 20 =que se pone al sol=: 'sunning himself.'\r\n\r\n=8= 24 =picará=: 'will bite' (primarily said of mustard etc.).\r\n\r\n=9= 9 =serán=: R. 1195; K. 703, _c_; C. 266.\r\n\r\n=9= 26 =unas=: R. 641; K. 344, _b_; C. 179, 3.\r\n\r\n=9= 29 =Guardia civil=: 'the Civil Guard,' a select body of Spanish\r\npolice, armed and disciplined like soldiers, whose particular business\r\nis guarding highways and railroads. In pairs =(parejas)= these guards\r\npatrol the roads and accompany all trains. Kept as isolated from the\r\ncommunity as possible and at a high point of efficiency, they are much\r\nfeared by the rabble. The cruelty of their treatment of prisoners\r\ndescribed a little further on accords with numerous actual occurrences\r\nin Spain; and, as will be remembered by those who have paid attention to\r\nthe history of the foreign relations of the United States during the\r\nearly part of Wilson's administration, it is exactly the process by\r\nwhich President Madero of Mexico met his death while under arrest on\r\nFeb. 23, 1913.\r\n\r\n=10= 2 =a aquel sitio=: dir. obj. R. 1318: K. 750, _c_.\r\n\r\n=10= 5 =muertos=: R. 1143; K. 567.\r\n\r\n=10= 27 =debía de ser=: R. 1005, 2, rem.; C., Appendix II, 7.\r\n\r\n=10= 28 =coplas=: 'popular songs,' particularly the brief songs of a\r\nsingle quatrain peculiar to Spain.\r\n\r\n=11= 5 =retebién=: double intensive of =bien=. The ordinary intensive\r\nprefix for adjectives and adverbs is =re-=(R. 596; K. 159); but in\r\npopular speech this is often doubled, =rere-=, or takes the form =rete-=\r\n(C. 146, 3, _a_).\r\n\r\n=11= 8 =a lo mejor=: familiar phrase for the occurrence of an untoward\r\nevent at an unexpected moment (lit. when things are going as well as\r\npossible). Cf. =el mejor día=, p. 163, l. 13.\r\n\r\n=11= 10 =Se les lleva=: 'you're taking them.'\r\n\r\n=11= 12 =que=: cf. n. on p. 49, l. 17.\r\n\r\n=11= 13 =sumaria=: 'indictment.'--=requeridos=: 'examined,' or possibly,\r\nbut less probably, 'summoned.'\r\n\r\n=11= 17 =a más de largo=: 'besides being long.'\r\n\r\n=11= 33 =Partenón=: the Parthenon, or temple of Athena Parthenos,\r\nerected in Athens in the time of Pericles (5th cent. B.C.), had numerous\r\nhorses carved on its frieze and metopes.\r\n\r\n=12= 5 =tomado la delantera=: 'got the start of.'--=se pone a ello=:\r\n'set about it,' 'try.' R. 1360.\r\n\r\n=12= 13 =por muchos años=: abbr. expression of courtesy, '[may you live]\r\nfor many years.'\r\n\r\n=12= 23 =ha de ser=: R. 857; K. 353, _b_; C. 107, 3.\r\n\r\n=12= 31 =Ahí donde le ve=: 'just as you see him there,' common\r\nexpression used to forestall surprise at a statement about to be made\r\nconcerning a person or thing.--=cacique=: 'local political leader,'\r\n'boss.' The word is of Haitian Indian origin, meaning properly the head\r\nof an Indian family or tribe.\r\n\r\n=13= 1 =vuecencia=: contraction for =vuestra excelencia=.--=rétulo=:\r\nvulg. for =rótulo=, 'address.'--=Tira a la barra=: 'he throws the bar'\r\n(Spanish game, in which bars of iron of various shapes and sizes are\r\nthrown so as to fall point downward).--=San Cristóbal=: a saint and\r\nmartyr of the third century, traditionally famous for his size and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n=13= 3 =fielato=: 'inspectorship,' as of weights and measures; or, here,\r\nof the goods and provisions brought into a place, upon which toll must\r\nbe paid (= Fr. _octroi_).\r\n\r\n=13= 10 =Madriles=: provincial for =Madrileños=; used here for\r\n=Madrid=.\r\n\r\n=13= 15 =rematarlo él=: 'and he to execute it' (Eng. slang, 'put it\r\nthrough'). The construction is peculiar and noteworthy in Spanish.\r\n\r\n=13= 19 =andan diciendo=: R. 525; K. 734; C. 275.\r\n\r\n=13= 20 =vuelve a haber=: R. 1187; K. 725, _a_; C. 107, 5.\r\n\r\n=14 9 =!...=: the suspensive points represent the omitted object\r\n(perhaps Cristo) of the preposition de. In other words, the\r\ncorresponding punctuation in English would be '--!' not'!--.' It is the\r\nhabit of Spanish printers not to discriminate = ...!= from =!...= but to\r\nset always =!...= (this being the form that is oftener right than\r\nwrong), so that the reader of Spanish literature must be always ready to\r\nmake this mental transposition, though the cases where the points are to\r\nbe read as they stand are still more numerous. The same applies to\r\n=?...= also.\r\n\r\n=14= 26 =en lo más alto=: 'at the highest point.'\r\n\r\n=14= 32 =de hojalata=: because of the brightness of the water.\r\n\r\n=15= 16 =depósito de caballos sementales=: 'government horse-breeding\r\nstation.'\r\n\r\n=15= 26 =disgusto=: not 'disgust.'\r\n\r\n=16= 4 =tocando=: 'skirting.'\r\n\r\n=16= 10 =Justo y cabal=: 'exactly.'\r\n\r\n=16= 31 =Penitenciario=: a priest nominated by a bishop to hear\r\nconfession, impose penance, and grant absolution in reserved cases,--a\r\ncanon penitentiary.\r\n\r\n=17= 12 =de aquellos que no coge un galgo=: 'hard to catch,' 'elusive'\r\n(lit. 'of those which a greyhound does not catch').\r\n\r\n=17= 16 =hacer diabluras=: 'get into mischief.'\r\n\r\n=17= 27 =si más=, etc.: 'had not death been quicker to carry him off\r\nthan he was to squander it' (his fortune).\r\n\r\n=18= 21 =a flote=: a common colloquialism for having enough to pay\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n=18= 28 =sepa=: for mood, cf. R. 910; K. 710; C. 109, 3.\r\n\r\n=19= 5 =perogrulladas=: from the proverb \"Las verdades de Perogrullo,\r\nque a la mano cerrada llamaba puño.\"\r\n\r\n=19= 8 =Montblanch=: a town seventeen miles northwest of Tarragona. The\r\n=raya=, of course, is a railroad. It appears by the map that the two\r\nplaces lack direct connection, the railroad trip from the one to the\r\nother being a roundabout one through Reus.\r\n\r\n=19= 9 =el río Francolí=: a small river that falls into the\r\nMediterranean about one mile southwest of Tarragona.\r\n\r\n=19= 21 =e=: R. 72; K. 653; C. 232, I.\r\n\r\n=19= 28 =físico=: agrees with =cultura= (fem.) =y bienestar= (masc.).\r\n\r\n=21= 15 =_ergo tua rura manebunt_=: Vergil, _Ecl._ I, 47.\r\n\r\n=21= 26 =bajo el punto de vista minero=: 'from the mining point of\r\nview.'\r\n\r\n=21= 28 =dió lugar=: 'gave rise'; cf. the English idiom 'take place.'\r\n\r\n=21= 30 =noviazgo=: R., p. 498.\r\n\r\n=22= 25 =mistificaciones=: Madrid edition =mixtificaciones=; a common\r\nmisprint, since Spaniards pronounce =xt= as =st= (C. 5).\r\n\r\n=22= 27 =gongorismo=: 'Gongorism,' a literary style, so called from the\r\nSpanish writer Luis de Góngora y Argote (1561-1627). This style, which\r\nis similar in many ways to the affected manner called in England\r\nEuphuism, and in France and Italy Marinism, was distinguished by its\r\nelaborate and artificial expression of ideas, and by its frequent\r\nsubstitution of mere play upon words for solid thought.\r\n\r\n=23= 16 =las herraduras=: 'the horses' shoes.'\r\n\r\n=24= 7 =cuya=: 'which,' or 'the which.' This use of =cuyo= for =el cual=\r\nis pronounced improper by the best grammarians (e.g. Andrés Bello,\r\n_Gramática Castellana_, ed. Cuervo, section 1050). It is said to be of\r\nnotarial origin. Many excellent writers, however, employ it, and it is\r\nvery common in conversation.\r\n\r\n=24= 30 =_saudades_=: almost untranslatable Portuguese word, derived\r\nfrom the Latin _solitas_, 'loneliness.' It has come in Portuguese to\r\nmean the melancholy that arises from introspection and the vague\r\nyearnings of unsatisfied sentiment. The German _Weltschmerz_ expresses a\r\nsomewhat similar idea.\r\n\r\n=24= 33 =Enriqueta, Julia=: conventional names of heroines of novels.\r\nNot Spanish in tone. By comparing a list of eminent men in Spain with a\r\nsimilar list in the United States it will be seen that saints of the\r\nChurch furnish about two thirds of the Christian names in Spain, about\r\none third here; for women's names the contrast is still greater. Many\r\nSpanish women's names that do not look like saints' names are attributes\r\nof the Virgin; e.g. Rosario for Our Lady of the Rosary.\r\n\r\n=25= 12 =allí=: 'at that point.'\r\n\r\n=25= 18 =Estarás=: R. 1195; K. 703, _c_; C. 266.\r\n\r\n=26= 6 =un mueble de latón dorado=: i.e. a cuspidor.\r\n\r\n=26= 11 =correr el transparente=: 'draw the shade.' For trans. use of\r\n=correr= cf. R. 265.\r\n\r\n=26= 19 =testero=: 'façade' of a building; 'wall,' or 'side,' of a room.\r\n\r\n=27= 12 =Más días hay que longanizas=: 'there are more days than\r\nsausages'; i.e., time is a plentiful commodity.\r\n\r\n=27= 21 =Déle usted expresiones=: 'remember me to him.' Cf. R.,\r\nAppendix, pp. 610 ff.\r\n\r\n=27= 25 =Abur=: 'good-bye' (colloq. for =agur=, from Lat. _augurium_,\r\nthrough a Low Latin form _agurium_; K. 60, footnote). Not discourteous,\r\nbut more offhand in tone than the =adiós= of p. 28, l. 5.\r\n\r\n=27= 32 =lo tuyo=: 'what is yours,' 'your business.'\r\n\r\n=27= 34 =Hombre=: cf. n. on p. 5, l. 33.\r\n\r\n=28= 2 =Del lobo=, etc.: 'one hair of the wolf, and that from his\r\nforehead' (is sufficient). Proverb signifying that in dealing with what\r\nis bad, the less you get of it, the better for you.\r\n\r\n=29= 1 =la emprendió con=: 'fell to upon.' For use of =la= cf. n. on p.\r\n7, l. 16.\r\n\r\n=29= 21 =No hay que hablarme=: R. 867; K. 353, _c_; C. 107, 2.\r\n\r\n=30= 12 =cartoncejo=: the ending =-cejo= is unusual and contrary to the\r\nruling of the Academy (of which Galdós is a member); the Academy's rule\r\nis that =-ito,-illo,-ico,-uelo=, usually become =-cito= etc. when\r\naffixed to a word ending with =n=, but that of =-ajo,-ejo,-ijo=, only\r\n=-ajo= allows euphonic letters to be prefixed to it, and that without\r\nset rule.\r\n\r\n=30= 34 =ristras=: the noun 'trace,' the exact equivalent of =ristra=,\r\nis not in English dictionaries; but see the verb in Webster, and the\r\nnoun in the list of prizes of the Vermont State Fair, 1910. 'Rope' is a\r\nbetter-known word for the same thing.\r\n\r\n=31= 3 =la Corte=: 'the Capital,' Madrid.\r\n\r\n=31= 7 =de bancos=: the list ends abruptly with a pun on =saltabanco=,\r\n'mountebank,' 'street quack.' A translator, instead of giving =saltos de\r\naguas= its proper force of 'water powers,' will do well to represent it\r\nby something useful that puns with a proverbial swindle; e.g., say\r\n'fire-bricks, gold bricks.'\r\n\r\n=31= 16 =a uno=: dir. obj. of =tenemos=.\r\n\r\n=31= 23 =Nada=: 'enough said.' =Nada= is colloquially very common as a\r\npure interjection.\r\n\r\n=31= 34 =cuyas ... descoloridos=: each adjective agrees in gender with\r\nthe nearer of the modified nouns.\r\n\r\n=32= 4 =al descubierto=: 'uncovered,' 'unprotected.'\r\n\r\n=32= 10 =_Ferdinand Cortez, Donna Marine_=: italicized as being the\r\nFrench forms of the names =Hernán Cortés= (the conqueror of Mexico) and\r\n=Doña Marina= (the Mexican girl who was his companion and interpreter).\r\n\r\n=32= 17 =observándolo todo=: when =todo=, neuter, is object of a verb,\r\nthe use of =lo= is exactly opposite to that of English 'it'; that is, if\r\n=todo= refers to an identifiable antecedent, thus meaning 'it all,' =lo=\r\nis omitted (e.g. p. 3, l. 16), but if =todo= means simply 'everything,'\r\nwithout an 'it,' then =lo= must be inserted (e.g. p. 112, l. 2). But\r\nwhen =todo= is not object of a verb (e.g. p. 6, l. 3) no such rule\r\nholds. C. 203, 2, _a_.\r\n\r\n=32= 21 =empaque=: word used familiarly to indicate the traits of a\r\nperson that produce an impression at first sight, whether good or bad.\r\n\r\n=32= 24 =tiran a=: 'verge upon.'\r\n\r\n=33= 2 =debía de ser=: R. 1005, 2, rem.\r\n\r\n=33= 10 =_buquinista_=: italicized as not Spanish but Hispanicized\r\nFrench. _Bouquiniste_ is properly 'second-hand bookseller,' but the\r\nmeaning here may be 'book-collector.' A _bouquin_ is a conspicuously old\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n=34= 5 =merienda=: 'picnic.'\r\n\r\n=34= 22 =Mientras más, mejor=: 'the longer the better.'\r\n\r\n=34= 34 =acompañará usted=, etc.: i.e. by eating our Lenten fare.\r\n\r\n=35= 12 =López de Berganza=: this name, like many others of authors and\r\nbooks in the remainder of the story, is purely imaginary.\r\n\r\n=35= 15 =tenga=: cf. R. 914 and n. on p. 7, l. 21.\r\n\r\n=35= 16 =de hierro=: probably corrugated iron, which was one of the\r\nworld's recent and valued inventions about the time when _Doña Perfecta_\r\nwas written.\r\n\r\n=35= 25 =la octava=: i.e. one in addition to the traditional seven.\r\n\r\n=35= 26 =en buen hora=: originally this meant 'at an auspicious time.'\r\nIt is now a colloquial, often ironical, phrase of acquiescence or\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n=36= 3 =donde quiera=: cf. R. 896; K. 326; C. 197.\r\n\r\n=36= 19 =_maria ac terras, caelumque profundum_=: Vergil (_Aen._ I, 58\r\nf.) says that if Aeolus did not hold the winds in control, they\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Maria ac terras caelumque profundum\r\n     Quippe ferant rapidi secum verrantque per auras_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=36= 23 =gusanera=: strictly defined as a place where worms breed;\r\napparently meant here as a mass of worms, with reference to the look of\r\nthe surface of the brain, and doubtless with a pun on the colloquial use\r\nof =gusanera= for that reservoir of \"maggots\" (crotchets) whose contents\r\ncome out when you touch upon a man's hobby.\r\n\r\n=36= 24 =daba paso a=: 'sent down.'\r\n\r\n=37= 14 =martillazos=: for force of termination =-azo= cf. R. 1273 (p.\r\n499); K. 765, _b_, rem.; C. 132, 4, _b_. Cf. n. on p. 90, l. 29.\r\n\r\n=37= 30 =cazadora traviesa=: like Diana.\r\n\r\n=37= 31 =cochero emperegilado y vagabundo=: like Phaëthon.\r\n\r\n=37= 34 =Mercurio=: the god of commerce.--=Manzanedo=: the firm of\r\nManzanedo is a leading Madrid banking house.\r\n\r\n=38= 1 =barbilampiño=: Spaniards regard abundance of hair as an evidence\r\nof force. The allusion is to the well-known frail look of Count von\r\nMoltke.\r\n\r\n=38= 6 =a la electricidad le da la gana=: 'electricity takes the\r\nnotion.' The subject of =da= is =gana=; cf. the plural form p. 82, l.\r\n11. This construction of =dar= is most common in expressions of desire,\r\nwhim, etc., with words like =gusto, ventolera=, and the like. The\r\nSpanish Academy says that =da la gana= is an uncultured colloquialism,\r\nbut does not object to this use of =dar= with other words.\r\n\r\n=38= 8 =los de Paris=: the Champs-Élysées, the central garden of Paris,\r\nis one of the most famous public squares in the world.\r\n\r\n=38= 13 =pisos=: lit. 'stories,' meaning the celestial spheres, whose\r\nnumber Dante, however, makes nine.\r\n\r\n=38= 14 =sino=: i.e. =nada sino, cosa sino=. R. 739; C. 232, 4.\r\n\r\n=38= 20 =está de cuerpo presente=: 'is laid out for its funeral.'\r\n\r\n=38= 28 =se han corrido=: 'have been issued'.\r\n\r\n=39= 7 =sulfurar=: colloq. expression, equivalent to Eng. 'get a rise\r\nout of.'\r\n\r\n=40= 1 =todo se acabó=: 'it's all over,' 'that's an end of it.'\r\nNoteworthy as an idiom is the use of the past absolute of =acabar=, and\r\noccasionally other verbs of ending or stopping, where the perfect would\r\nbe expected according to ordinary tense usage.\r\n\r\n=40= 7 =salimos con=: see =salir con= in vocabulary.\r\n\r\n=40= 13 =no podía menos de=: R. 1033; K. 619; C. 291.\r\n\r\n=40= 18 =al Ateneo=: 'to the Athenaeum,' a literary and scientific club\r\nin Madrid, established in 1835, which has been for many years the\r\nmeeting-place of Spanish liberals and freethinkers. It is looked upon\r\nwith great suspicion by the clerical party.\r\n\r\n=40= 30 =haciéndose la mosquita muerta=: 'playing possum,' 'lying low'\r\n(colloq.), feigning insignificance and biding his time.\r\n\r\n=40= 31 =los siete doctores=: as the mediaeval church had its seven\r\nsacraments, its seven cardinal virtues, its seven deadly sins, its seven\r\nsages of antiquity, etc., so it had its seven doctors, or divinely\r\nappointed teachers of the faith. The list of these last was a very\r\nvariable one.\r\n\r\n=40= 34 =Si=: the conditional =si= is idiomatically used to give point\r\nor emphasis to an affirmation, much like the English colloquial _why_.\r\nR. 1423; K. 601; C. 214, 4. Similarly on p. 43, l. 15. This usage must\r\nbe distinguished carefully from the similar use of the affirmative\r\nparticle =sí=, marking a real or implied antithesis.\r\n\r\n=41= 9 =ante=: R. 191; K. 632; C. 222.\r\n\r\n=41= 13 =diera=: really plup. ind., not imperf. subj. As is well known,\r\nthe forms in =-ara,-iera=, came from the Latin plup. ind. (Span. =amara=\r\n= Lat. _amaveram, amaram_), and in older Spanish retained in most cases\r\ntheir original force; but they were confused with the Latin imperf.\r\nsubj. in _-rem_, and gradually the subjunctive use supplanted the\r\nindicative. The latter, however, survives in relative clauses in formal\r\nor elevated discourse, and still more in colloquial idiom. Galdós uses\r\nit more than do most modern authors. Cf. R. 1202; K. 702; C. 280.\r\n\r\n=41= 22 =hieráticos=: a form of ancient Egyptian writing intermediate\r\nbetween hieroglyphic and demotic.\r\n\r\n=42= 34 =tomar el arado=: 'take the plough-handle.'--=sentarse al\r\ntelar=: 'sit down at the workbench' (lit. 'loom').\r\n\r\n=43= 9 =recién=: the adv. =recientemente=, when it immediately precedes\r\na past participle used adjectively, assumes this abbreviated form. R.\r\n1405; K. 600; C. 211, 2.\r\n\r\n=43= 20 =a macha martillo=: 'solidly' (though not elegantly). Colloquial\r\nfor that which is vigorously hammered together, though not a finely\r\nfinished piece of work.\r\n\r\n=44= 2 =vió ... el cielo abierto=: this phrase (from the New Testament)\r\nregularly means 'get an opportunity,' but here rather 'feel a great\r\ndeliverance.'\r\n\r\n=44= 28 =Toditos los días=: 'every single day.' Bello says that\r\n=todito=, =nadita=, are \"notable\" in that the diminutive form does not\r\nat all alter the meaning of =todo, nada=, but merely makes them\r\ncolloquial.\r\n\r\n=45= 2 =tresillo=: a game of cards similar to ombre.\r\n\r\n=45= 8 =pobre=: unaccented in translation, since it precedes the noun.\r\nHence omit the comma in translation.\r\n\r\n=45= 10 =borla de doctor=: 'doctor's tassel,' the most conspicuous\r\nornament of the gown worn by successful candidates for the degree of\r\ndoctor at the Spanish universities.\r\n\r\n=45= 11 =sacó nota de sobresaliente=: 'obtained the mark _excellent_ [or\r\n_distinguished_].'\r\n\r\n=46= 3 =unas maneras ... un modo ... una figura=: we have here a use of\r\n=uno= not noted in the grammars, yet common to all the Romance\r\nlanguages. It is often marked in conversation by a slight stress upon\r\nthe word; while in sense it at times merely indicates something\r\nnoteworthy or distinctive in the noun, at other times it approaches\r\nclosely the English 'such' in phrases like 'such a sight!'=--figura=:\r\n'style.'\r\n\r\n=46= 19 =entre tú y yo=: owing to its implication of reciprocal action,\r\nthe preposition =entre= when used with two pronominal objects inclines\r\nto take the nominative instead of the terminal forms after it. This\r\nusage probably arose from cases in which the form of the first object is\r\napparently nominative (though really terminal), such as =entre él y\r\nyo= or =entre mi padre y yo= (cf. R. 338), but has now extended itself\r\nto all cases.\r\n\r\n=46= 32 =sí que=: cf. n. on p. 40, l. 34. Also R. 1408; C. 214, 2.\r\n\r\n=47= 11 =os estáis=: R. 807.\r\n\r\n=48= 5 =inmigración fenicia=: the Phoenician settlements in Spain in\r\nprehistoric times have long been a favorite subject for the speculations\r\nof Spanish antiquaries.\r\n\r\n=48= 27 =los hombres de chispa=: 'you clever men.' For use of =los= cf.\r\nR. 324, 325; K. 189.\r\n\r\n=49= 17 =ya viene, ya está cerca=; que te quemas: phrases used in the\r\ngame of blindman's buff to indicate to the player that is blindfolded\r\nhis approach to the right person or place. For elliptical use of =que=\r\ncf. R. 1421; C. 214, 3.\r\n\r\n=50= 5 =Te quiero=: 'I have loved you.'\r\n\r\n=50= 18 =de picotazos=: this instrumental use of =de= with the verb\r\n=dar= is colloquially common.\r\n\r\n=51= 1 =no podía menos de=: R. 1033; K. 619; C. 291.\r\n\r\n=51= 9 =No es=, etc.: the advice is bad; Pepe is not speaking for the\r\ngarden's sake.\r\n\r\n=51= 17 =_Insere nunc_=, etc.: Vergil, _Ecl._ I, 73. It is to be noted\r\nthat the good priest's translation of _pone ordine_ (=arregla=, 'set in\r\norder,' 'attend to') is not very accurate. The phrase means, of course,\r\n'plant in rows.'\r\n\r\n=52= 9 =al crecer=: 'as it grew.'\r\n\r\n=52= 11 =pero=: 'an out;' the conjunction 'but,' used substantively.\r\n\r\n=52= 31 =Concilio de Trento=: this council of the Church (1545-1563)\r\nreasserted most positively the principle of the celibacy of the clergy.\r\n\r\n=53= 32 =_Nec vero terrae_=, etc.: Vergil, _Georg._ II, 109.\r\n\r\n=54= 3 =_Ille horridus alter_=, etc.: Vergil, _Georg._ IV, 93-94.\r\n\r\n=54= 17 =le ha dado por=: 'the whim has taken him.' Cf. n. on p. 38, l.\r\n6.\r\n\r\n=54= 19 =Flammarión=: French popular writer on astronomy, Camille\r\nFlammarion.\r\n\r\n=55= 9 =no debe sentirse=: 'it cannot be taken ill.'\r\n\r\n=55= 11 =Bismarck=: in 1876, when _Doña Perfecta_ was published,\r\nBismarck was just coming to the end of the so-called _Kulturkampf_, the\r\nstruggle with the Church in which he imprisoned bishops, closed\r\nchurches, and took other extreme measures to browbeat the Catholics into\r\nsubmission. Hence the priest's feeling toward him.\r\n\r\n=55= 21 =Bufos=: name of an objectionable variety show in Madrid just\r\nthen. It was suppressed a little later.\r\n\r\n=56= 1 =mereceré=: R. 1195; K.703,_c_; C. 266.\r\n\r\n=56= 19 =Si=: cf. n. on p. 40, l. 34.\r\n\r\n=57= 16 =Adelantado=: in ancient times a high official of the realm, who\r\nacted as governor of a frontier province, president or lord high justice\r\nof part of the kingdom, and the like. In this case, some local celebrity\r\nof this rank who happened to be buried in the cathedral.\r\n\r\n=58= 4 =disgusto=: not 'disgust.'\r\n\r\n=58= 8 =a ello=: R. 1360.\r\n\r\n=59= 22 =Ténganme=: sc. =ustedes=.\r\n\r\n=60= 4 =_Est Deus in nobis_=: Ovid (_A.A._ III, 549; _Fasti_ VI, 5) thus\r\ndescribes the inspired poet. The Renaissance was fond of the quotation.\r\nThe capital D is doubtless meant to indicate the priest's monotheistic\r\napplication of the words; yet many old editions of the Latin classics\r\ncapitalize _Deus_ even when referring to heathen gods.\r\n\r\n=60= 16 =ábside, coro= ('choir'): parts of the cathedral.\r\n\r\n=60= 32 =quincallería=: properly a shop or stall for the sale of\r\n=quincalla=, which the Academy defines as \"metal articles, mainly cheap,\r\nas scissors, thimbles, imitation jewelry.\"\r\n\r\n=61= 11 =iconoclastas=: \"a breaker or destroyer of images; a person\r\nconspicuously hostile to the use of images in Christian worship,\" says\r\nthe Century Dictionary. Jacintito uses the word in the latter sense,\r\nwhich is the theological and dictionary definition in Spain; Pepe in the\r\nformer, the etymological and international sense.\r\n\r\n=61= 29 =qué=: 'how far.'\r\n\r\n=61= 32 =_La Traviata_=: opera by Verdi.\r\n\r\n=62= 2 =_La Gran Duquesa_=: the comic opera _La Grande Duchesse_, by\r\nOffenbach.\r\n\r\n=62= 34 =de=: 'to.'\r\n\r\n=63= 27 =zarzuela=: light dramatic performance peculiar to Spain, partly\r\nrecited and partly sung.\r\n\r\n=64= 1 =Si no=: elliptical expression very common in colloquial Spanish,\r\n'otherwise,' 'if you don't think so.'\r\n\r\n=64= 20 =alguno=: i.e. =negocio=.\r\n\r\n=64= 23 =papel sellado=: legal documents are required to bear a revenue\r\nstamp.\r\n\r\n=65= 10 =tejares=: 'brickyards,' where tiles (=tejas=), sun-dried bricks\r\n(=adobes=), and burnt bricks (=ladrillos=) are made.\r\n\r\n=65= 16 =superior=: i.e. higher up the stream.\r\n\r\n=65= 23 =linderos=: cf. n. on p. 7, l. 6.\r\n\r\n=66= 1 =Caco=: 'Cacus,' robber giant, son of Vulcan, who lived in a cave\r\nof the Aventine Hill, and who was killed by Hercules for stealing from\r\nhim the oxen of Geryon (cf. Vergil, _Aen._ VIII, 193 ff.).\r\n\r\n=66= 5 =prescripción=: by Justinian's code, twenty years' adverse\r\npossession of an absent person's real estate makes the occupant the\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n=66= 9 =lo que es eso=: 'as for that.'\r\n\r\n=66= 13 =juicio de conciliación=: 'reconciliation hearing.' The Spanish\r\nlaw requires that before actual trial of a civil cause the parties shall\r\ntry, in open court, to arrive at a friendly settlement of their\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n=67= 6 =No vale la pena=: 'it's not worth while,' vague phrase used in\r\npolitely deprecating an apology (Fr. _ce n'est pas la peine_).\r\n\r\n=68= 11 =pegan la hebra=: 'get the thread tied' (get started in\r\nchatting).\r\n\r\n=68= 31 =_Madrid_=: the pronunciation of final =d= like =z= (Eng. _th_\r\nin _teeth_) is either provincialism or affectation. It is the single\r\npoint on which the pronunciation of well-bred Castilians is not accepted\r\nas standard.\r\n\r\n=68= 34 =muy relacionada en la Corte=: 'widely acquainted at the\r\ncapital.'\r\n\r\n=69= 4 =Muley-Abbas=: Moorish prince, brother of the Emperor of Morocco,\r\nwho visited Spain soon after the war between Spain and Morocco\r\n(1859-1860) was ended.\r\n\r\n=69= 7 =el 60=: i.e. =el año 1860=.\r\n\r\n=69= 10 =morería=: this quaint word is common in the Spanish popular\r\nballads (=romances=) both for the land of the Moors and for the Moors\r\nthemselves. Galdós uses it, of course, with a touch of humor.\r\n\r\n=69= 13 =que se salía=, etc.: (seemingly) 'bursting out of himself\r\nthrough being too big to go in his own skin.'\r\n\r\n=69= 15 =Procedía=, etc.: 'he was a product of the exclaustration'; i.e.\r\na monk who had turned priest at the time of the confiscation of the\r\nmonasteries by the Spanish government (1835).\r\n\r\n=69= 24 =la Fama=, etc.: cf. Vergil, _Aen._ IV, 174 ff.\r\n\r\n=69= 33 =vacía=: that is, owing to the removal of his great bulk.\r\n\r\n=70= 10 =Por más que=: R. 899.\r\n\r\n=70= 23 =_Augusto Nicolás_=: imaginary author or book.\r\n\r\n=70= 25 =que pareces=: ellipsis for =tan cargado que pareces=.\r\n\r\n=70= 34 =_Concilios_=: there are four or five voluminous histories of\r\nthe councils of the Church, with the texts of their decisions; the title\r\nis _Collection of Councils_, with variations.

The Madrid edition has here\r\n=explotar=, 'exploit,' which makes sense, but a less satisfactory sense.\r\n\r\n=75= 6 =como no sea=: 'unless it be.'\r\n\r\n=75= 9 =Nicolasito Hernández=: the tall-hatted money-lender of p. 92.\r\nThe Madrid edition reads =Nicolasita= here.\r\n\r\n=75= 21 =A que=: elliptical phrase, derived from expressions like\r\n=apuesto a que=, 'I wager that.'\r\n\r\n=75= 22 =dejaron bizcos=: 'made cross-eyed' (with astonishment and\r\nenvy). Since the London Exhibition of 1862 there had been those of\r\nParis, 1867, and Vienna, 1873. By not mentioning these the Orbajosans of\r\n1875 practically confess that they had never been able to repeat their\r\nsuccess of thirteen years ago.\r\n\r\n=76= 8 =que=: the double syntax of this word, as accusative with\r\n=celebró= and nominative with =fué=, is a grammatical fault.\r\n\r\n=76= 26 =fulminante=: medical men in our country use \"fulminant,\"\r\n\"fulminating,\" or \"foudroyant,\" in the same sense.\r\n\r\n=76= 30 =regular porción=: 'a good big lot' (colloq.).\r\n\r\n=76= 31 =fuese=: from =ir=, not from =ser=.

The legend of Don Juan, so famous in\r\nEuropean literature by reason of Molière's play (_Le festin de Pierre_),\r\nByron's poem (which uses, however, hardly more than the name), and\r\nMozart's opera (_Don Giovanni_), originated in Spain. The hero of it is\r\nthere represented to have been a Sevillan of illustrious family, Don\r\nJuan Tenorio by name. The story first appears in a Franciscan chronicle\r\nof Seville, written in the 16th century. It then attracted the attention\r\nof the great Spanish dramatists of the end of the 16th and beginning of\r\nthe 17th century. The first complete use of it for literary purposes was\r\nby Tirso de Molina (whose true name was Gabriel Téllez), in his play _El\r\nBurlador de Sevilla y el Convidado de Piedra_.\r\n\r\n=87= 5 =Estado Mayor de Plazas=: body of staff officers charged with the\r\nsupervision of forts or strongholds (Fr. _état-major des places_).\r\n\r\n=87= 6 =el 54=: in July, 1854, the main army being in the south fighting\r\ninsurgents, the populace of Madrid defeated the soldiery in a bloody\r\nstreet battle of three days, and turned the government out of office.\r\n\r\n=87= 15 =serán=: cf.

Translate 'you probably took,' 'no\r\ndoubt you took,' or the like.\r\n\r\n=98= 8 =Todo lo he meditado=: cf. n. on p. 32, l. 17.\r\n\r\n=98= 19 =extremeño=: native of the province of Estremadura (spelled in\r\nSpanish =Extremadura=; but cf. n. on p. 22, l. 25, and p. 102, l. 27).\r\nIn small Spanish towns, shopkeepers and the like from other provinces\r\nare commonly designated in brief in this way rather than by their names.\r\n\r\n=99= 33 =Por poco más le dejan=, etc.: 'a little more and they had left\r\nhim [dead] on the spot.'

Don Cayetano is\r\nreading from a different note.\r\n\r\n=110= 8 =Mateo Díaz Coronel=: imaginary author of an imaginary book.\r\n\r\n=110= 22 =recibiera=: cf. n. on p. 41, l. 13. The force of the tense is\r\nhere, however, rather perfect than pluperfect. Such use is not rare.\r\n\r\n=112= 2 =ensimismado=: 'wrapt in his own thoughts' (from =en sí mismo=).\r\n--=lo ve todo=: 'sees everything.' Cf. n. on p. 32, l. 17.\r\n\r\n=112= 21 =consonante=: the gender (agreeing with =letra= understood)\r\nshows that the word here means 'consonant' (the letter _s_), not\r\n'accord.'\r\n\r\n=113= 16 =que tanteaban=: 'feeling their way.'\r\n\r\n=113= 27 =escalón=: i.e. the =peldaño= mentioned above.\r\n\r\n=114= 7 =Daba diente con diente=: 'her teeth chattered.'\r\n\r\n=114= 24 =Tentando=: 'feeling along.'\r\n\r\n=115= 30 =Que si creo=: this (cf. R. 1421) would be the obvious Spanish\r\nway to express a surprised exclamation 'Whether I believe in God!' But\r\nsome good grammarians prefer to explain such a =que si= on the principle\r\nof the note on p. 40, l. 34.\r\n\r\n=117= 11 =es ley=, etc.: 'it's the rule not to oppose directly.'\r\n\r\n=118= 12 =vernos las caras=: 'see each other's faces.' Cf.

Old Testament saints\r\nwere kept in Limbo till the death of Christ, then taken to heaven.\r\n\r\n=110= 24 =fascinada=: this word properly belongs to the superstition of\r\nthe evil eye, and expresses the bad luck or sickness which one suffers\r\nin consequence of having fallen under such a glance. Note the word\r\n=ojos= below. In untechnical use it corresponds to a loose popular use\r\nof the word 'hypnotized.'\r\n\r\n=118= 29 =fueras=: from =ir=, not =ser=.\r\n\r\n=120= 13 =sea=: 'shall be.' The subjunctive, in spite of depending on\r\nthe present tense =juro=, has here a future sense because of its\r\nrelation to the future thought involved in her prayer; such seems to be\r\nthe safest explanation of this difficult passage.\r\n\r\n=121= 6 =Volvió a sentarse=: R. 1187; K. 725,_a_; C. 107, 5.\r\n\r\n=121= 19 =Recobrado el sentido=: R. 1228, 2; K. 741; C. 276, 5.\r\n\r\n=122= 14 =_allá voy_=: 'here I come.' The verb =ir=, not =venir=, is\r\nused in answering a call (Eng. _I'm coming_ = =voy=). =Allá= is not\r\n'here,' but 'here I come' is the idiomatic equivalent of the phrase as a\r\nwhole; besides, somewhat of the beat of the accents must here be kept in\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\n=123= 16 =Anticipo forzoso tenemos=: 'they are forcing our hand.'\r\n\r\n=123= 20 =Si=: the conclusion from this 'if' is concealed in the\r\nsuspensive points at the end of the sentence.\r\n\r\n=124= 6 =o sea=: 'that is to say' (lit.

With the disappearance of the\r\ninstitution from actual life its reputation as a hotbed of uncertainty\r\nand contention grew all the stronger, and the word is used to-day to\r\nmean 'anarchy' (in a loose sense) or 'turmoil.'\r\n\r\n=125= 12 =_Gestas_=: italic because the word, like English 'gest,' is\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\n=125= 19 =cuando los Apostólicos=: 'at the time of the Apostolics,' a\r\nreactionary faction that undertook to get possession of the state in the\r\nlast years of the reign of Ferdinand VII (1814-1833).

The antiquated form =do=,\r\ndoublet of =donde=, is now preserved only in phrases in which it is\r\nfollowed by =quiera=, and in a few locutions like =a dó=, 'whither.'\r\n\r\n=126= 15 =municipio=: 'city authorities.'\r\n\r\n=126= 33 =caben=: R. 1155; K. 529, _a_; C. 284.\r\n\r\n=127= 18 =entre tú y yo=: cf. n. on p. 46, l. 19.\r\n\r\n=128= 11 =dar la dirección a los globos=: before the development of\r\naviation, to give steering power to balloons was one of the perennial\r\nenterprises of the most wildly ambitious type of inventors.\r\n\r\n=128= 23 =me pican=: 'bite' (of mustard, garlic, etc.).\r\n\r\n=129= 5 =periódico suelto=: 'irregular periodical' (hence appearing when\r\nand where least expected). The most familiar type of irregular\r\nperiodical in the Spanish-speaking world is the revolutionary sheet\r\n(to-day usually anarchistic) which is driven to the announcement\r\n\"Aparece cuando puede\" by the double pressure of poverty and\r\ngovernmental hostility.\r\n\r\n=129= 20 =perezca=, etc.: 'die and be born again.'\r\n\r\n=129= 25 =en 1848=: cf. n. on p. 125, l. 20.\r\n\r\n=129= 26 =en puertas=: i.e. on police duty.\r\n\r\n=130= 3 =maldición de Dios=: cf. \"=ser bendición de Dios= (figurative\r\nand colloquial phrase) be very abundant\", Academy.\r\n\r\n=130= 16 =de qué pie cojea=: i.e. what really ails it.\r\n\r\n=130= 19 =ello es=: R. 302; K. 188, _a_; C. 206, 2.\r\n\r\n=131= 2 =Cómo se van atando cabos=: lit.

Cf. vocabulary under\r\n=atar=.\r\n\r\n=131= 20 =sueltas=: 'from time to time,' 'now and then' (lit.\r\n'disconnected').\r\n\r\n=131= 23 =desperezándose=: the Academy defines this as stretching and\r\ntwisting in order to shake off either =pereza= (in the sense \"repugnance\r\nto rising from one's bed or seat\") or the numbness of a sleepy limb.\r\n\r\n=131= 31 =ya no se estilan=: 'are no longer good form.'\r\n\r\n=132= 14 =Al mirar=: 'when she looked.'\r\n\r\n=133= 5 =pára=: from =parar=.\r\n\r\n=133= 19 =cinco=: the Madrid edition has =cincos=.\r\n\r\n=136= 18 =te confieso=, etc.: 'confess to you--Yes, I have indeed,' etc.\r\n\r\n=136= 25 =cada vez=: 'all the time.'\r\n\r\n=136= 28 =bríos=: 'spirit.'\r\n\r\n=138= 22 =Que se acabó todo=: 'it's all over.'

Cf. p.\r\n124, l. 21.\r\n\r\n=144= 10 =a partir un confite=: 'hail-fellow-well-met.' The dictionary\r\nsays: \"=morder en un confite=, of two or more persons, have great\r\nfriendship or intimacy\"; \"=estar a partir un piñón con=, be entirely at\r\none with.\"\r\n\r\n=145= 17 =un infeliz=: this term \"always holds in solution a grain of\r\nmadness, or, what is perhaps worse, of helplessness akin to idiocy\"\r\n(Knapp).\r\n\r\n=145= 30 =Allan Cardec=: the French author Hippolyte-Léon-Denizard\r\nRivail (1803-1869), better known by his pseudonym Allan Kardec, whose\r\nworks on spiritualism made a great sensation in the middle of the\r\ncentury, and contributed much to the diffusion of the belief both in\r\nEurope and in America.\r\n\r\n=147= 20 =corregidor=: a magistrate appointed by the government of Spain\r\nto govern a district or municipality. He has much greater power than an\r\n=alcalde=, or mayor, and is responsible to the central administration\r\nalone.

X and XVI of Rivadeneyra's _Biblioteca de Autores Españoles_).\r\n\r\n=150= 15 =recibiera=: cf. n. on p. 41, l. 13.\r\n\r\n=150= 22 =partiendo un piñón=: 'hobnobbing'; cf. n. on p. 144, l. 10.\r\nThe =piñón=, the seed found in the cone of the stone pine, is a very\r\nsmall but pleasant nut.\r\n\r\n=150= 31 =Brumario=: 'Brumaire,' an autumn month of the French\r\nrevolutionary calendar.

The Cid (often called also Campeador, 'champion')\r\nis the chief of the popular national heroes of Spain. His true name was\r\nRodrigo Díaz de Bivar. His exploits against both Christians and Moslems\r\nmade him a marked figure even in his own time, and shortly after his\r\ndeath in the year 1099 he became one of the favorite subjects of popular\r\npoetry. He is the hero of one of the earliest and most famous monuments\r\nof Spanish poetry, the _Poema del Cid_; the early chronicles give much\r\nspace to him, and he was sung in great numbers of popular ballads\r\n(=romances=).\r\n\r\n=153= 1 =capitular=: a member of a =cabildo=, which is the body of\r\n=canónigos=; hence, practically a synonym of =canónigo=.\r\n\r\n=153= 8 =después de deshonrado=: R. 1233; K. 742; C. 276, 7.\r\n\r\n=153= 15 =por aquello de que tiene uno=: 'by reason of the fact that one\r\nhas.' A peculiarity of the Spanish use of =uno=, 'one,' well illustrated\r\nby this example, is that there is a feeling against employing it except\r\nwith reference to the speaker himself. Thus the general and\r\nindeterminate 'one,' 'they,' 'people,' Fr. _on_, is rendered by the\r\nreflexive or by the third person plural of the verb; but when the\r\nspeaker for any reason desires to generalize himself, so to speak, he\r\nemploys =uno=.\r\n\r\n=153= 16 =que si no=: 'otherwise.' Cf. n. on p. 64, l. 1.\r\n\r\n=154= 5 =amanezcamos ... asesinadas=: 'may be found in the morning\r\nmurdered.'\r\n\r\n=154= 11 =menos=: a comparative has superlative force whenever this\r\nsuits the sense, whether the article is used or not.\r\n\r\n=155= 22 =por el hilo se saca el ovillo=: 'by the thread the skein is\r\npulled out,' proverbial phrase implying that a small indication will\r\nenable one to get at the whole of a thing.\r\n\r\n=155= 23 =por la uña el león=: identical with the Latin proverb _ex\r\nungue leonem_.\r\n\r\n=155= 33 =cuatro soldados y un cabo=: i.e. an insignificant force.\r\n\r\n=156= 4 =Por vida de!...=: cf. n. on p. 14, l. 9.\r\n\r\n=156= 13 =echártela=: for =la= cf. n. on p. 7, l. 16.\r\n\r\n=156= 24 =echarse fuera=: 'burst forth.'\r\n\r\n=157= 26 =de=: cf.

'I don't\r\nbargain to take the profit off their hands.' See vocabulary.\r\n\r\n=165= 3 =que pudierais=: the antecedent of =que= is =mancha=. Earlier\r\nMadrid editions have =que= not here but before =por causa=; later\r\neditions, as in our text.\r\n\r\n=165= 8 =lo, lo=: omit in translation, and express the verbs merely by\r\n'it did,' 'will it'; or else translate the first =lo= by 'so.'\r\n\r\n=165= 11 =en buen hora=: cf. n. on p. 35, l. 26.\r\n\r\n=166= 1 =más mundo=: 'more people.'

Roldán is the French Roland (called in\r\nthe Italian forms of his story Orlando), and Renialdos is the hero\r\ncalled in the French _chansons de geste_ Renaut de Montauban (in\r\nItalian, Rinaldo da Montalbano). The present ballad appears in both the\r\noldest existing collections of Spanish ballads, printed the one in 1550\r\nand the other slightly earlier (it bears no date). The poem relates how\r\nRenialdos (or Reinaldos), having fallen into the hands of his feudal\r\nlord and unforgiving enemy, the Emperor Charlemagne, is about to be put\r\nto death, when Charlemagne's nephew Roldán (Roland) rides up and\r\nviolently interposes in the prisoner's behalf. The Emperor yields on\r\ncondition that Renialdos shall leave France forever. This the hero\r\npromises to do, and makes his way to the land of the Great Khan, who\r\nreceives him warmly and offers to aid him against Charlemagne. Renialdos\r\nrefuses, however, to make war upon his liege lord, even though wronged\r\nby him. Then the Khan furnishes him with men to conquer the Emperor of\r\nTrebizond and to establish himself in his place. The story of the\r\nbanishment of Renialdos is not told in this form in the splendid old\r\nFrench poem (_chanson de geste_) entitled _Renaut de Montauban_, but is\r\nan Italianized version containing elements not truly popular and\r\ntraditional. The Spanish ballad, too, is in some other respects not\r\nthoroughly popular in its character. Nevertheless, it is written in the\r\ntraditional ballad style, and is very fine and spirited. It is printed\r\nin full in Durán, _Romancero General_, Vol. I, p. 240; and in Wolf y\r\nHofmann, _Primavera y Flor de Romances_, Vol. II, p. 346.\r\n\r\n=167= 5 =Briador=: in the old French poems (_Chanson de Roland_, etc.)\r\nRoland's horse is called Veillantif; but the Italian poets Boiardo (in\r\nthe _Orlando Innamorato_) and Ariosto (in the _Orlando Furioso_) call\r\nhim Brigliadoro (= _briglia d'oro_, 'bridle of gold'). Pulci, however,\r\nin the _Mergante Maggiore_, but slightly modifies the French name,\r\nmaking it Vegliantin. The Spanish =Briador= is a corruption of\r\nBrigliadoro.\r\n\r\n=167= 7 =Durlindana=: the name of Roland's sword. In the French poems\r\nthe word is Durendal. We have here again the Italianized form.\r\n\r\n=167= 9 =entena=: the yard of a lateen sail, much longer and\r\nconsequently also stouter than the yard (=verga=) of a square-rigged\r\nship.\r\n\r\n=167= 18 =como D. Renialdos=: in the ballad it is Roldán, not Renialdos,\r\nthat pronounces the following lines. None the less, the readiness of the\r\npeasant to go on with the quotation is very true to life. The average\r\nSpaniard of the lower classes is perfectly familiar with large numbers\r\nof these old popular poems.\r\n\r\n=167= 20 =ser bien librado=: in the sense of the intransitive =librar=.\r\n\r\n=168= 4 =Vaya=: R. 1429; K. 659,_a_; C. 237, 6.--=unos=: cf. n. on p.\r\n46, l. 3.\r\n\r\n=169= 1 =Válgame=, etc.: cf. R. 1427; K. 658,_d_; C. 237, 1; and p. 62,\r\nl. 27.\r\n\r\n=169= 12 =que decía=: 'saying'; lit. probably 'who' rather than 'which.'\r\n\r\n=169= 13 =Ya pareció=: after =ya= the past absolute is commonly used\r\nwhere ordinary tense usage would require the perfect. The suddenness or\r\ncompleteness of a past action is thus emphasized. Cf. n. on p. 40, l. 1.\r\n\r\n=169= 23 =esa=: R. 442; K. 265; C. 162, 2.\r\n\r\n=170= 9 =dice=: the tense of this, as of several other verbs in the\r\nparagraph, is present, after the manner of legal depositions.\r\n\r\n=170= 17 =entregara=: for tense cf. n. on p. 110, l. 22.\r\n\r\n=170= 10 saldría=: for tense cf. n. on p. 3, l. 17.\r\n\r\n=170= 20 =sin tapujos=: 'unmuffled.' The Spanish =capa=, thrown round\r\nthe neck and face as well as the body, is an unrivaled means of\r\ndisguise. It is a point of Spanish courtesy, when wearing the =capa=, to\r\nunmuffle (=desembozarse=) before addressing any one.\r\n\r\n=171= 13 =se hizo sangre=: 'drew blood' (se = on herself).\r\n\r\n=171= 17 =patético: not 'pathetic.'\r\n\r\n=171= 20 =inmenso=: cf. the Academy's definition \"=no caber el corazón\r\nen el pecho=, be so wrought up by some occasion of grief or anger that\r\nit cannot get relief or quiet,\" and, since Arabic has affected Spanish\r\nso much, the Arabic phrase \"his breast is narrow\" to express the same\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n=171= 24 =Entre tanto=: this ought to mean while the conversations of\r\npp. 170-171 were going on; and this is doubtless the meaning, however\r\ndifficult it may be to reconcile this with =dormía o aparentaba dormir=\r\non the next page.\r\n\r\n=172= 15 =rezar=: properly this means reciting the prescribed prayers of\r\nthe Church (so that Protestants prefer to say =orar=); otherwise here.\r\n\r\n=173= 1 =tan sólo=: 'merely,' 'and nothing more.'\r\n\r\n=173= 6 =dicha=: noun.--=conciliarlo todo=: cf. n. on p. 32, l. 17.\r\n\r\n=173= 19 =que no movía=: elliptical for =de manera que=, etc., or the\r\nlike, equivalent to an English participle construction, 'not moving a\r\nfoot,' etc.\r\n\r\n=173= 27 =expectativa=: Madrid edition =espectativa=, cf. n. on p. 102,\r\nl. 27.\r\n\r\n=173= 32 =extraño=: the dream, which thus far had been fairly faithful\r\nmemory, begins from this point onward to mix dream-fancies with facts.\r\n\r\n=173= 34 =recortada=: this word is applied to the \"cut\" or lobed leaves\r\nof plants and trees; also to silhouettes cut out of paper.\r\n\r\n=175= 12 =_Agnus Dei_=: a common object of household adoration in\r\nCatholic countries, consisting of a flat piece of wax on which is\r\nstamped the figure of a lamb supporting the cross, or of some saint.\r\nThese tokens are blessed by the Pope in large numbers, generally every\r\nseventh year, and distributed among Catholics. The possession of one is\r\nsupposed to be a protection against misfortune.\r\n\r\n=175= 13 =rizada=: Palm Sunday in Spain has two kinds of palms, both\r\nalike blessed: the simple natural bits of palm-leaf, and those which are\r\n=rizadas=, i.e. frilled and crimped into all sorts of ornamental shapes\r\nwith a view to using them as decorations.\r\n\r\n=175= 14 =flores de trapo=: 'artificial flowers' (lit. 'of cloth').\r\n\r\n=175= 18 =narigudo=: such was the meaning of Ovid's surname, Naso. There\r\nis perhaps also a reminiscence of the secondary meaning of Lat.\r\n_nasutus_, 'witty,' 'clever.'\r\n\r\n=175= 19 =conceptista=: the =conceptista= style in Spanish literature is\r\nthat style of which Quevedo was the most eminent master. See cyclopedias\r\nunder \"Quevedo\" and under \"Spanish Literature.\"\r\n\r\n=175= 24 =dando vueltas=, etc.: Aulus Gellius (_Noct. Att._ III, 3, 14)\r\nsays that Varro and other older authorities related how Flautus, after\r\nmaking some money by the stage, lost it all in trade, and was obliged to\r\nhire himself to a baker in Rome, being put to turn a hand-mill (_mola\r\ntrusatilis_). Of the plays mentioned by Aulus Gellius as written by\r\nPlautus under these circumstances, however, none is preserved.\r\n\r\n=175= 26 =pícaro=: several unsavory tales about Sallust were current in\r\nantiquity, and his political conduct was far from being above suspicion.\r\n\r\n=175= 30 =Rutilio=: the anti-Christian poet Rutilius Claudius\r\nNamatianus, who has left us a poem entitled _De reditu sito_, describing\r\na journey made by him in 416 A. D. from Rome to his home in Gaul.\r\n\r\n=176= 6 =las cabras=, etc.: in most Spanish towns the milkman (or more\r\noften milkwoman) drives a flock of she-goats through the streets,\r\nmilking at the door of each customer the amount required.\r\n\r\n=176= 18 =las=: the =misas=.\r\n\r\n=176= 29 =conforme=: 'just as.'\r\n\r\n=177= 11 =Nada, nada=: 'well, well.' Cf. n. on p. 31, l. 23.\r\n\r\n=177= 30 =justiciada=: not given in the dictionaries; a noun in\r\nparticipial form from =justicia=, like =cuchillada= from =cuchillo,\r\nlanzada= from =lanza, calaverada= from =calavera=. K. 765, rem. 2; C.\r\n132, 4, _b_.\r\n\r\n=177= 32 =llamarles y decirles=: for imper. use of infin. cf. R. 1225;\r\nK. 731; C. 277, 5.\r\n\r\n=178= 16 =amigotes=: the coloring given by Spanish augmentatives and\r\ndiminutives is well brought out by the contrast between this word and\r\n=amiguito= in line 1 above.\r\n\r\n=178= 22 =sentar=: the infinitive has something of imperative coloring\r\n(cf. p. 177, l. 32, and n.), but inclines decidedly to the usage known\r\nas the historical, or continuative, infinitive.\r\n\r\n=179= 17 =quien=: 'anybody who' (woman).--=no siendo sacerdote=: 'unless\r\nhe is a priest.'\r\n\r\n=179= 23 =de mí=: R. 1440, _q_; C. 128, 3, _a_; 237, 8.\r\n\r\n=180= 1 =Vuelta a=: this idiom expresses impatience at repetition.\r\n\r\n=180= 6 =dos dedos de frente=: 'any sense' (lit.' two inches of\r\nforehead').\r\n\r\n=180= 14 =porque=: 'in order that.'\r\n\r\n=180= 18 =Será=: R. 1195; K. 703, _c_; C. 266. The form =hará= below is\r\nmore difficult; the force of the future there is presumably either 'why\r\nis it that God apparently makes me' or 'what do you suppose God makes me\r\nso silly for,' 'what can God be after in making me,' etc.\r\n\r\n=182= 28 =Falta=: verb, lit. 'is lacking'; i.e., 'you do not say that\r\nthey....' 'I guess they did not....'\r\n\r\n=182= 31 =ademanes encomiados=: 'an air of approbation.'\r\n\r\n=183= 5 =refiriendo=: 'while relating.'\r\n\r\n=183= 23 =unos humos=: 'such airs!' For use of =unos= cf. n. on p. 46,\r\nl. 3.\r\n\r\n=185= 6 =acabó de encender=: 'finished kindling.'\r\n\r\n=185= 24 =Valido=: in the same sense as =valiéndose=, line 15. Note both\r\nthe absence of any past sense and the fact that the past participle\r\ndrops the reflexive pronoun. Cf. C. 276, 4.\r\n\r\n=185= 32 =recibiera=: cf. n. on p. 41, l. 13.\r\n\r\n=186= 25 =por cuya razón=: cf. n. on p. 24, l. 7.\r\n\r\n=186= 27 =sin perjuicio de=: 'without prejudice in regard to' (legal\r\nphrase, indicating that a given action is not to annul or diminish the\r\nright of one party to demand a further accounting from the other).\r\n\r\n=187= 2 =las=: cf. n. on p. 7, l. 16.\r\n\r\n=187= 6 =pues=: 'since.'\r\n\r\n=187= 9 =Sacramento=: the capital S suggests that we take this word in\r\nits special sense defined by the Academy as \"Christ sacramented in the\r\nHost,\" so that our phrase would mean 'by having the power to work the\r\nmiracle of transubstantiation'; if the word here means his ordination as\r\npriest, which is one of the seven sacraments of the Church, the capital\r\nS is probably a misprint.\r\n\r\n=187= 19 =por lo muy santo y noble=: cf. R. 1358; K. 671; C. 125,_a_;\r\nhere =que es= is lacking, as is often the case after =por=.\r\n\r\n=188= 20 =consejero áulico=: the Aulic Council, 1500-1806 A.D., was the\r\nEmperor's supreme personal council, whose members all held office till\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\n=188= 31 =el más allá=: 'the beyond.'\r\n\r\n=189= 9 =cinco días=: the chronology is not clear. Comparison of p. 183,\r\nll. 12-14, and p. 186, ll. 20-24, with p. 208, ll. 18-20, shows that the\r\nletter dated April 14 (p. 207) cannot have been written till at least\r\nthe day after Caballuco's coming to the priest's house (p. 184); indeed,\r\nby p. 208, ll. 20-21, it would seem that the letter was a day or two\r\nlater. The progress of the story will show that the letter dated April\r\n20 (p. 209) cannot have been written later than the evening at which we\r\nhave now arrived.\r\n\r\n=190= 14 =cuanto en lo humano cabía=: 'that lay in human power.' Cf. R.\r\n1155; K. 529,_b_; C. 284.\r\n\r\n=190= 28 =con lo que sale usted=: lit. 'what you are coming out with.'\r\n\r\n=190= 29 =se están luciendo=: 'are showing themselves off' (cf. =lucir\r\nun nuevo paraguas= = 'to sport a new umbrella').\r\n\r\n=191= 4 =No asustarse=: imperative use of infinitive. R. 1225; K. 731;\r\nC.277, 5.\r\n\r\n=191= 7 =como el rascar=: i.e., to do a little of it makes you want to\r\ndo more.\r\n\r\n=191= 27 =refregones en los morros=: in Spain, 'rubs across the lips'\r\n(as if cleansing them) are, like spanking (=azotes=), a standard\r\npunishment for naughty words from a little child.\r\n\r\n=192= 2 =soberbia=: adjective.\r\n\r\n=192= 12 =la Encomienda=: this word means generally a piece of property\r\nbestowed upon a knight of one of the military orders; here, a particular\r\nestate of this kind that had sometime come into the possession of the\r\nPolentinos family.\r\n\r\n=193= 15 =Juan Lanas=: traditional name for a simpleton.\r\n\r\n=193= 26 =allá se le va=: 'are about the same as she,' 'are taking the\r\nsame line.'\r\n\r\n=193= 33 =esto se lo lleva la trampa=: grammatically, =la trampa= is the\r\nsubject of the clause; =lo=, which repeats =esto=, is the object; =se=\r\nis the reflexive of interest, often used with =llevar=.\r\n\r\n=194= 22 =en buen hora=: cf. n. on p. 35, l. 26.\r\n\r\n=195= 5 =le dan=: cf. n. on p. 38, l. 6.\r\n\r\n=195= 11 =sonsonete llorón=: 'sarcastic whine.'\r\n\r\n=195= 25 =si=: cf. n. on p. 40, l. 34.\r\n\r\n=196= 8 =tenebrario=: properly a candlestick which is used during matins\r\nof the last three days of Holy Week. These matins are called in Spanish\r\n=tinieblas=. The light of the =tenebrario= is dimmed by placing it\r\nwithin a kind of shrine. The idea here, of course, is that obscurity is\r\npart of the family inheritance.\r\n\r\n=197= 18 =acabó de estrujarle=: 'gave him the last squeeze.'\r\n\r\n=198= 3 =suspirando a moco y baba=: 'sighing and snuffling.'\r\n\r\n=198= 15 =en un quítame allá esas pajas=: 'in a wink of your eye'\r\n(colloq.). The phrase means literally 'get those straws [trifles] out of\r\nmy way,' and implies the feeling that a thing can be done quickly and\r\neasily.\r\n\r\n=198= 27 =los juegos de manos son juegos de villanos=: the Spanish\r\nAcademy defines this proverb in about the sense given to it by Gase's\r\nFrench-English Dictionary, \"playing with the hands is bad manners, rough\r\nplay is low\"; but the priest here, quite legitimately, makes it mean\r\n\"physical force is a blackguard's way.\"\r\n\r\n=200= 12 =qui tenga visos=: 'that has the look.'\r\n\r\n=200= 27 =Como lo huelan los de tropa=: 'supposing the military get a\r\nsmell of it.' For conjugation of =oler= see grammars.\r\n\r\n=201= 4 =Guarde usted=: 'look out for.'\r\n\r\n=201= 16 =el salitre=, etc.: i.e. powder.\r\n\r\n=202= 6 =Si=: cf. n. on p. 40, l. 34.\r\n\r\n=202= 17 =ha perdido la chaveta=: 'have lost your wits.' =Chaveta=, or\r\nmore commonly =chabeta=, is properly a wedge or key used by blacksmiths\r\nor carpenters to unite and tie several pieces of metal or wood.\r\n\r\n=202= 31 =medio=: adverbial, i.e. to be followed by a hyphen in\r\nEnglish. Contrast =media=, adjectival, in the line above.\r\n\r\n=203= 2 =Para solfas=, etc.: 'drubbings by treachery are not what\r\nCristóbal Ramos is good for.'\r\n\r\n=203= 31 =si es empeño de usted=: 'if it is your particular wish.'\r\n\r\n=204= 4 =jofaina=: 'finger-bowl' here.\r\n\r\n=205= 6 =no tienen espera=: 'endure no stay.'\r\n\r\n=205= 21 =me tiene=: 'she has for me.'\r\n\r\n=208= 13 =quijotadas=: 'extravagances,' 'quixotic undertakings.' The\r\nword is formed from the name of Cervantes' hero.\r\n\r\n=209= 13 =Mi coalición=, etc.: 'my half-serious, half-jocular\r\ncoalition.'\r\n\r\n=210= 3 =Sentiré mucho que=: 'I shall be very sorry in case.'\r\n\r\n=210= 11 =y concluirá=: 'and end it shall,' or simply 'and it shall.'\r\n\r\n=211= 28 =Irá=: 'he must be going.'\r\n\r\n=212= 4 =el pueblo se acaba=: 'the town ends,' i.e. we are coming to the\r\nlast houses.\r\n\r\n=212= 21 =bruto=: 'an idiot.'\r\n\r\n=213= 11 =quinqué=: from the French manufacturer Quinquet, who first\r\nmade such lamps on a considerable scale. The inventor was a Swiss\r\nchemist and physicist named Argant or Argand (1755-1803); hence these\r\nlamps are generally known in English as Argand lamps.\r\n\r\n=213= 19 =acicalarse=: 'prinking.'\r\n\r\n=213= 25 =despejada=: 'open.'\r\n\r\n=214= 3 =allegados=: the Academy defines this word by =pariente=\r\n('relative,' the same word by which it defines =deudo=) and =parcial=;\r\nand it defines a colloquial figurative sense of =pariente= by \"allegado,\r\nsemejante o parecido.\"\r\n\r\n=215= 8 =un Limbo prematuro=: 'a Limbo before the time.' Cf. n. on p.\r\n118, l. 17.\r\n\r\n=215= 9 =cuidan bien=: this is normal Spanish for 'take good care,'\r\ndeclaratively. May it be a misprint of the Madrid edition for =cuiden\r\nbien=, to be interpreted 'let them take good care'? In that case the\r\norder of words would be hardly the most usual; but it is not easy\r\notherwise to reconcile the sentence with the general course of the\r\nthought in this passage.\r\n\r\n=218= 15 =veros=: 'to see each other.'\r\n\r\n=220= =un su amigo=: 'a friend of his.'\r\n\r\n=220= 5 =virtuosísimo=: this word is used in the sense of the Italian\r\n_virtuoso_, a connoisseur, an appreciative and successful collector. The\r\nending =-ísimo= is here not merely intensive but very nearly true\r\nsuperlative; not 'extremely' but 'supremely.'\r\n\r\n=220= 6 =emblema=: 'crest'; the word =crestón= appears to mean not the\r\nheraldic device but the part of the helmet over which the device rises.\r\n=Emblema= is defined as meaning a symbol accompanied by a motto.\r\n\r\n=220= 7 =rabillo=: this word must here mean a serif, but is probably not\r\na technical term.\r\n\r\n=222= 20 =le impondrá a usted=: 'will advise you.'\r\n\r\n=224= 23 =nos=: ethical dative. R. 323; K. 231; C. 204.\r\n\r\n=224= 26 =dude=: sc. =usted=, unless it is a misprint for =dudo=.\r\n\r\n=224= 31 =San Baudilio de Llobregat=: a small town, commonly called San\r\nBoy, on the river Llobregat. It is six miles west of Barcelona. A large\r\nand well-administered private insane asylum is situated there.\r\n\r\n=225= 5 =pliegos=: 'sheets' (sixteen pages each if the book is octavo).\r\n\r\n=225= 25 =Albricias, albricias=: 'joy, joy!' (lit. a reward paid to the\r\nbringer of good tidings).\r\n\r\n=226= 22 =acaparada=: 'monopolized,' 'beguiled.' This verb (from Fr.\r\n_accaparer_, to 'corner' a commodity in the market, to 'seize upon' a\r\nthing, to 'sway' voters by demagogic methods) was condemned as a\r\nGallicism in the middle of the nineteenth century, but is now fully\r\naccepted in Spanish. It must not be confounded with the older but\r\nprobably now less common verb =acaparrar=, whose meaning is entirely\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n=227= 9 =novenas=: periods of nine days given to devotion and prayer. In\r\nEnglish the word is pronounced with the English sounds of _e_ and\r\n_a_.--=manifiestos=: exposures of the Sacrament for the adoration of\r\nbelievers.\r\n\r\n=227= 15 =el duque de Osuna=: a nobleman of very illustrious family,\r\nSpanish viceroy of Naples in the reign of Philip III. The plot mentioned\r\nbelow was, according to the Venetians, a diabolical scheme entered into\r\nby the Duke of Osuna, the Marquis of Villafranca, and the Marquis of\r\nBedmar, all Spaniards of high rank engaged in the war of the Spanish\r\nkingdom in Italy against Duke Charles Emmanuel of Savoy, who was aided\r\nby the Venetians. The plan was said to have involved the surprise of\r\nVenice, the slaughter of its senate and nobles, and its reduction to a\r\nmere dependency of Spain. Spanish historians have denied the existence\r\nof any such plot; for all that, it has remained the most memorable thing\r\nconnected with the viceroyalty of the Duke of Osuna. Hence the irony of\r\nthe present reference to it.\r\n\r\n=227= 19 =Esto se acabó=: 'this story is finished.' Cf. n. on p. 40, l.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =VOCABULARY=\r\n\r\nThis vocabulary aims to be complete, except for such proper names as do\r\nnot appear to involve a play on words or a change of form in translation\r\ninto English. Superlatives in =-ísimo= are not given unless irregular,\r\nbut diminutives and augmentatives are given. Adverbs in =-mente= are\r\ngiven under their adjectives, and are not separately defined if the\r\ndefinition of the adjective sufficiently indicates their rendering.\r\nAdjectives and personal substantives which form regular feminines are\r\ngiven in the masculine form, with the masculine definitions only, so far\r\nas the feminine definitions can be inferred from these; thus, for =tía=\r\nlook under =tío=, and, finding the definition 'uncle,' render the\r\nfeminine by 'aunt.' This rule has been followed even where, as with\r\n=descalzo, matón=, the feminine is the only form found in our text.\r\nInfinitives used substantively, translatable by the English form in\r\n_-ing_, are not separately given. The participial form in =-nte= is\r\ngiven separately, but that in =-ndo= and the past participle are not\r\ngiven apart from their verbs if the verbs occur. Neither is the\r\nsubstantivized past participle, even such as =pecado=; but not so words\r\nwhich merely coincide with the participle in form, as =estado=. Words\r\nwhich take the accent mark merely to indicate interrogative or\r\nexclamatory use are given under the unaccented form, and the existence\r\nof an accented form is not mentioned if the English equivalent remains\r\nthe same. Irregular forms of verbs in Chapters I-III are separately\r\ngiven so far as they affect the finding of the word; usually a group of\r\nforms that begin alike is represented by one of its simplest\r\nmembers--thus, in looking for =puso= or =pusiese= take '=puse= _see_\r\n=poner=' as guide. A statement of reflexive use is given under =se=, and\r\na verb is not separately defined as reflexive if its reflexive meaning\r\nis derivable from the non-reflexive by applying what is found under\r\n=se=. A participle which has reflexive force without the reflexive\r\npronoun is in general especially defined, but the student will do well\r\nto keep in mind the principle that any past participle may be a\r\nreflexive without the pronoun.\r\n\r\nThe effort has been made to list each defined phrase under the word that\r\nthe student was surest to look up, either the most unfamiliar word or\r\nthe one which he would identify as not having here its familiar sense.\r\nWhen the word which has here an unusual sense (or whose regular English\r\nequivalent is not used in translating this phrase) is one which will not\r\nbe looked up, such as a familiar preposition, its special definition for\r\nthis occasion is appended in parentheses to the appropriate definition\r\nof the other word, which definition it precedes or follows according to\r\nthe order of the Spanish phrase: thus, under =acabar=, 'end (=por=\r\nwith)' means '=acabar= end; =acabar por= end with'; under =adelante=,\r\n'(=más= further) on' means '=adelante= on; =más adelante= further on.'\r\nParentheses in a Spanish phrase inclose words which can be added without\r\naffecting the translation except as indicated by parenthesized English\r\nwords. Other parenthesized words are generally meant as mere\r\nexplanations, but can sometimes be advantageously taken as supplements\r\nto be optionally added to the definition.\r\n\r\nThe special definition of a phrase does not mean that the words which\r\nmake up that phrase may not be found together also with their ordinary\r\nmeanings. Thus, '=tener por= regard as' does not mean that =tener=\r\n'have' or 'hold' may not also be followed by =por= 'for' or 'by' in\r\nvarious senses; and the giving of a special definition for the reflexive\r\nuse of a verb does not mean that its reflexive use may not have also the\r\nsenses of its active use with the reflexive modifications described\r\nunder =se=. Nor does a special definition for a participle mean that the\r\nparticiple is not used also in the general sense of the verb.\r\n\r\nA rendering found in the vocabulary should not be distrusted because\r\nwhen put into the sentence it results in a bold use of words. Such uses\r\nare more or less characteristic of Galdós; and if the translator\r\nundertakes to reproduce Galdós' style in English, which is doubtless the\r\nhighest ideal of translation, he must not be too timid in his use of\r\nEnglish words. And the student should notice that the quality of the\r\nSpanish varies according to the person who speaks. Not every character\r\nin the book can be taken as a model of good conversational style,\r\ncultured or uncultured. Translate accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe citations from the Academy can usually be verified in other\r\nunabridged Spanish dictionaries; for these habitually copy the Academy\r\nverbatim. The student must not expect that the Academy shall be always\r\nright or always wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nABBREVIATIONS\r\n\r\nPeriods after abbreviations have been omitted where the abbreviation\r\nstands in especially close connection with the Spanish word.\r\n\r\n_A._ = the Academy's dictionary, or rarely its grammar.\r\n_acc._ = accusative.\r\n_adj._ = adjective.\r\n_adv._ = adverb.\r\n_augm._ = augmentative.\r\n_c._ = colloquial.\r\n_conj._ = conjunction.\r\n_d._ = diminutive.\r\n_dat._ = dative.\r\n_depr._ = depreciative.\r\n_Eng._ = English.\r\n_esp._ = especially.\r\n_f._ = feminine.\r\n_fig._ = figuratively.\r\n_G._ = Galdós.\r\n_Gall._ = Gallicism, Gallicistically.\r\n_i._ = intransitive.\r\n_im._ = impersonally.\r\n_ind._ = indicative.\r\n_inf._ = infinitive.\r\n_intj._ = interjection.\r\n_L._ = Latin.\r\n_lit._ = literally.\r\n_m._ = masculine.\r\n_N._ = note to.\r\n_neg._ = negative.\r\n_obs._ = obsolete.\r\n_pl._ = plural.\r\n_pr._ = pronoun.\r\n_prep._ = preposition.\r\n_ptc._ = past participle.\r\n_r._ = reflexive.\r\n_rel._ = relative.\r\n_sc._ = you are to think of.\r\n_sg._ = singular.\r\n_subj._ = subjunctive.\r\n_sup._ = superlative.\r\n_t._ = transitive.\r\n_tr._ = translate.\r\n_untr._ = to be left untranslated.\r\n_w._ = with.\r\n\r\n_adv._ =-mente= = the feminine of this adjective with the suffix\r\n=-mente= is used as an adverb, translated by adding the suffix '-ly' to\r\nthe definition of the adjective, or by putting 'in' before the adjective\r\nand 'fashion' after it.\r\n\r\n_conj. w._ =que= = with =que= it forms a phrase used as a conjunction;\r\nsame translation as without =que=.\r\n\r\n_prep. w._ =de= = with =de= it forms a phrase used as a preposition;\r\nsame translation as without =de=.\r\n\r\nThe sign =-= in the black type means the word which stood in black type\r\nat the head of the paragraph: =las -s= under =ala= means =las alas=.\r\nWhen this sign is accompanied by letters in black italic type, the\r\nmeaning is that the beginning or ending of the word at the head of the\r\nparagraph is to be changed to what is printed in black italics: _-do_\r\nunder =acabar= means =acabado=.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=a= to, into, on, at, in, for; _w. same word after as before_, by;\r\n_introduces personal direct object_; =a que= in order that, to have,\r\nI'll bet, what will you bet that; =a lo tonto= in a stupid way; =a la\r\nuna ... a las dos ... a las tres= one--two--three; _a los tres días_ in\r\nthree days; =¡a trabajar!= (go) to work; =estar a= _w. inf._ be ready\r\nto, be on a footing to; =cañón de a ocho= eight-pounder.\r\n=abajo= down, below; down-stairs; =hacia----= downward, down.\r\n=abandonar= _t_ abandon, forsake, break off, quit.\r\n=abandono= _m_ forsakenness.\r\n=abate= _m_ abbé.\r\n=abatir= _t_ cast down, abase.\r\n=abdomen= _m_ abdomen.\r\n=abeja= _f_ bee.\r\n=aberración= _f_ aberration.\r\n=abigarrado= gaudy, garish, motley.\r\n=abismo= _m_ abyss.\r\n=abnegación= _f_ self-abnegation.\r\n=abofetear= _t_ slap in the face.\r\n=abogacía= _f_ law (as profession).\r\n=abogadejo= _m_ limb of the law.\r\n=abogadillo= _m_ little lawyer.\r\n=abogado= _m_ lawyer, advocate.\r\n=abolengo= _m_ ancestry, parentage.\r\n=abominable= abominable.\r\n=abordar= _t (nautical)_ run into, come up to; (_of question_) enter\r\nupon, attack.\r\n=aborrecer= _t_ hate, abhor, detest.\r\n=aborrecimiento= _m_ hate.\r\n=abrasador= scorching.\r\n=abrasar= _t_ scorch, inflame; _r_ be all on fire (=en= with).\r\n=abrazar= _t_ (_r w._ =a=) embrace.\r\n=abrazo= _m_ embrace.\r\n=abrigo= _m_ shelter, protection; wrap.\r\n=abril= _m_ April.\r\n=abrir= _t_ open (=tanto= so wide); _=--ierto= adj._ open.\r\n=ábside= _m_ apse.\r\n=absoluto= absolute; unlimited; _adv._ =--mente=; =en----=\r\nunqualifiedly, outright.\r\n=absolver= _t_ absolve, exculpate.\r\n=absorber= _t_ absorb.\r\n=absorto= astounded, dumfounded.\r\n=abstener= _r_ abstain.\r\n=absurdo= absurd; _m_ absurdity.\r\n=abuelo= grandfather, forefather.\r\n=abundancia= _f_ abundance.\r\n=abundante= abundant, in abundance; _adv._ =--mente=.\r\n=abundar= _i_ abound.\r\n=abur= good-by (_curtly_).\r\n=aburrimiento= _m_ boredom, dull times, ennui.\r\n=aburrir= _t_ bore, weary; annoy.\r\n=acá= here (hither; _cf._ =acá 154= 2, =aquí 154= 3).\r\n=acabamiento= _m_ extinction, collapse.\r\n=acabar= _t or i_ finish; have just (=de=); come to an end, be over, be\r\ndone; end (=por= with); make an end (=con= of); =casi---- de= have\r\nhardly more than just; =y--emos= and done with it; =--do= complete,\r\nconsummate.
