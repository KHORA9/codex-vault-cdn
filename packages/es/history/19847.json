As regards the chief character, Quevedo, he is in\r\na large measure the embodiment of the whole literary spirit of the first\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century and at the same time the champion of\r\npolitical reform. The play is written in Castilian of such simplicity\r\nthat it presents almost no syntactical difficulties, and at the same\r\ntime embodies a useful vocabulary. The development of the plot, the\r\nstruggle between Olivares and Quevedo, is thoroughly logical and is\r\naided by scenes so intensely dramatic that they hold the interest of the\r\nreader at all times. Some of these scenes, so characteristic of even the\r\nbest plays of the Romantic School, to-day seem to verge on the\r\nmelodramatic. For this reason the student should be reminded that the\r\nheroic thunder of this kind of play was most acceptable to the\r\ntheater-goers of the middle of the last century. A sense of humor, then,\r\nshould temper any critical attitude on the part of those who may be\r\ninclined to take our play's shortcomings or exaggerations too seriously.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Florentino Sanz is comparatively unknown will justify the\r\ndetailed Biographical Sketch.\r\n\r\nThe text is a careful reproduction of that of the first edition, Madrid,\r\n1848, except, of course, for frequent corrections in punctuation. Only\r\nthe important stage directions have been retained; others that in great\r\nprofusion specify the facial expression and tone of voice of the actors\r\nhave been rejected in many places as more cumbersome than useful.\r\n\r\nR.S.R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nEULOGIO FLORENTINO SANZ\r\nHISTORICAL INTRODUCTION\r\nVERSIFICATION\r\nDON FRANCISCO DE QUEVEDO\r\nNOTES\r\nVOCABULARY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              EULOGIO FLORENTINO SANZ\r\n\r\n                BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Eulogio Florentino Sanz is little known outside of Spain,\r\nwhere for more than seventy years it has been closely linked with his\r\nchief dramatic achievement, \"Don Francisco de Quevedo,\" and with his\r\ntranslations from Heine. Now and then the plea that something be done\r\ntoward bringing out an edition of his works has found expression but met\r\nwith no response. To read his scattered verses it is necessary to search\r\nthe pages of that wilderness of papers, dailies, weeklies, monthlies,\r\nand annuals, which appeared in Madrid between 1840 and 1870. Though we\r\nare told that he wrote much, it is none the less true that he published\r\nnext to nothing. In 1848, at the age of twenty-seven he was freely\r\nspoken of as one of the most promising of his generation of poets and\r\ndramatists. Vanity and indolence at maturity prevented his fulfilling\r\nthe promise.\r\n\r\nHis boyhood was spent in Arévalo in the province of Ávila, where he was\r\nborn March 11, 1821. The village priest taught him Latin, and later he\r\nmay have been a student at the University of Valladolid. Of the years\r\nthat passed before he came to Madrid we know little besides a few\r\nanecdotes. According to one of these Sanz paid youthful court to the\r\ndaughter of a glazier whose ruin was threatened by lack of business. The\r\ndaughter told young Florentino of her father's difficulties in the\r\ncourse of an evening interview, whereupon the ambitious lover quickly\r\norganized a band of followers and broke all the windows in Arévalo.\r\n\r\nEarly in February of 1843 he was in Madrid, where he began to write for\r\nthe newspapers. Two years later a few poems published in the _Semanario\r\nPintoresco_, _El Heraldo_, and _La Risa_ won him some recognition. He\r\nnow identified himself with the group of romantic poets who held their\r\nmeetings in the famous Café del Príncipe. His sonnet \"La Discordia,\"\r\npublished in the _Semanario Pintoresco_, February, 1843, furnishes\r\nindisputable evidence of his romantic tendencies. In it a waning moon,\r\nfratricide, corpses, \"infernal sonrisa,\" and an agonized mother provide\r\nall the thrills of romantic horror; but it may be wiser to pass over in\r\nsilence such outbursts as this.\r\n\r\nAs a member of a circle which gathered in the Café del Recreo (1846) he\r\nlived in the very thick of romanticism. Its meetings are thus described:\r\n\r\n     At that time there existed in Madrid a club of literary fledglings.\r\n     The majority of the young men who ten years later had won\r\n     conspicuous places in the world of letters gathered there without\r\n     knowing exactly why. The nucleus at the Café del Recreo had been\r\n     formed by no one, nobody was formally presented, no one of our\r\n     number had been a friend or schoolmate of any one of the others;\r\n     the gathering was there _because it was there_, it existed _because\r\n     it existed_. The company included besides Sanz himself the poets\r\n     Mariano Cazurro, Antonio Trueba, Ventura Ruiz Aguilera, Antonio\r\n     Hurtado, José Albuerne, Antonio Arnao, the journalist Eduardo\r\n     Asquerino, the statesman Cánovas, and the dramatist Fernández y\r\n     González.--José de Castro y Serrano, _Prólogo_ (pp. ix-x) to \"Obras\r\n     de Francisco Zea,\" Madrid, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe movements and activities of Sanz in the literary world began to be\r\nchronicled in such papers as the _Fandango_, published by Wencelao\r\nAyguals de Izco and Francisco Villegas. They speak of him as \"our friend\r\nand collaborator.\" From them we learn that he was occupied in writing\r\n_semblanzas_, or portraits, of the most conspicuous literary lights of\r\nthe hour. Though these _semblanzas_ seem to have circulated in\r\nmanuscript, they never were printed. Eduardo de Lustoñó declared[1]\r\nthat Sanz was always a presumptuous person and particularly so in 1845.\r\nLustoñó wrote a squib, stupid enough to be sure, in which he implies\r\nthat the purpose of the _semblanzas_ was to ridicule the pedants.\r\nLustoñó enrolled him as private soldier in what he called his \"Regiment\r\nof Men of Letters,\" but it was an unconscious tribute to the ability of\r\nSanz to admit him even as a private in a regiment whose officers were:\r\nColonel, Quintana; Majors, Hartzenbusch, Tassara; Captains, Bretón,\r\nRivas; Lieutenants, Campoamor, Mesonero Romanos, and Frías,--all of whom\r\nhave won enduring fame.\r\n\r\nOn the night of February 1, 1848, \"Don Francisco de Quevedo\" was\r\npresented in the Teatro del Príncipe. The distinguished actor and poet\r\nDon Julian Romea chose the occasion for a benefit performance. The play\r\nwas an instant success. The number of the _Semanario Pintoresco_ which\r\nfollowed the first performance printed a flattering review:\r\n\r\n     The drama \"Don Francisco de Quevedo,\" presented at the Príncipe for\r\n     the benefit of Don Julian Romea, has won for its author, Don\r\n     Eulogio Florentino Sanz, a place of distinction among our\r\n     dramatists. Success in portraying the personage from whom the piece\r\n     takes its name, resourceful stagecraft, daring situations, and a\r\n     versification now serious, now gay, frolicsome or sorrowful, but\r\n     always agreeable, facile, and correct, these are the distinguishing\r\n     features of the play with which Señor Sanz has made himself known\r\n     to the theater-going public. Don Julian Romea gave an able\r\n     interpretation of the part of Don Francisco de Quevedo, Señora Díaz\r\n     was excellent as the Infanta Margarita. The rest of the cast\r\n     contributed ably to the success of the drama.\r\n\r\nThis notice conveys some idea of the striking enthusiasm with which the\r\npiece was received.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with his literary predilections Sanz had already identified\r\nhimself politically with the progressive liberal party.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Imparcial de Madrid_, December 3, 1901.]\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately preceding the overthrow of the Conservatives\r\n(1845) Sanz gave his services to the progressive liberal cause. In 1849\r\nhe was editor of _La Patria_, whose first number appeared on January 2.\r\nIt announced a policy of political moderation, but its real purpose was\r\nthe most strenuous opposition to the government of the reactionary\r\nconservatives. Sanz was generally believed to be editor-in-chief.\r\nSuddenly on the fourth of January he resigned[2] with no explanation\r\nwhatsoever to the subscribers. A little later he appeared on the staff\r\nof _La Víbora, periódico venenoso redactado por los peores literatos de\r\nEspaña, bajo la dirección de nadie_ (\"The Viper, a venomous paper,\r\nedited by the worst scribblers in Spain, under the management of\r\nnobody\"). The censorship was as crushing as in the days of Larra. Later,\r\nin September, _La Patria_ announced another periodical, _La Sátira_,\r\nadding that it was to be under the direction of the editors of the\r\nshort-lived _Víbora_. This second attempt also met with disaster. Again\r\nin June of 1851 Sanz resigned from another paper, _El Mundo Nuevo_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Notices of the appearance of this paper and of Sanz's\r\nresignation will be found in _La Guía_ of January 3 and 4, 1849.]\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the tide turned. The revolution of July found him writing his\r\nsecond play, \"Los Achaques de la Vejez.\"[3] The conclusion of the last\r\nact had to be postponed while Sanz was taking part in the popular rising\r\nwhich he had so earnestly sought. While he was waiting for his share of\r\nthe rewards of victory the play was produced at the Príncipe on the\r\nevening of October 13. On the fourteenth there appeared in _La Iberia_\r\nthe following notice, written probably by his devoted friend Pedro Calvo\r\nAsensio:\r\n\r\n     _Los Achaques de la Vejez_. This notable comedy by the gifted and\r\n     well-known author Don Eulogio Florentino Sanz was played\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The original manuscript of this play is preserved in the\r\nBiblioteca Nacional at Madrid. At the end of Act I appears the date\r\nJunio 13, 1854. At the end of the second Julio 5, 1854, and on the last\r\nsheet Setiembre 25, 1854.]\r\n\r\n     last night with brilliant success. At the end of the second act the\r\n     author was called upon the stage, and at the end of the play the\r\n     enthusiasm of the audience grew to such extraordinary proportions\r\n     that Sr. Sanz was again called upon to appear. However, we were\r\n     denied the satisfaction of seeing him, as he had left the theater.\r\n     The actors also were called before the curtain amidst tumultuous\r\n     applause as a just reward for their signal success in the\r\n     presentation of the play. The audience was as we had expected,\r\n     large and select. Our conviction that the management may look\r\n     forward to well-filled houses gives us great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe writing of this play was in a measure Sanz's answer to the challenge\r\nof his enemies and detractors to repeat the success of \"Don Francisco de\r\nQuevedo.\" By this second triumph his fame and reputation were firmly\r\nestablished. This time the theme is a domestic one developed with even\r\ngreater skill than that displayed in the earlier play. As might be\r\nexpected, Act I, scene iv, contains a pessimistic and cynical allusion\r\nto the tangled politics that preceded the revolution.\r\n\r\nBy a royal order of November 11 Sanz was appointed secretary of the\r\nfirst class to the Spanish legation in Berlin.[4] This appointment he\r\nprobably owed to the good offices of his friend Nicomedes Pastor Díaz.\r\nSanz took possession of his new post on the ninth of January, 1855,\r\nafter having made the journey from Madrid in the company of Gregorio\r\nCruzada Villamil. In June he was granted four months' leave of absence\r\non account of ill health due to the severity of the climate. In August\r\nhe was made Commander of the Order of Charles III in recognition of his\r\ndistinguished service. His final resignation from the post was received\r\nin November of 1856. He left Berlin for Madrid on February 1, 1857.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: All the papers relating to Sanz's diplomatic career are\r\npreserved in the Archivo del Ministerio del Estado. They were collected\r\nat the instance of his \"widow,\" who desired that she be accorded a\r\npension in keeping with the dignity of the posts held by her\r\ndistinguished husband. The papers are filed under _Personal Español,\r\nLetra S, Año 1853. Número 159. Expediente relativo a Sanz, don Eulogio\r\nFlorentino_.]\r\n\r\nHis only poem surely written in Berlin is the \"Epístola a Pedro.\"[5] It\r\nis a tender tribute to the memory of the poet Enrique Gil, who had died\r\nin Berlin ten years before. Its verses are among the most delicately\r\nbeautiful that Sanz ever wrote. The poem opens with an expression of the\r\nlonging which Sanz feels for his beloved Spain, and above all for\r\nMadrid:\r\n\r\n    Pues recuerda la patria, a los reflejos\r\n    de su distante sol, el desterrado\r\n    como recuerdan su niñez los viejos.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Pedro is Don Pedro Calvo Asensio, the editor-in-chief of\r\n_La Iberia_, in which the poem first appeared. It was later republished\r\nin 1881 in the \"Almanaque de _La Iberia_.\"]\r\n\r\nHe stands before the grave of Enrique Gil and mourns for the poet who\r\ndied unwept in a foreign land. In deep sincerity of feeling no other\r\npoem of Sanz approaches the \"Epístola.\" Fortunately it has been given to\r\nthe public both in Menéndez y Pelayo's \"Cien Mejores Poesías\" and in\r\n\"The Oxford Book of Spanish Verse.\"\r\n\r\nThese two years of residence in Berlin had a profound effect upon the\r\ntemper of Sanz's later verse. It was only natural that his removal from\r\nthe turmoil of life in Madrid, with its petty jealousies and quarrels,\r\nliterary and political, should exercise a broadening and sobering\r\ninfluence upon his muse. After this date the flow of idle humorous verse\r\nceased. Inspired chiefly by the exquisite delicacy of Heine's lyrics, he\r\nset himself to imitation and translation of his German model. It is not\r\ntoo much to say that all his published verse after this was deeply\r\ntinged with this side of Heine.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1857 he was in Madrid again, enjoying his prestige as a\r\npoet, diplomat, and political writer. His presence at a gathering of\r\nliterary men in May to do honor to the memory of the great Quintana was\r\nan event.[6] A week earlier his translation of fifteen of Heine's lyrics\r\nhad appeared in the _Museo Universal_ under the caption \"Poesía Alemana,\r\nCanciones de Enrique Heine.\" What a grateful contrast they furnish to\r\nthe undisciplined bursts of romantic thunder that he was writing only a\r\nfew years before! Sanz had been completely won over to the intense\r\nrefinement of emotion and diction of Heine. From this time on, the\r\nexpression of gentle melancholy and spiritual sensitiveness dominates\r\nthe few poems that he published.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Cf. _La Iberia_, May 22, 1857.]\r\n\r\nThe brief taste of diplomatic life which he had had seems to have put an\r\nend to any really creative activity. A tribute to the memory of the\r\nyoung poet Francisco Zea, written in May, 1858,[7] contains what is\r\nreally his farewell to a life of letters. Therein, after discussing the\r\npessimistic statement of Larra that in Spain \"No se lee porque no se\r\nescribe, y no se escribe porque no se lee,\" he declares that people in\r\nSpain are writing, but that no one is reading. It is not the fault of\r\nthose who write, he continues, and waste the treasures of their youth in\r\na fruitless struggle. In Spain one must write for pure love of letters,\r\nand unfortunately this is the most platonic of loves. There are few\r\nreaders of literature in general, and of lyric poetry almost none. He\r\nresents the intrusion of the latter into the drama, where it is heard\r\nwith pleasure by people, comfortably seated in stalls, who in the\r\nmorning could not endure Fray Luis de León or Francisco de la Torre. His\r\nsmall stock of patience exhausted, Sanz turned to diplomatic life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"Obras En Verso y Prosa de Don Francisco Zea.\" Madrid, pp.\r\n552, 556.]\r\n\r\nOn the eleventh of August of 1859 he was appointed Minister to the\r\nEmpire of Brazil, and on the same day he was named representative in the\r\nCortes. A month later he wrote to the Secretary of State to say that he\r\nmust resign the post \"for reasons which I have had the honor to submit\r\nverbally to your Excellency's consideration.\" At this time he seems to\r\nhave gone into complete retirement, resisting the entreaties of\r\ntheater-managers and actors to write again for the stage. In the next\r\nfourteen years he published only a half-dozen or more poems, although\r\nhis name appeared in the list of _colaboradores_ of several papers,\r\namong them the _Gaceta Literaria_, _España Literaria_, and _La América_.\r\nApparently his disillusionment was complete. In the _Versos a Amalia_\r\n(_La América_, Sept. 8, 1858) are these significant lines:\r\n\r\n    Sonreí de ambición ante la vana\r\n      Sombra de mi deseo;\r\n    Y al despuntar el sol de mi mañana,\r\n    Vi mi horizonte azul (¡que ya no veo!)...\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Yo fué persiguiendo la límpida estrella\r\n      Que allá en lontananza\r\n      Resplandece entre todas; aquella\r\n      Que deslumbra con locos reflejos,\r\n    Que siempre se sigue, que nunca se alcanza.\r\n    ¡Pérfida estrella de la esperanza\r\n    Que alumbra sólo, sólo de lejos!\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Yo en la mar busqué la gloria\r\n    Y de allí torno sin ella.\r\n\r\nIn September of 1872 Sanz was drawn from his retreat by an appointment\r\nto Tangier as Minister Plenipotentiary at a salary of 15,000 pesetas\r\nannually. He began his duties in December and continued at his post for\r\nexactly a year. Again he pleaded ill health and was granted two months'\r\nleave of absence. That he did not return immediately to Madrid is clear\r\nfrom his request of February 12 to be allowed to bring into Cadiz, duty\r\nfree, a hundred bottles of wine. Early in January, 1873, his appointment\r\nto Tangier was confirmed by Amadeo. On the establishment of the\r\nrepublic in February Sanz tendered his resignation, but Castelar himself\r\nrefused to accept it. In June he finally left his post at Tangier after\r\nhaving been appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States of\r\nMexico. As usual he excused himself on the ground of ill health, and his\r\nresignation was accepted in the following September. Sanz certainly\r\ncould not complain that his merits were unrecognized. In the decree\r\nappointing him to the post at Tangier his honors are mentioned as _Gran\r\nCruz de la Real y Distinguida Orden de Carlos III, Orden Civil de Maria\r\nVictoria, Caballero de la Ínclita de San Juan de Jerusalem, ex Diputado\r\na Cortes_.\r\n\r\nHis movements from this time forward are extremely difficult to follow.\r\nIn 1878 his name appears in the official list of members of the\r\n_Asociación de Escritores y Artistas_, and his domicile is given as 45\r\nCalle de Atocha. The men that knew him in the closing years of his life\r\nagree that he dragged out a miserable existence in the utmost poverty,\r\ndependent upon the generosity of his friends. They speak highly of his\r\nmoral integrity, deploring at the same time the weakness of character\r\nwhich prevented his realizing the promise of his early years. He died\r\nApril 29, 1881, and was buried in the cemetery of San Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Philip IV became king of Spain in 1621 he inherited a kingdom whose\r\nresources had been recklessly wasted. His father, Philip III, had been\r\nruled by the most inept of ministers, the Duke of Lerma. Great sums of\r\nmoney, wrung from the productive lower classes, had been spent to carry\r\non a fruitless war in the Netherlands, to provide amusement for an idle,\r\nfrivolous court, and to fill the pockets of the minister's creatures.\r\nGovernment was in the hands of a bureaucracy of parasites. The\r\ncollective conscience of the governing class had withered and died. The\r\noffice-holders in this bureaucracy had come to regard the acquisition of\r\nriches at the expense of the state as one of their official privileges.\r\n\r\nIf Spain were to maintain her preëminent position as the greatest power\r\nin Europe the most radical economic reform was necessary. Stimulus must\r\nbe given to the productive activity of the country by relief from\r\noppressive taxation, and expenditure must be wisely restrained and\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nThe situation demanded a man of exceptional keenness of vision, great\r\nenergy, and absolute integrity. There were not lacking men who foresaw\r\nthe disaster that threatened, men who still kept some of that energy and\r\nfearlessness that had made America a Spanish dependency, but such\r\nindividuals were silenced as menaces rather than encouraged as helpers.\r\nIn Philip himself the mental vigor and physical stamina of the Spanish\r\nHapsburgs had been greatly diminished. The consanguineous marriages of\r\nhis immediate ancestors had weakened the stock. There can be no doubt\r\nthat he loved his people in his own pitiful, ineffectual way, but he\r\nwas hopelessly weak; lacking in the ability and even the will to rule,\r\nhe delegated government to Don Gaspar de Guzmán, Count of Olivares and\r\nsoon to be the first Duke of San Lúcar.\r\n\r\nHere, on the other hand, was a man of undoubted energy and courage. Yet\r\nhis weakness was his utter lack of vision and his inability to profit by\r\nthe mistakes of his predecessors. He had many a lesson to learn in the\r\nfailure of the reigns of Philip II and Philip III; he should have seen\r\nthat the reason for the disasters of the former was the continuance of a\r\nhopeless war in the Netherlands for the sake of an ideal of religious\r\nunity which the progress of the sixteenth century had made impossible;\r\nabove all he should have realized the economic folly of a system of\r\ntaxation and industrial repression that was choking the nation.\r\n\r\nOlivares himself was to blame for the initial appearance in the\r\nmachinery of the State of only a few vital weaknesses, for at the\r\nbeginning of his administration many fatal tendencies were already at\r\nwork. But because he failed to check those tendencies he must ever be\r\nthe scapegoat. To be sure he signalized his arrival by a few months of\r\nrigid economy, but he did not cut deep enough. He soon realized the\r\nfutility of saving where there was nothing to save. Then, either because\r\nhe failed to see the source of the evil or because he lacked the\r\nconstructive ability to attack it, he went to the extreme of lavish\r\nexpenditure. As the situation grew more and more hopeless he temporized,\r\nstriving to hide the internal decay beneath a gilded exterior of\r\nostentatious wealth. As he plunged deeper his critics grew bolder, and\r\nto silence them his rule became more barbarously arbitrary.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he found himself face to face with the great Richelieu at the\r\nhead of a rich and well-administered France. Under him France was to\r\nbecome organized and to extend her dominions to her natural physical\r\nboundaries--at the expense of Spain. Olivares ruled Spain from 1621\r\nuntil 1643, Richelieu ruled France from 1622 until 1642; it was a\r\nlife-long duel between the two ministers. Richelieu laid the foundation\r\nfor the greatness of Louis XIV, while Olivares made inevitable the\r\nabject impotence of Spain under Charles II.\r\n\r\nThe culminating disasters began to arrive in 1640 with the rebellion of\r\nCatalonia. The determination of the Catalans in 1626 to grant Philip no\r\nmore arbitrary taxes marks the beginning of the revolt that ended with\r\nthe entire loss of Catalonia. Olivares could never forget its opposition\r\nto his will. While the Catalans in 1639 were bravely resisting the\r\nentrance of French troops into Roussillon, Santa Coloma, the viceroy of\r\nOlivares, made even more severe his policy of sternness and repression.\r\nThe Catalans were to be driven against the French and to be made to\r\nunderstand by the application of brute force that the welfare of their\r\nparticular province was of small importance beside the prosperity of the\r\nkingdom in general. The Spanish soldiers quartered upon them behaved\r\nwith such lawlessness that in May of 1640 the population of Barcelona\r\nbroke into open rebellion. Santa Coloma was cut down in his attempt to\r\nescape the consequences of his lack of diplomacy and tact. From\r\nBarcelona the revolt soon spread through the entire province. It has\r\nbeen said that the gentle measures of repression inaugurated by the new\r\nviceroy, the Duke of Cardona, particularly displeased Olivares, who saw\r\nat last what he believed to be his opportunity utterly to crush Catalan\r\nliberty. The answer of the Catalans was to throw themselves into the\r\nhands of the French and Richelieu, by seeking foreign aid against\r\nCastile.\r\n\r\nIn September 1640 an army under the Marqués de los Vélez was sent north\r\nto straighten out the tangled affairs of Catalonia. At first he was\r\nsuccessful, but in January 1641 he was beaten back from Barcelona itself\r\nafter a bloody defeat at the hands of the local soldiery.\r\n\r\nTo make sure of French aid the rebels offered their allegiance to Louis\r\nXIII of France, and the revolt was kept alive with French money and\r\nsoldiers, while Philip's armies were invariably defeated.\r\n\r\nTo complete our picture of the political situation we must turn for a\r\nmoment to Portugal. There reluctant allegiance to the Spanish crown had\r\nalready been severely strained during the previous reign by the\r\nhigh-handed procedure of Lerma, the favorite of Philip III. Portuguese\r\nadministrative offices had been filled in Madrid, and the country was\r\ninconsiderately taxed to maintain Castilian sovereignty. Under Philip IV\r\nthe regent of the kingdom was Doña Margarita, Duchess of Mantua and\r\ngranddaughter of Philip II.[8] While she was ostensibly in control of\r\nthe difficult Portuguese situation, the real ruler was Don Miguel\r\nVasconcellos, a Portuguese of scant ability and bloodthirsty instincts;\r\nhe was kept in command by Olivares dictating from Madrid. The\r\nannouncement of Vasconcellos to the nation that it was the intention of\r\nOlivares to remove the last vestige of constitutional rule in Portugal\r\nby the suppression of the Portuguese Cortes drove the patriots to rally\r\nabout the Duke of Braganza. A well-planned conspiracy was set on foot to\r\nplace Braganza on the throne of Portugal and thus to rid the country\r\nforever of the hated Castilian sovereignty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Philip II had married his daughter, the infanta Catalina,\r\nto Charles Emmanuel of Savoy.]\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of all his attempts to bring Braganza to Madrid,\r\nOlivares tried desperately to win his favor by apparently putting the\r\nfate of Portugal entirely in his hands. It was a fatal course. Olivares\r\nsent him large sums of money to raise troops to keep the Portuguese\r\nsituation in control and help in the repression of the Catalans; then he\r\nput Braganza at the head of them.\r\n\r\nIn November of 1640 Braganza proclaimed himself king. The regent\r\nMargaret was imprisoned. Vasconcellos was killed by the mob.\r\n\r\nThe news was received in Madrid with the deepest dismay. Pellicer[9]\r\nwrote: \"These announcements should be written with blood, and deserve to\r\nbe wept over rather than written, for they contain nothing less than the\r\nrebellion of Portugal and the coronation of Don Juan, whom they call\r\nJuan IV, the Duke of Braganza.\" It is commonly stated that Olivares\r\nannounced the news of the rebellion to Philip by congratulating him upon\r\nthe opportunity thus offered to seize the property of Braganza.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Avisos de 11 de Diciembre de 1640._]\r\n\r\nTo add to the troubles in Portugal and Catalonia just described, a plot\r\nby the Duke of Medina Sidonia to make himself independent sovereign of\r\nAndalusia was discovered only just in time to prevent a serious rising.\r\n\r\nThe advisability of Philip's putting himself in person at the head of\r\nthe troops in the north had long been the subject of earnest and bitter\r\ndiscussion between Olivares and his enemies. The latter had urged upon\r\nPhilip the necessity of seeing with his own eyes the pass to which\r\nmatters had been brought by the ineptitude and recklessness of his\r\nminister. This could best be accomplished by a visit of inspection to\r\nthe revolted provinces. Moreover, with Philip and Olivares away from the\r\ncapital the queen and those of the nobility who were working for the\r\ndownfall of Olivares could proceed with a freer hand.\r\n\r\nWhen once the royal party had left, Doña Isabel set about her task with\r\ntrue nobility and great energy. She was almost heroic in her efforts to\r\nencourage and inspire with loyalty to the crown the troops garrisoned in\r\nMadrid. She even sold her jewels to raise money for the campaign in\r\nAragon.\r\n\r\nPhilip, meanwhile, was traveling slowly northward with great pomp and\r\nceremony. Olivares was straining every nerve to prevent the king's\r\nrealizing the desperateness of the situation. The monarch was denied to\r\nall visitors, and his attention was distracted by elaborate hunting\r\nexpeditions. As he progressed toward Aragon, the French, moving\r\nsouthward, occupied Monzón.\r\n\r\nDecember of 1642 found Philip again in Madrid. Portugal was hopelessly\r\nlost, Roussillon was in the hands of the French, while Catalonia and\r\nAragon were in open revolt. Briefly sketched, this was the political\r\nsituation at the opening of our play.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Spain was at this time economically bankrupt, the reigns of Philip\r\nIII and Philip IV comprise nevertheless the most brilliant decades of\r\nthe Golden Century. These are the years that are marked by the greatest\r\nliterary activity of Lope de Vega, Cervantes, and Quevedo. Lope had made\r\nthe theater national and had prepared the way for the romantic genius of\r\nCalderón, while a throng of lesser lights, such as Tirso de Molina and\r\nJuan Ruiz de Alarcón, were delighting the capital with plays in great\r\nprofusion. For all this a great stimulus had come from the\r\ntheater-loving Philip III, who lavished money without stint upon the\r\ngorgeous production of comedies, pageants, and masques.\r\n\r\nCervantes had shown the way to the novelists. In prose fiction true\r\ncharacterization had developed to keep pace with extensive and elaborate\r\nnarrative elements. At the same time the outburst of lyric poetry was no\r\nless striking. The ability to write verse had become truly a necessary\r\nqualification for social success and even for political advancement.\r\nGreat magnates surrounded themselves with a retinue of poets and men of\r\nletters who depended upon them for their support.\r\n\r\nDon Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas, the central figure of our play, was\r\none of the greatest personalities in this brilliant court. He was born\r\nin 1580. At barely twenty he left the University of Alcalá and plunged\r\nimmediately into the life of the magnificently corrupt court of Philip\r\nIII at Valladolid. When the capital was moved to Madrid in 1606 he had\r\nalready won fame as a poet. The manuscripts of his satirical writings\r\nin prose and verse were eagerly sought and widely read. His thrusts were\r\naimed at the ridiculous aspects of court life. His own indulgence in a\r\ncareer of thorough dissipation filled him with contempt for his wretched\r\ncompanions. Intimate association with men in high positions reached by\r\neither noble birth or corrupt influence made him familiar with the vices\r\nof Philip's government and with the ineffectiveness of the Spanish\r\nbureaucratic administration. In his \"Sueños\" (Visions) he satirized\r\nunsparingly men from all the walks of life. His attacks were at times\r\nmocking jeers at human weaknesses and at others outbursts of desperate\r\nfury against current injustice and stupidity.\r\n\r\nAfter a short period of retirement from the capital he became the firm\r\nfriend of Don Pedro Téllez Girón, Duke of Osuna, who had been named\r\nviceroy of Sicily in 1610. The uncommonly strong bond of friendship\r\nbetween these two men was founded upon mutual admiration of common\r\nqualities of fearlessness and red-blooded dash and spirit. In 1616\r\nQuevedo followed Osuna to Naples, where he was of great service to him\r\nas adviser and confidential emissary. These years of semi-official\r\nactivity brought Quevedo into the very midst of the tangle of politics\r\ninvolving France, Italy, and Spain, and above all into the bog of\r\nbureaucratic corruption. Osuna's business in Madrid with the prime\r\nminister, Lerma, was managed by Quevedo. Now Lerma and his creatures\r\nwere amenable to reason only when accompanied by bribes. Access to him\r\nwas denied to all who brought no gifts. Quevedo's disgust at these\r\nmethods was boundless, but there was no avoiding them.[10] In\r\nrecognition of his distinguished services Quevedo was made a knight of\r\nthe order of St. James in 1618.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: No less a person than the Attorney General wrote to Osuna\r\nof a prominent person at court, \"Your Excellency may be quite sure of M.\r\nHe wants a carpet; send him two, and pray God that some one else does\r\nnot give him three.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: In the play there is a trifling anachronism according to\r\nwhich we are to believe that in 1643 Quevedo had not yet received this\r\nhonor.]\r\n\r\nIn 1620 Osuna came to Madrid to answer the charge of having conspired to\r\nmake himself independent viceroy of Naples. On his arrival he was thrown\r\ninto prison, while Quevedo was held in custody at a distance from\r\nMadrid. Osuna died in 1624 before his guilt or innocence could be\r\nclearly proved. Quevedo afterward fought to clear his protector's name.\r\nAt least he has secured his fame to posterity by the famous sonnet,\r\n\r\n    Faltar pudo su patria al grande Osuna,\r\n    Pero no a su defensa sus hazañas;\r\n    Diéronle muerte y carcel las Españas,\r\n    De quien el hizo esclava la Fortuna.\r\n    Lloraron sus invidias una a una\r\n    Con las propias naciones las extrañas;\r\n    Su tumba son de Flandes las campañas,\r\n    Y su epitafio la sangrienta luna.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Quevedo was enduring his enforced retirement Philip III died\r\n(March, 1621) and was succeeded by his son Philip IV. Uceda, the\r\nformer's minister, was sent to follow his father Lerma into retirement\r\nand disgrace. Olivares, who had already won the confidence of young\r\nPhilip, was installed as prime minister.\r\n\r\nSuperficial reforms by which Olivares signalized his arrival momentarily\r\nled Quevedo to hope for better things. He wrote to celebrate the wisdom\r\nof the new minister and to assure him of his loyalty. He was soon at\r\nliberty to enjoy the fame and wholesome respect that his political\r\nprominence and keen satire had won him. His enemies were numerous, but\r\nthey dared not attack him. Olivares himself courted Quevedo, but the\r\nlatter, grown discreet for the moment, lent his ear and not his heart:\r\nhe could not give himself to a minister who was already beginning to\r\nshow his unwillingness to go to the root of the evils that were ruining\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nDuring these years of comparative political inactivity Quevedo had\r\ngreater opportunity to study the vicious standards of living that stain\r\nthis period of Spanish history. His writings are full of the scathing\r\nirony of his youth on the one hand, or of passionate religious fervor on\r\nthe other. At other moments he indulges his tendency to seek refuge and\r\ncomfort in the gentle stoicism of Seneca.\r\n\r\nHis reckless slurs on women did not prevent his taking a wife in 1633.\r\nPerhaps Doña Esperanza de Aragón possessed the qualities that Quevedo\r\nhad flippantly demanded:\r\n\r\n     Noble, virtuous, and of good understanding, neither ugly nor\r\n     beautiful; of these two extremes I prefer her beautiful, because it\r\n     is better to have something to guard than some one to flee from.\r\n     Neither rich nor poor, that she may not be buying me, nor I her. I\r\n     desire her cheerful, for in our daily life we shall not lack for\r\n     gloom. I wish her neither a young girl nor an old woman, cradle nor\r\n     coffin, because I have forgotten my lullabies and not yet learned\r\n     the prayers for the dying. I should thank God infinitely if she\r\n     were deaf and a stammerer. But after all I shall esteem a woman\r\n     such as I desire _y sabré sufrir la que fuere como yo la merezco_.\r\n\r\nTheir married life was cut short by the death of Doña Esperanza in the\r\nmiddle of the following year.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of Quevedo's thinly-veiled distrust of the\r\nadministration of Olivares during these years, nor that he foresaw the\r\nimpending catastrophe. The campaign which he was now carrying on against\r\nthe favorite drew upon him not only the fear but the hatred of Olivares.\r\nPhilip himself was blind to the state of the peninsula, thanks to\r\nOlivares' successful efforts to keep him amused.\r\n\r\nFinally one day early in December of 1639 Philip found in his napkin a\r\npetition in verse. It contained an eloquent description of the wretched\r\ncondition of the country and a bitter arraignment of Olivares. Every\r\ncircumstance pointed to Quevedo as the author. On the seventh of\r\nDecember he was arrested and his papers were confiscated. His\r\ndisappearance was so sudden and complete that it was generally believed\r\nthat he had been summarily done to death, but in reality he had been\r\nrushed to a dungeon in the monastery of San Marcos just outside the\r\nwalls of the city of León. Here he received treatment probably intended\r\nto cause his death, for he wrote to his friend Adán de la Parra:\r\n\r\n     Although at first I had a tower of this holy dwelling for my\r\n     prison... within a short time I was brought to another a great deal\r\n     more comfortless. There I remain. It is nothing more than an\r\n     underground room, as damp as a spring, so dark that it is almost\r\n     always night in it, and so cold that it never ceases to seem\r\n     January. Clear enough! they that take pleasure in seeing me suffer\r\n     do not wish to cut once for all that which they must finally cut,\r\n     but they wish rather that the frequency of their blows may make my\r\n     martyrdom more painful by its longer continuance; for thus their\r\n     satisfaction gains in length.\r\n\r\n     The tomb where I am buried alive is barely twenty-four feet long\r\n     and nineteen wide. The vault and walls are in many places crumbling\r\n     with dampness, and everything is so miserable that it appears\r\n     rather the refuge of outlaw robbers than the prison of an honest\r\n     man.\r\n\r\n     To enter it one must pass through two doors equally strong. One is\r\n     at the level of the monastery floor and the other at the level of\r\n     my cell, after twenty-eight steps that have the look of a\r\n     precipice. Both are always closed except at moments when, more by\r\n     courtesy than through confidence, they leave one open but the other\r\n     doubly guarded.\r\n\r\n     In the middle of the room there stands a table where I am writing.\r\n     It is large enough to permit of thirty or more books, with which my\r\n     holy brothers keep me provided. At the right (to the south) I have\r\n     my neither very comfortable nor extremely wretched bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The furniture of this miserable habitation consists of four chairs,\r\n     a brasier, and a lamp. There is always noise enough, for the sound\r\n     of my fetters drowns other greater ones, if not by its volume, by\r\n     its pitifulness.... Not long ago I had two pairs, but one of the\r\n     monks obtained permission to leave me with only one pair. Those\r\n     that I am wearing now weigh about eight or nine pounds; the ones\r\n     they took off were much heavier.... Such is the life to which I\r\n     have been reduced by him who because I would not be his favorite is\r\n     to-day my enemy.\r\n\r\nHe endured his confinement with fortitude, sustained by the conviction\r\nthat he had given his best for the cause of justice.\r\n\r\nThe series of disasters that ultimately caused the fall of Olivares on\r\nJanuary 23, 1643, has been discussed in another part of this\r\nintroduction. Quevedo's release followed in June, but the iron had\r\nalready entered his soul. A little more than two weeks before his death\r\nhe wrote to his friend Francisco de Oviedo in a tone of profound\r\ndiscouragement:\r\n\r\n     They write bad news from everywhere, desperate news; and the worst\r\n     of it is that every one expected it. All this, Don Francisco, I\r\n     know not if it be drawing to its close or if it be already ended.\r\n     God knows, for there are many things which, though they seem to\r\n     exist and to have being, are no longer more than a word and a form.\r\n\r\nHe died at the age of sixty-five on September 8, 1645, at Villanueva de\r\nlos Infantes.\r\n\r\nEven the bare enumeration of the more important events of Quevedo's life\r\nsuggests his eager activity. This characteristic is the most striking\r\nfeature of his style. An idea is no sooner suggested than it is left\r\nundeveloped to make way for another, set down often in a sentence which\r\nin its turn is without a satisfactory conclusion; or the expression of\r\nit is so condensed that we marvel at its retaining any lucidity. Many of\r\nhis earlier writings are little more than a series of sketches that\r\nappear to have been written with feverish impatience but at the same\r\ntime with great penetration. In his satirical verses there is a world of\r\ndouble meanings and allusions that leaves the reader's mind dizzy. The\r\nvariety of his works is great. His facile creative brain passed from a\r\nribald ballad or _letrilla_ to a life of St. Francis de Sales or a\r\ntreatise on Divine Providence. But through them all one can discern the\r\nmotif of patriotism in the form of virulent satire against the vices\r\nthat were gnawing at the life of the nation, or of a fervent plea for\r\nbetter standards in public and private life. When he felt the impotence\r\nof his rage or the fruitlessness of his pleas he turned earnestly and\r\nlongingly to his cherished Seneca. But even in this frame of mind we\r\ncannot help feeling that there is something intensely passionate in his\r\nvery patience. He gave his best years to the battle against national\r\ndecay. Perhaps it is not too much to say that he died of disappointment\r\nand disgust.\r\n\r\nQuevedo's life, then, is by no means devoid of aspects that would appeal\r\nstrongly to a romantic poet like Florentino Sanz. The most striking\r\nfeature, of course, is his struggle with Olivares, followed by apparent\r\ndefeat and imprisonment at San Marcos de León, which in reality meant a\r\nmoral victory in the face of persecution. This in itself was an ideal\r\nsituation to call forth the heroics of a romantic poet. Furthermore,\r\nQuevedo could properly complain that he had been misunderstood. He was\r\ngiving himself to a great cause while many of his contemporaries\r\nrecognized only the superficial wit or the obscenity of his satire. His\r\nproud scorn of stupidity and all mediocrity was easily susceptible of a\r\nromantic twist into a lofty contempt for the miserable human creatures\r\nthat drag out their darkened groveling lives. To make the play an\r\nunqualified success it was necessary that Quevedo succumb to the gentle\r\npassion, although in reality Quevedo's stern heart had little room for\r\nit. There can be no denying his cynical disbelief in feminine virtue.\r\nAssociations of his own choice gave him little opportunity for illusions\r\non that score. To be sure, he married at fifty-two, but circumstances\r\nlead us to doubt his happiness. Quevedo in love is thorny ground for\r\nany author. It is difficult to understand how Sanz succeeded in making\r\nthis innovation as plausible as it is. It is his surrender to virtues so\r\nsterling as those of Margarita de Saboya that saves him from being\r\nridiculous. Perhaps one may be pardoned for a furtive smile at the\r\nimplication that Quevedo must depart to mope in his tower, while\r\nMargarita, herself a widow, pines in the convent.\r\n\r\nThe name Quevedo has come to connote vaguely a personage of achievements\r\nas fabulous as those of Robin Hood. His undoubted skill as a swordsman\r\nhas made him the hero of a thousand nocturnal escapades. His proverbial\r\nwit has forced upon him the responsibility for doubtful puns and\r\ninnumerable bits of repartee. Unfortunately this is true to such a\r\ndegree that to the uninitiated Quevedo is little more than a buffoon or\r\na swaggering swordsman. It is easy to see that in his play Sanz intended\r\nto combat this mistaken conception. When it was first presented in 1848\r\nthere existed no authoritative and accessible edition of Quevedo's\r\nworks[12] where he could be adequately studied and a fair estimate of\r\nhim made. Such works of his as were spread broad-cast were usually the\r\nmore objectionable excerpts from his less creditable works. They\r\nappeared in wretched volumes bearing a close resemblance to some that\r\nare published even now under such titles as \"Quevedo, His Wittiest\r\nProse, His Funniest Verses.\" Sanz felt the injustice deeply and set\r\nabout its correction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The first volume of Fernández-Guerra's splendid edition\r\nappeared in 1852.]\r\n\r\nThose who knew Sanz personally[13] have been left with the clear\r\nimpression that through the medium of Quevedo, Sanz poured forth his\r\ninvective against those that refused to recognize his own ability.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: I speak especially of Don Juan Perez de Guzman and Don\r\nJulio Nombela, both of whom have been kind enough to give me all the\r\ndata at their disposal.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the ultimate source, or rather the\r\ninspiration, of the play was the appeal to Sanz of the personality of\r\nQuevedo. There are other more tangible sources that may be briefly\r\nindicated. An important element in the plot is Queen Isabel's struggle\r\nto obtain from Olivares a certain letter which had been written in blood\r\nby the Conde de Villamediana and which would prove her fidelity to her\r\nhusband, Philip. The existence of such a valuable document is pure\r\ninvention. Villamediana's contemporaries are unanimous in saying that\r\nafter being stabbed he died almost instantly and that his only words\r\nwere \"Esto es hecho.\" The romantic circumstances of Villamediana's\r\nattachment to the queen had been rehearsed to the public only a few\r\nyears before the production of \"Don Francisco de Quevedo.\" In 1841 the\r\nDuke of Rivas had published his four ballads, \"Los Toros,\" \"Las Máscaras\r\ny Cañas,\" \"El Sarao,\" and \"Final,\" under the title \"El Conde de\r\nVillamediana.\" The affair then would be fresh in the minds of Sanz and\r\nhis public. Don Juan de Tassis y Peralta, Count of Villamediana, was\r\nborn in Lisbon in 1580, and was brought up in the court of Philip III.\r\nIn 1614 he served in Italy, and the end of 1618 found him again in\r\nMadrid, where he lived magnificently, indulging freely his tastes for\r\npaintings, jewels, and horses. His satirical pen, attacking even the\r\nDuke of Lerma and the royal confessor, Fray Luis de Aliaga, was the\r\ncause of his exile from Madrid in 1618. At the accession of Philip IV he\r\nwas recalled to Madrid and made a gentleman in waiting to the queen.\r\nFallen ministers and the favorites of Philip III continued to be marks\r\nfor his attacks. Olivares, the enemy of Villamediana and Doña Isabel,\r\nprobably brought his libels to the attention of Philip. On August 21,\r\n1622, as Villamediana was driving through the Calle Mayor, a man halted\r\nhis coach, and, as the count was descending, ran him through the heart.\r\nThe gossips of Madrid attributed the murder to Olivares, giving as his\r\nmotive his hatred and fear of Villamediana. Others laid the blame upon\r\nPhilip, whose jealousy had been aroused, they said, by Villamediana's\r\nmarked attentions to Doña Isabel.\r\n\r\nFurther historical material for the play Sanz took from two arraignments\r\nof the administration of Olivares published by Valladares. The use of\r\nthese sources by Sanz will be pointed out as briefly as possible. The\r\ncircumstances of the imprisonment of Doña Margarita in Ocaña, her flight\r\nto Madrid, and her subsequent treatment at the hands of Olivares are\r\npresented in detail in the \"Caída de su Privanza y Muerte del\r\nConde-Duque de Olivares, Gran Privado del Señor Rey Don Felipe IV, el\r\nGrande, con los motivos y no imaginada disposición de dicha Caída,\"[14]\r\nand in the \"Memorial de Don Francisco de Quevedo contra el Conde-Duque\r\nde Olivares. Dado al Rey Don Felipe Quarto.\"[15] According to the\r\naccount in the latter she had received no reply to her complaints\r\nagainst the evil conduct of Vasconcellos and the suicidal policy of\r\nOlivares toward the Duke of Braganza.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Sem. Erud._, III, pp. 1-62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Ibid., XV, pp. 215-245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: It should be noted here that Quevedo's journey to Lisbon\r\nto bring back the proofs of Margarita's story is an ingenious fiction\r\nconcocted by Sanz. In reality Quevedo was a prisoner in San Marcos de\r\nLeón.]\r\n\r\nThe interview between Olivares and the queen about the establishment of\r\nthe young Prince of the Asturias in separate apartments with an\r\nindependent household (Act II, scene ii) was evidently taken from the\r\n\"Memorial\" (p. 214) and from the \"Caída\" (p. 49). Says Philip, \"And why,\r\nConde-Duque, would he not be better off in the apartment that you\r\nyourself occupy? It is especially for the firstborn of the king, and is\r\nthe one in which my father and myself were when we were princes.\" There\r\nalso is mentioned the removal of the Count of Lemos, the Marquis of\r\nCastel Rodrigo, and Don Fernando de Borja from the palace.\r\n\r\nIn Act III, scene ii, Margarita laments the loss of Spanish possessions\r\nthrough the ineptitude of Olivares:\r\n\r\n                por él perdimos\r\n    a Esthin, Wiranzan y Dola,\r\n    y a más las Islas Terceras,\r\n    y el Ducado de Borgoña\r\n    y el Brasil y el Rosellón,\r\n    y Ormuz, Pernambuco y Hoa;\r\n    y no ha mucho Portugal...\r\n\r\nThe same catalogue of losses, even to the peculiar spelling of Hesdin\r\nand Bisanzón (Besançon), appears in the \"Caída.\"\r\n\r\nThe intensely dramatic episode of the presentation of the golden cup to\r\nOlivares as a memorial from Philip is founded upon fact.

The square in\r\nfront of the Iglesia de San Martín was in reality the Plazuela de las\r\nDescalzas. The present Plaza de Antón Martín, at the intersection of the\r\nCalle del León and the Calle de Atocha, is in quite another part of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe church of San Martín was built in the seventeenth century. Its\r\nrichness attracted the attention of the French soldiers in 1809, when it\r\nwas sacked and destroyed by them.\r\n\r\n=5-6.= In 1583 Philip II gave orders that no woman in all his kingdom,\r\nwhatever her state, quality, or condition, should go about with her face\r\ncovered (Nov. Recop., ley 8, t. 13, lib. vi). The same order went forth\r\nagain in 1593, 1610, and 1693. The prohibition was obviously to prevent\r\nscandal and intrigue.\r\n\r\n=32.= =mejoría=: Castilla early shows his scorn for the empty-headed\r\nsycophant Mendaña by thus punning on the word =mejoría=. Here, in addition\r\nto the meaning of 'advancement', it alludes to the exaggerated use by\r\nMendaña of the exclamation =mejor=.\r\n\r\n=47.= =Su excelencia=: the conde-duque de Olivares.\r\n\r\n=52.= =mejoreo=: another jibe at Mendaña, cf. l. 32. The suffix =-eo= is\r\ngenerally used to form nouns only from verbs in =-ear=.\r\n\r\n=66.= =no haya duelo ni quebranto=: 'let there be no dueling or damage\r\ndone.'\r\n\r\n=70.= =El de Guzmán=: Don Gaspar de Guzmán, conde-duque de Olivares.\r\n\r\n=103.= =La infanta Margarita=: cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=110.= =Ocaña=: an old town in the northeast corner of the province of\r\nToledo, not far from Aranjuez. During the Middle Ages it was a town of\r\nconsiderable importance. As late as the early years of the seventeenth\r\ncentury it was still a resort for the fashionables of Madrid.\r\n\r\n=134.= =la duquesa de Mantua=: cf. Historical Introduction. Mantua is a\r\nprovince that formed part of ancient Lombardy. The succession to the\r\nduchy of Mantua caused a bitter war. The legitimate heir was Charles,\r\nduke of Nevers. His heritage was disputed by Ferdinand and Cæsar\r\nGonzaga, dukes of Guastalla, and by the duke of Savoy. Charles caused\r\nMantua to be occupied by his son contrary to the wishes of the Emperor\r\nFerdinand II. France and Venice supported Charles and ousted the\r\nSavoyards and Spaniards who were besieging Casale (1629). In July, 1630,\r\nthe city of Mantua was taken and sacked by the imperial troops. At the\r\ndiet of Ratisbon the Emperor Ferdinand gave in, putting Charles in\r\npossession of his duchies. Spain at first refused to accept this\r\ndecision, but later, by the treaty of Cherasco (1631), recognized it.\r\n\r\n=139.= =Saboya=: Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy married Marguerite of Valois, a\r\nsister of Henry II of France. The son of this marriage, Charles Emmanuel\r\nI, married the infanta Catalina, daughter of Philip II of Spain. The\r\nambitions of Charles Emmanuel to extend his dominions westward were\r\nseverely punished by Henry IV in the treaty of Lyons (1601). Savoy\r\nmingled in most of the wars of the early part of the century. Charles\r\nEmmanuel's shifting politics were always guided by his desires of\r\naggrandizement.\r\n\r\n=153.= =el conde-duque=: not a legal title. When Philip IV made him duke of\r\nSan Lúcar, he should according to custom have dropped the lower title of\r\ncount of Olivares; but he asked leave to keep the title which was\r\nalready well known to the nation. Thenceforth he was popularly called\r\n\"the count-duke.\"\r\n\r\n=202.= =Villamediana=: cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=266.= =¿Conocéis?...=: i.e. =¿Conocéis ...?= In the Romance languages the\r\nsuspensive points take the place, for many purposes, of the dash in\r\nEnglish. The most authoritative usage is that when these points are used\r\nwith an exclamation or interrogation point, as here, they (like the dash\r\nin English) are put before the exclamation or interrogation point if\r\nthey mean that the sentence is broken off, but after it if they mean\r\nthat there is a break between this and the next sentence. But it is\r\ncommoner to put the exclamation or interrogation point invariably before\r\nthe suspensive points, as the comma in English is always put before the\r\ndash, regardless of the sense. When this is done, it expresses the sense\r\nrightly in most places, but there will generally be a considerable\r\nminority of places where the punctuation must be understood as if\r\ntransposed, i.e. as indicating an uncompleted sentence. Since Sanz, or\r\nhis printer, followed this more mechanical rule, it is followed in this\r\nedition; but the student must take care not to be misled by it.\r\n\r\n=303-306.= =Ya hace meses=, etc.: cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=336 ff.= Cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=434.= =cruz de Santiago=: a red cross to represent a sword with\r\nfleurs-de-lis at hilt and guard, on a field of white. The order of St.\r\nJames was founded in the twelfth century as a combatant order to fight\r\nthe Moors. Later membership in the order was purely honorary. It carried\r\nwith it an =encomienda= or estate from which income was derived.\r\n\r\nACTO II, STAGE DIRECTION. =el palacio del Buen Retiro=: built by Olivares\r\nto flatter the whims of Philip IV. It stood beyond what were then the\r\neastern limits of Madrid. Work on it was begun in 1621, and in 1632\r\nOlivares presented the keys of the new palace to his sovereign amidst\r\ngreat rejoicing. During the French occupation of Madrid after 1808 it\r\nwas used as a fortress by the troops of Napoleon. The palace and\r\nbuildings were destroyed later by the French. What were the palace\r\ngrounds now form the nucleus of the Parque del Retiro.\r\n\r\n=627-634.= An allusion to Philip's suspicion of Doña Isabel's guilt in the\r\naffair with Villamediana. Cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=687.= =ese escrito=: cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=707.= =Y con su propia sangre=: cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=765.= =van ya muchos años=: Villamediana was murdered in 1622.\r\n\r\n=782.= =el príncipe heredero=: Don Balthasar Carlos received a separate\r\nestablishment in 1643. A boy of rare promise, his early death in 1646\r\nwas a serious blow to the hopes of Philip and of the Spanish people.\r\n\r\n=793-800.= It was customary for members of the nobility to have lodgings\r\nin the palace, especially those who enjoyed honorary positions as\r\npersonal servants to the sovereign. In this passage no particular\r\nsignificance attaches to the names mentioned other than that their\r\nhostility to Olivares was the cause of their removal. For this episode\r\ncf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=926.= =letrilla=: a letrilla is usually divided into strophes at the end of\r\neach of which the central thought of the whole composition is repeated\r\nas a refrain. This form was effectively used by Quevedo as a vehicle for\r\nsatire.\r\n\r\n=928.= =al buen entendedor=: the whole proverb is \"Al buen entendedor, pocas\r\npalabras,\" or \"A buen entendedor, breve hablador.\" The English\r\nequivalent is \"A word to the wise is sufficient.\"\r\n\r\n=944.= It should be recalled that Quevedo, Act I, Scene XIII, had picked\r\nup by mistake Medina's cloak instead of his own.\r\n\r\n=1070.= Grana calls attention to the cross of St. James and congratulates\r\nQuevedo on receiving it.\r\n\r\n=1277-1292.= As the stage direction explains, Sanz has cleverly taken\r\neight lines from Quevedo's sonnet _A Una Nariz_, and introduced asides\r\nto Olivares. The sonnet continues:\r\n\r\n    Érase un espolón de una galera,\r\n    érase un pirámide de Egipto,\r\n    las doce tribus de narices era.\r\n    Érase un naricísimo infinito,\r\n    muchísima nariz, nariz tan fiera,\r\n    que en la cara de Anás fuera delito.\r\n\r\n=1281.= =una nariz sayón y escriba=: the two nouns =sayón= ('executioner') and\r\n=escriba= ('scribe,' 'notary') used as adjectives convey the idea that\r\nthis nose was a sharp one, even a deadly one. The notary with his\r\naffidavits was as much to be dreaded as the executioner himself.\r\n\r\n=1291.= =Ovidio Nasón más narizado=: the allusion is to the Latin poet\r\nPublius Ovidius Naso; the pun is on the word =Nasón= (Naso); _naso_ in\r\nLatin = =narizado=.\r\n\r\n=1445-1468.= Cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=1552.= =Esthin=: Hesdin, a fortified town near the English Channel, in\r\nArtois; taken by the French in 1639.--=Wiranzan=: probably Besançon in\r\nFranche-Comté.--=Dola=: Dôle, a fortified town, capital of Franche-Comté\r\ntill 1648.\r\n\r\n=1553.= =Islas Terceras=: the name given to the central group of the Azores;\r\nit may apply as well to the entire archipelago. Portuguese territory\r\nuntil 1582, it passed with Portugal to the control of Spain and was not\r\nrestored to Portugal until the mother country regained her independence.\r\n\r\n=1554.= =el Ducado de Borgoña=: an error; the _duchy_ of Burgundy, west of\r\nthe river Saône, had not been a Spanish possession. It was the _county_\r\nof Burgundy, east of the Saône, better known in English as\r\nFranche-Comté, that came to the Spanish crown from the house of Austria.\r\nIt was largely occupied by the French about 1643, though it was restored\r\nto Spain at the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648 and did not become\r\npermanently a part of France till thirty years later.\r\n\r\n=1555.= =el Brasil=: Brazil was a Portuguese possession until 1822. In\r\n1630-1644 the Dutch occupied the northern provinces almost down to the\r\ncapital, Bahia.--=el Rosellón=: Roussillon, north of the eastern end of\r\nthe Pyrenees, was formerly a dependency of the crown of Aragon. Louis\r\nXIII began its conquest in 1639 and concluded it in 1642.\r\n\r\n=1556.= =Ormuz=: a Portuguese trading station on the East India route until\r\n1622, when it was captured and destroyed by the Persians and English. It\r\nwas on the strait of the same name, which connects the Persian Gulf and\r\nthe Sea of Oman.--=Pernambuco=: a Brazilian state whose colonization dates\r\nfrom the second decade of the sixteenth century. The Dutch seized it in\r\n1630 and held it till 1654.--=Hoa=: for Goa, a Portuguese trading station\r\nin India.\r\n\r\n=1559.= =Braganza=: the house of Braganza was founded by John I of Portugal\r\nin the person of his illegitimate son Alfonso. The dukes of Braganza\r\nplayed important rôles in the history of Portugal during the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries. Tedosio II served Philip II faithfully as long\r\nas Portugal was a Spanish dependency. In 1630 his son John II succeeded\r\nhim, and in 1640 was proclaimed king of Portugal as John IV.\r\n\r\n=1560.= =Villaviciosa=: Villa Viçosa, a city of Portugal about twenty miles\r\nfrom Elvas. It is famous for its connection with the house of Braganza.\r\n\r\n=1587.= =las Salinas=: I am unable to identify this place.\r\n\r\n=1615-1616.= Mars and Bellona, the god and goddess of war in Latin\r\nmythology. Margarita and Quevedo are leading the attack on Olivares.\r\nWhile Quevedo is absent Margarita is idle.\r\n\r\n=1685.= =Éranse etc.=: the stereotyped manner of beginning a story. It has\r\nthe same touch of quaintness as the English \"once upon a time there\r\nwas,\" etc.\r\n\r\n=1837.= =tarantela=: the tarantella is a Neapolitan dance, particularly\r\nanimated and spirited. The sense of the passage is that Quevedo watches\r\nhis fellow mortals rush feverishly hither and thither with great stir of\r\nactivity, but accomplishing nothing of value.\r\n\r\n=1838.= This name originally was applied to a German dancing mania. Sanz\r\nuses it in its modern sense of a disease whose most conspicuous symptom\r\nis interference with the control of the muscles.\r\n\r\n=1882.= This line is faulty; two syllables are lacking.\r\n\r\n=1908.= Quevedo is even more famous for his satirical =romances= (_ballads_)\r\nthan for his letrillas and sonnets.\r\n\r\n=1926-1929.= Margarita here probably alludes to Quevedo's _Poesías\r\nMorales_, \"esto es que descubren y manifiestan las pasiones y costumbres\r\ndel hombre, procurándolas enmendar.\"\r\n\r\n=1938-1941.= These lines are taken from the first strophe of Quevedo's\r\n\"Elogio al Duque de Lerma, Canción Pindárica.\"\r\n\r\n=1977.= Sicily was at this time still ruled by a Spanish viceroy.\r\n\r\n=1979.= Palermo, a city on the north coast of Sicily, formerly the capital\r\nof the kingdom of Sicily and now the capital of the province of Palermo.\r\n\r\n=1989-1990.= These lines are taken from one of Quevedo's cold and highly\r\nartificial love sonnets, \"Musa\" IV, VII.\r\n\r\n=2030.= =ese altivo Girón=: cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=2036-2043.= Sanz quotes the two quatrains of Quevedo's sonnet \"Memoria\r\ninmortal de Don Pedro Girón, Duque de Osuna, muerto en la prisión.\" The\r\nconcluding tercets are inferior to the quatrains.\r\n\r\n=2048.= =los Guzmanes en Tarifa=: the allusion is to Alonso Pérez de Guzmán,\r\ncalled =el Bueno= (1256-1309). In the reign of Sancho IV of Castile,\r\nAlonso Pérez was entrusted with the defense of Tarifa against the Moors.\r\nTarifa was besieged by the traitorous infante Don Juan at the head of an\r\narmy of Moors and adventurers. Assaults proving fruitless, Don Juan\r\nsummoned Guzmán to a parley on the walls of the city, where he told him\r\nthat if Tarifa were not immediately surrendered, the son of the gallant\r\ndefender would be put to death before his eyes. The answer of Alonso\r\nPérez was to fling down the weapon with which his son should be\r\nmurdered. Don Juan promptly dispatched the boy and cast his head within\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\n=2153.= This line is faulty; one syllable is lacking.\r\n\r\n=2173-2175.= Blue symbolizes perseverance, loyalty and recompense; while\r\nblack, as the symbol of grief and mourning, would signify despair.\r\n\r\n=2186.= =al Escorial=: the Real Sitio or Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo del\r\nEscorial lies thirty-one miles northwest of Madrid. It is traditionally\r\nbelieved that during the battle of St. Quentin on St. Lawrence's day\r\n(Aug. 10), 1557, Philip vowed that he would build a monastery and\r\ndedicate it to St. Lawrence in order to make amends for the destruction\r\nby Spanish artillery of a church that bore his name. However, as\r\nEmmanuel Philibert of Savoy won the battle and Philip himself was not\r\npresent, we may suppose that the Escorial was built rather to fulfill\r\nPhilip's promise to his father Charles V that he would build a suitable\r\ntomb as a final resting-place for the remains of the latter and of his\r\nwife. In modern times the Escorial has been little used as a palace by\r\nthe kings of Spain. It is now a monastery in the care of Augustinian\r\nmonks.\r\n\r\n=2242.= Cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=2247.= Cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=2255.= =enmudecerá Talía=: Thalia is the muse of comedy; hence the passage\r\nwould mean 'your laughing satirical tongue will be silenced.'\r\n\r\n=2256-2257.= Cf. Historical Introduction.\r\n\r\n=2315.= Mendaña gives the explanation in the following scene, cf. l. 2346\r\nand note.\r\n\r\n=2320.= Quevedo puns on the word =labores= 'embroidery' and the usual sense\r\nof 'labor, work.'\r\n\r\n=2327.= =en Toledo=: an allusion to the hospital for the insane at Toledo,\r\ncalled =la Casa del Nuncio=.\r\n\r\n=2340.= =el consejo de Castilla=: the Consejo de la Real Cámara or Cámara de\r\nCastilla was an outgrowth of the reorganized Consejo Real of Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella. It was established in 1588 by Philip II, who required that\r\nits members be persons chosen for their prudence, piety, and zeal. Its\r\nprincipal functions were to look after the royal revenues, to fill\r\necclesiastical benefices, and to administer justice in Castile, Navarre,\r\nand the Canary Islands.--For this action by the Consejo cf. Historical\r\nIntroduction.\r\n\r\n=2346.= =Fuenterrabía=: the siege by the French began in July, 1638. The\r\ntown was supplied with provisions by sea from San Sebastian until a\r\nfleet commanded by the archbishop of Bordeaux put an end to this source\r\nof supplies with heavy loss to the Spaniards. Meanwhile a force was\r\nbeing prepared to attack the French in their camp. The attack was\r\nsuccessful and the rout of the French was complete.\r\n\r\n=2395.= =del Corpus=: Corpus Christi, the day upon which the institution of\r\nthe Holy Eucharist is commemorated. It is observed in Roman Catholic\r\ncountries with great pomp and ceremony.\r\n\r\n=2511.= =Lo=: not the paper, but, as line 2513 shows, the proposition that\r\nthe paper should go in.\r\n\r\n=2547.= =Al fin me estrellé en la roca=: 'at last I have met my fate.'\r\nQuevedo had always affected scorn for women. Sanz ignores the fact of\r\nQuevedo's marriage.\r\n\r\n=2565.= =¿quién?...=: the full form of the question is 'which will prove the\r\nstronger?'\r\n\r\n=2647.= It was a breach of etiquette for Quevedo to be seated without\r\npermission in the presence of Olivares.\r\n\r\n=2658.= =ya no quitáis ni ponéis=: this is a reminiscence of Bertrand du\r\nGuesclin's \"Ni quito ni pongo rey, pero ayudo a mi señor.\" Du Guesclin\r\nwith his White Companies came to the aid of Enrique de Trastamara in\r\nthe latter's rebellion against his half-brother Pedro el Cruel. Pedro,\r\nbesieged in the castle of Montiel, tried to save himself from Enrique by\r\nmaking terms with Du Guesclin, but he was betrayed into the presence of\r\nEnrique. In the struggle that necessarily ensued the two brothers fell\r\nto the ground locked in each other's arms. Things were going badly for\r\nEnrique when Du Guesclin interfered to give Enrique a chance to dispatch\r\nPedro with his dagger (1369).\r\n\r\n=2693.= =la carta de Urías=: in order to have greater opportunity to indulge\r\nhis passion for Bathsheba, King David sent her husband Uriah to the\r\nsiege of Rabbah, and at the same time sent a letter giving orders that\r\nUriah be stationed in the place of greatest danger.
