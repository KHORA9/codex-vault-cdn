For such\r\nstudents the many editions published in Spain and elsewhere have been\r\nperhaps sufficient, but for the much larger number who never reach the\r\nadvanced literary classes an annotated edition is needed. That this play\r\noffers excellent material for the work of more elementary courses in the\r\nschools and colleges has long been the opinion of the present editor;\r\nand that it has not already found a place among the Spanish texts\r\npublished in this country is difficult to understand. The old legend of\r\nTeruel, the embodiment of pure and constant love, is one that might well\r\nbe expected to make a strong appeal to the youth of any country; the\r\nsimple and direct presentation given to the legend by Hartzenbusch and\r\nthe comparative freedom from textual difficulties, as the result of the\r\ncareful revisions of the play by its scholarly author, bring it within\r\nthe range of the understanding and appreciation of students who have\r\nstudied Spanish one year in college or two years in high school, if it\r\nis put before them in a properly prepared edition.\r\n\r\nThe editor has kept in mind this class of students in the preparation of\r\nthe Introduction, Notes, and Vocabulary. To those who consider the\r\nIntroduction disproportionately long, the excuse is given that this will\r\nbe the first Romantic play read by many students, and that if they are\r\nto understand it and appreciate its fine literary qualities, they must\r\nbe enabled to view it in its proper historical perspective. It is to be\r\nhoped that this edition may serve as a safe approach to the systematic\r\nstudy, of the Romantic Movement in Spanish literature.\r\n\r\nThe text of the play is that of the annotated edition of Dr. Adolf\r\nKressner, Leipsic, 1887 (_Bibliothek Spanischer Schriftsteller_), and is\r\nthe same as the one contained in the definitive collection of the plays\r\nof Hartzenbusch, _Teatro_, Madrid, 1888-1892, Vol. I, pages 7-130\r\n(_Colección de Escritores Castellanos_).\r\n\r\nThe indebtedness of the editor to Professor E.C.

Constancy in love has inspired many writers and has\r\ngiven undying fame to many legends and traditions. Among the famous\r\nlovers that have passed into legend and that stand as the embodiment of\r\nconstant love in different ages and in different countries,--Pyramus and\r\nThisbe, Hero and Leander, Tristam and Isolde, Romeo and Juliet,--are to\r\nbe found Marsilla and Isabel. These _Lovers of Teruel_, as constant as\r\nany of the others, are especially notable because of the purity of their\r\nlove and because of the absence of violence in their sudden departure\r\nfrom this life. Disappointed love, desperate grief at separation, was\r\nthe only cause of their death.\r\n\r\nThe old city of Teruel, founded by the Aragonese in the latter half of\r\nthe twelfth century at the junction of the Guadalaviar and the Alfambra\r\nas a stronghold in the territory recently recovered from the Moors, was\r\nthe fitting scene for the action of the legend.... The pioneer life of\r\nthe city, the depth of sentiment and singleness of purpose of its\r\nAragonese inhabitants, the crusading spirit that carried to victory the\r\narmies of Peter II of Aragón and his more famous son, James the\r\nConqueror, lend probability to a legend that would ordinarily be\r\nconsidered highly improbable from the point of view of historical\r\nauthenticity. Stripped of the fantastic details that have gathered about\r\nit in the many literary treatments given to it by Spanish writers, the\r\nlegend may be briefly told. In Teruel, at the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century, lived Juan Diego Martínez Garcés de Marsilla and\r\nIsabel de Segura. They had loved each other from childhood, but when it\r\nbecame a question of marriage, Isabel's father opposed the union\r\nbecause of the young man's lack of material resources and because a\r\nwealthy suitor, Rodrigo de Azagra, had presented himself for the hand of\r\nhis daughter. All that the entreaties of the lovers could gain from him\r\nwas the promise that if Marsilla went to the wars, gained fame and\r\nriches, and returned before a certain day, he would receive Isabel in\r\nmarriage. This Marsilla did; but unfortunately he was unable to return\r\nuntil just after the expiration of the time set. When he reached Teruel,\r\nhe found Isabel married to the wealthy rival. Disappointed in their\r\nhopes after so many years of constant love and continual struggle\r\nagainst adversity, Marsilla died of grief, and Isabel soon followed him;\r\nseparated in life by cruel fate, they were united in death. Buried in\r\nthe same tomb, they were later disinterred, and their mummified remains\r\nmay now be seen in the old church of San Pedro in Teruel.\r\n\r\n#II. Authenticity of the Legend#. The earliest references that have\r\nyet been found to the legend belong to the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, that is, more than three centuries after the supposed death of\r\nthe lovers. In 1555, when the church of San Pedro in Teruel was\r\nundergoing some repairs, two bodies, supposedly those of Marsilla and\r\nIsabel, were discovered in one tomb in a remarkably good state of\r\npreservation. They were reburied at the foot of the altar in the chapel\r\nof Saints Cosme and Damian, and the story of the unfortunate lovers\r\nbegan to spread far and wide. By the end of the century it was\r\napparently widely known and attracted considerable attention to the old\r\ncity of Teruel. When Philip III of Spain was journeying to Valencia in\r\n1599 he was induced to turn aside to visit the church of San Pedro. In\r\nthe official account of his journey, \"Jornada de Su Majestad Felipe III\r\ny Alteza la Infanta Doña Isabel, desde Madrid, a casarse el Rey con la\r\nReyna Doña Margarita, y su Alteza con el Archiduque Alberto,\" the story\r\nof the legend as then generally accepted is related so succinctly that\r\nit may well be quoted here: \"En la iglesia de San Pedro, en la capilla\r\nde San Cosme y San Damián, de la dicha ciudad, está la sepultura de los\r\nAmantes que llaman de Teruel; y dicen eran un mancebo y una doncella que\r\nse querían mucho, ella rica y él al contrario; y como él pidiese por\r\nmujer la doncella y por ser pobre no se la diesen, se determinó a ir por\r\nel mundo a adquerir hacienda y ella aguardarle ciertos años, al cabo de\r\nlos cuales y dos o tres días más, volvió rico y halló que aquella noche\r\nse casaba la doncella. Tuvo trazas de meterse debajo de su cama y a\r\nmedia noche le pidió un abrazo, dándose a conocer; ella le dijo que no\r\npodía por no ser ya suya, y él murió luego al punto. Lleváronle a\r\nenterrar, y ella fué al entierro, y cuando le querían echar en la\r\nsepultura, se arrimó a la ataúd y quedó allí muerta; y así los\r\nenterraron juntos en una sepultura, sabido el caso.\"\r\n\r\nSeventeen years later a long epic poem by the secretary of the city\r\ncouncil of Teruel, Juan Yagüe de Salas, aroused much discussion as to\r\nthe authenticity of the legend. In 1619 the bodies were again exhumed\r\nand in the coffin of one of them were found written the words \"Éste es\r\nDon Diego Juan Martínez de Marsilla\"; also a document, \"papel de letra\r\nmuy antigua,\" giving the story in detail. This document disappeared, but\r\nthe copy that Juan Yagüe claimed to have made may be seen in the\r\narchives of the church of San Pedro or in the transcription published in\r\nthe _Semanario Pintoresco_ for the week ending Feb. 5, 1837 (Vol. II,\r\npages 45-47). The genuineness of the document and its copy is very\r\ndoubtful. The first paragraph shows some linguistic peculiarities of old\r\nAragonese; but these gradually disappear, until there is little left in\r\nthe language to differentiate it from that of the good notary public and\r\npoet, Juan Yagüe, who was so anxious to prove authenticity for the\r\nlegend treated in his poem. Although there is no reliable evidence that\r\nthe bodies exhumed in 1555 and again in 1619 were those of Marsilla and\r\nIsabel, the church of San Pedro has held them in special reverence.\r\nThey attract many admirers to the old city on the Guadalaviar and the\r\ntourist who expresses incredulity when shown the remains of the lovers\r\nbecomes thereby _persona non grata_ in Teruel.\r\n\r\nFor three centuries the controversy has continued and has resulted in\r\nthe spilling of much ink. The most complete and authoritative study of\r\nthe sources and growth of the legend is that of the eminent scholar\r\nCotarelo y Mori _(Sobre el origen y desarrollo de la leyenda de Los\r\nAmantes de Teruel_, 2d edition, 1907). His conclusions support the\r\ntheory that the legend is the result of the localization in Teruel of\r\nthe story of the unfortunate Florentine lovers, Girolamo and Salvestra,\r\nas related by Boccaccio in his _Decameron_, Book IV, Novel 8. He refutes\r\nthe arguments advanced by the supporters of the authenticity of the\r\nlegend, calls attention to the suspicious nature of all the documents,\r\nand maintains the thesis that Boccaccio's story found its way into Spain\r\ntoward the end of the fourteenth century and took the form of the legend\r\nof the _Lovers of Teruel_ about the middle of the sixteenth century, at\r\nwhich time it first appeared definitely in Spanish literature. The\r\nmajority of literary critics and historians accept Cotarelo y Mori's\r\nconclusions; others, however, refuse to give up the historic basis of\r\nthe legend. They cannot deny, of course, the evident similarity of the\r\nstories; they explain it by saying that the story of the constant lovers\r\nwho died in Teruel in 1217 was carried to Italy by Aragonese soldiers or\r\nmerchants, was heard by the Italian novelist, and used by him as the\r\nbasis for his story of Girolamo and Salvestra.\r\n\r\n#III. The Legend in Spanish Literature.# Very few of the famous\r\nlegends of the world rest upon documentary evidence, and the fact that\r\nthe legend of the _Lovers of Teruel_ lacks historic proof has had little\r\ninfluence upon its popularity. It has been productive of much\r\nliterature, the extent of which is indicated by the two hundred or more\r\ntitles contained in the bibliography[l] published by Domingo Gascón y\r\nGuimbao in 1907. Of the many poems, plays, and novels inspired by the\r\nlegend only the most noteworthy can be mentioned here. The oldest\r\nliterary treatment is apparently that of Pedro de Alventosa, written\r\nabout the middle of the sixteenth century, _Historia lastimosa y sentida\r\nde los tiernos amantes Marcilla y Segura_. This was followed in 1566 by\r\na Latin poem of about five hundred lines by Antonio de Serón, published\r\nin 1907 by Gascón y Guimbao, with a Spanish translation and an excellent\r\nbibliography. In 1581 the legend was given dramatic treatment by Rey de\r\nArtieda, who followed the story in its essential elements but modernized\r\nthe action by placing it in the time of Charles V, only forty-six years\r\nearlier than the publication of the play. It has little literary value,\r\nbut is important because of its influence on later dramatists. Passing\r\nover various treatments of the theme that serve merely to indicate its\r\ngrowing popularity, we come to the pretentious epic poem of Juan Yagüe\r\nde Salas in twenty-six cantos, _Los Amantes de Teruel, Epopeya trágica_,\r\nin which, besides adding many fantastic details to the legend, the\r\nauthor presented much extraneous matter bearing upon the general history\r\nof Teruel. Because of this widely known poem and the growing popularity\r\nof the _Lovers_, two dramatists of the Golden Age, Tirso de Molina and\r\nPérez de Montalbán, gave it their attention. _Los Amantes de Teruel_ of\r\nthe great Tirso de Molina, published in 1635, is disappointing,\r\nconsidering the dramatic ability of the author; it contains passages of\r\ndramatic effectiveness but is weak in construction. As in Rey de\r\nArtieda's play, the action is placed in the sixteenth century; Marsilla\r\ntakes part in the famous expedition of Charles V against the Moors in\r\nTunis, saves the Emperor's life, and, richly rewarded, returns, too\r\nlate, to claim the promised bride. It is a better play than that of\r\nArtieda, but is itself surpassed by Montalbán's play of three years\r\nlater. Although he was far from possessing the dramatic genius of Tirso,\r\nMontalbán succeeded in giving the story the form that it was to maintain\r\non the stage for two centuries. Frequent performances and many editions\r\nof his play, as well as many other literary treatments and references\r\nthat might be cited, attest the continued popularity of the legend.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Los Amantes de Teruel, Bibliografía de los Amantes_.\r\nDomingo Gascón y Guimbao, Madrid, 1907.]\r\n\r\nFinally, in the early days of Romanticism, it assumed the dramatic form\r\nthat has remained most popular down to the present day. On the\r\nnineteenth of January of the year 1837 the theatergoing people of Madrid\r\nwere moved to vociferous applause by a new treatment of the old theme,\r\nand a new star of the literary firmament was recognized in the person of\r\nJuan Eugenio Hartzenbusch. In his dramatic masterpiece Hartzenbusch\r\neclipsed all the other plays that have dealt with the legend, and more\r\nthan twenty editions stand as proof of its continued popularity. Besides\r\nthese many editions of the play, numerous novels, poems, and operas have\r\nappeared from time to time. For the most complete bibliography down to\r\n1907 the reader is again referred to that of the official historian of\r\nTeruel, Gascón y Guimbao. We must now turn our attention to the author\r\nof the best dramatic treatment of the legend.\r\n\r\n#IV. Life of Hartzenbusch#. Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch, born in 1806,\r\nwas the only son of a German cabinet-maker who had wandered to Spain\r\nfrom his home near Cologne, married a Spanish girl, and opened up a shop\r\nin Madrid. The son inherited from his German father and Spanish mother\r\ntraits of character that were exemplified later in his life and\r\nwritings. From his father he received a fondness for meditation,\r\nconscientious industry in acquiring sound scholarship, and the patience\r\nneeded for the continual revision of his plays; from his mother came his\r\nardent imagination and love of literature. Childhood and youth were for\r\nhim a period of disappointment and struggle against adversity. Less than\r\ntwo years old when his mother died after a short period of insanity\r\ncaused by the sight of bloodshed in the turbulent streets of Madrid in\r\n1808, he was left to the care of a brooding father who had little\r\nsympathy with his literary aspirations, but who did wish to give him the\r\nbest education he could afford. He received a common school education\r\nand was permitted to spend the four years from 1818 to 1822 in the\r\nCollege of San Isidro. As a result of the political troubles in Spain in\r\n1823, the father's business, never very prosperous, fell away and the\r\nson had to leave college to help in the workshop. He was thus compelled\r\nto spend a large part of his time in making furniture, although his\r\ninclination was toward literature.\r\n\r\nHis leisure was given to study and to the acquirement of a practical\r\nknowledge of the dramatic art, gained for the most part from books,\r\nbecause of his father's dislike of the theater and because of the lack\r\nof money for any unnecessary expenditure. He translated several French\r\nand Italian plays, adapted others to Spanish conditions, and recast\r\nvarious _comedias_ of the _Siglo de Oro_, with a view to making them\r\nmore suitable for presentation. He tried his hand also at original\r\nproduction and succeeded in getting some of his plays on the stage, only\r\nto have them withdrawn almost immediately. Undiscouraged by repeated\r\nfailure, he continued studying and writing, more determined than ever to\r\nbecome a successful dramatist and thus realize the ambition that was\r\nkindled in him by the first dramatic performance that he had witnessed\r\nwhen he had already reached manhood.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his marriage in 1830 he was still helping his ailing and\r\ndespondent father in the workshop; more interested undoubtedly in his\r\nliterary pursuits, but ever faithful to the call of duty. Until success\r\nas a dramatist made it possible for him to gain a living for his family\r\nby literature, he continued patiently his manual labor. At his father's\r\ndeath he closed the workshop and for a short time became dependent for\r\na livelihood on stenography, with which he had already eked out the\r\nslender returns from the labor of his hands.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, during these last years of apprenticeship in which\r\nHartzenbusch was gaining complete mastery of his art by continual study\r\nand practice, the literary revolution known as Romanticism was making\r\nrapid progress. The death of the despotic Ferdinand VII in 1833 removed\r\nthe restraint that had been imposed upon literature as well as upon\r\npolitical ideas. The theories of the French and English Romanticists\r\nwere penetrating Spanish literary circles, to be taken up eagerly by the\r\nyounger dramatists; political exiles of high social and literary\r\nprestige, such as Martínez de la Rosa and the Duque de Rivas, were\r\nreturning to Spain with plays and poems composed according to the new\r\ntheories; the natural reaction from the logical, unemotional ideals of\r\nthe Classicists was developing conditions favorable to the revolution.\r\nThe first year of the struggle between the two schools of literature,\r\n1834, gave the Romanticists two important victories in the _Conjuración\r\nde Venecia_ of Martinez de la Rosa, and the _Macías_ of José de Larra,\r\ntwo plays that show clearly Romantic tendencies but that avoid an abrupt\r\nbreak with the Classical theories. They served to prepare the way for\r\nthe thoroughly Romantic play of the Duque de Rivas, _Don Álvaro o la\r\nfuerza del sino_, a magnificent, though disordered, drama that gained\r\nfor the Romanticists a decisive victory in 1835, a victory over\r\nClassicism in Spain similar to that gained in Paris five years earlier\r\nby the famous _Hernani_ of Victor Hugo, leader of the French\r\nRomanticists. In 1836 the equally successful performance of _El\r\nTrovador_, the Romantic play of García Gutiérrez, confirmed the victory\r\ngained by the Romanticists with _Don Álvaro_, and gave clear indication\r\nthat the literary revolution was complete. The temper of the time was\r\ndecidedly Romantic, and the wholehearted applause that resounded through\r\nthe Teatro del Príncipe on the night of Jan. 19, 1837, at the first\r\nperformance of _Los Amantes de Teruel_ put an end to the long and\r\nlaborious apprenticeship of Hartzenbusch.\r\n\r\nA few days later the warm reception given the play and its continued\r\npopularity were justified in a remarkable piece of dramatic criticism by\r\nthe rival playwright and keen literary critic, José de Larra, known\r\nbetter by his journalistic pen-name, Fígaro, and greatly feared by his\r\ncontemporaries for his mordant criticism and stinging satire. In the\r\nopening words of his review of the play, we may see the highly favorable\r\nattitude of the critic and realize the suddenness of the fame that came\r\nto Hartzenbusch. \"Venir a aumentar el número de los vivientes, ser un\r\nhombre más donde hay tantos hombres, oír decir de sí: 'Es un tal\r\nfulano,' es ser un árbol más en una alameda. Pero pasar cinco o seis\r\nlustros oscuro y desconocido, y llegar una noche entre otras, convocar a\r\nun pueblo, hacer tributaria su curiosidad, alzar una cortina, conmover\r\nel corazón, subyugar el juicio, hacerse aplaudir y aclamar, y oír al día\r\nsiguiente de sí mismo al pasar por una calle o por el Prado: 'Aquél es\r\nel escritor de la comedia aplaudida,' eso es algo; es nacer; es devolver\r\nal autor de nuestros días por un apellido oscuro un nombre claro; es dar\r\nalcurnia a sus ascendientes en vez de recibirla de ellos.\"[2] Other\r\ncontemporary reviews were just as favorable, and all expressed with\r\nFígaro great hopes in the career of a dramatist that had thus begun with\r\nan acknowledged masterpiece. The _Semanario Pintoresco_, for example, a\r\nliterary magazine in its second year of publication, ended its review of\r\nthe play with these words: \"El joven que, saliendo de la oscuridad del\r\ntaller de un artesano, se presenta en el mundo literario con los Amantes\r\nde Teruel por primera prueba de su talento, hace concebir al teatro\r\nespañol la fundada esperanza de futuros días de gloria, y de verse\r\nelevado a la altura que un día ocupó en la admiración del mundo\r\ncivilizado.\" (Feb. 5, 1837.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Obras completas de Fígaro._ Paris, 1889. Vol. III, page\r\n187.]\r\n\r\nThus encouraged by popular applause and by the enthusiastic praise of\r\nliterary critics, Hartzenbusch produced at varying intervals many\r\nexcellent plays, but none of them surpassed or even equaled his _Amantes\r\nde Teruel_. Many of them, characterized by careful workmanship, dramatic\r\neffectiveness, and fine literary finish, are well worth studying, and\r\ndeserve more attention than can be given them here. They offer all kinds\r\nof drama: tragedies such as _Doña Mencía_, in which the exaggerations of\r\nRomanticism are given free rein; historical plays, in which striking\r\nincidents in Spanish history or legend are given dramatic treatment;\r\nfantastic plays, such as _La redoma encantada_, in which magic plays an\r\nimportant part; comedies of character and manners, such as _La coja y el\r\nencogido_, in which contemporary life found humorous presentation. The\r\nbest of them may be read in the three volumes published in the\r\nwell-known series _Colección de Escritores Castellanos_. For literary\r\ncriticism the student is referred to the books mentioned later in the\r\nbibliography.\r\n\r\nThe love of study grew stronger in Hartzenbusch as the opportunity to\r\ndevote himself to it became greater, so that after he had had several\r\nplays presented with considerable success, scholarship began to absorb\r\nmore and more of his time and the intervals between plays began to\r\nlengthen. Literary criticism, editorial work in connection with new\r\neditions of the Spanish classics, his duties as assistant and, later,\r\nchief librarian of the Biblioteca Nacional, these, with the production\r\nfrom time to time of a new play, made him a well-known figure in the\r\nliterary life of Madrid. His was the quiet life of the modern man of\r\nletters, to whom the incidents of greatest interest are of the\r\nintellectual order: the production of a new play, the publication of a\r\nnew book of literary or scholarly value, the discovery of an old\r\nmanuscript or the announcement of a new theory, the admission of a new\r\nmember to the Spanish Academy. Serenely tolerant in his outlook upon\r\nlife, of gentle disposition and ready sympathy, unaffectedly modest,\r\nindifferent to the accumulation of property beyond the needs of his\r\nsimple mode of living, conscientious in the performance of all his\r\nduties, he retained to the end of his life the personal esteem of his\r\nmany friends. When death put an end in 1880 to the long illness that\r\nsaddened the last years of his life, his mortal remains were conducted\r\nto the tomb with all due ceremony by the Spanish Academy, to which\r\nmembership had been granted him in 1847 as a recognition of his\r\nexcellent work as dramatist and scholar.\r\n\r\nThe productivity of Hartzenbusch, as well as his versatility, would be\r\nremarkable in any country but Spain. The _Bibliografía de Hartzenbusch_,\r\nprepared by his son and published in 1900,[3] stands as proof of the\r\ngreat extent and diversity of his productions; four hundred pages are\r\nneeded for the bibliographical data connected with his many publications\r\nand for a few extracts from his unpublished writings. Hundreds of titles\r\nof dramas, poems, addresses, essays, literary criticism, scholarly\r\ncommentaries, indicate the versatility of his talent and his tireless\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Bibliografía de Hartzenbusch_. Eugenio Hartzenbusch.\r\nMadrid, 1900.]\r\n\r\n#V. Hartzenbusch's Treatment of the Legend.# Apparently Hartzenbusch\r\nhad given much study and thought to the famous legend of the _Lovers of\r\nTeruel_. At first it was his intention to use it in an historical novel,\r\nbut only the first few pages of this have been preserved (_Bibliografía\r\nde Hartzenbusch_). Believing that the legend could be better treated in\r\ndramatic form, he applied himself enthusiastically to the construction\r\nof the play in accordance with the new theories that were becoming\r\npopular, and had it ready for production when a copy of José de Larra's\r\n_Macías_ came into his hands. What was his astonishment to find that the\r\nplot of his play was so similar to that of _Macías_ that no one would be\r\nlikely to accept the similarity as a mere coincidence. Patiently he\r\nreconstructed it and had it published in 1836, if the date on the title\r\npage of the oldest edition is to be accepted as accurate.[4] If\r\npublished in 1836, the author remained in obscurity until the first\r\nperformance of the play, January 19 of the following year, made him\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Los Amantes de Teruel_, drama en cinco actos en prosa y\r\nverso por Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch. Madrid. Imprenta de D. José María\r\nRepullés. 1836.]\r\n\r\nMany difficulties beset the dramatist in the construction of the play.\r\nThe legend that served as plot was already known to all, so that the\r\nelement of suspense could not be used to any great extent. Moreover, the\r\nclimax was not in itself dramatic; the death of two lovers through grief\r\nat separation, pathetic though it be, lacked the tragic element of other\r\nsimilar stories in which death resulted from violence. The _dénouement_,\r\nthe probability of which would not be generally accepted, had to be\r\nretained in the treatment of a legend so widely known, a legend in which\r\nthe essential originality consisted in this very improbability. Careful\r\npreparation throughout the whole play was needed, then, for this\r\nimprobable _dénouement_, pathetic, rather than tragic; dramatic\r\nincidents had to be supplied by the author's own inventiveness, the\r\ncharacters had to be carefully delineated, the motivation carefully\r\nconsidered. How successfully the author was able to overcome these\r\ndifficulties, with what dramatic skill he was able to succeed where\r\ndramatists such as Tirso de Molina and Montalbán were only partially\r\nsuccessful, careful study of the play will reveal.\r\n\r\nThe play as given in this edition differs in many ways from the play as\r\nfirst presented in 1837. More than once the author returned to it, and\r\nthe numerous editions needed to supply the popular and continuous demand\r\ngave him the opportunity to revise it and give it the most artistic\r\nfinish of which he was capable. Changed literary conditions after\r\nRomanticism had run its course are reflected in the more sober dress of\r\nthe revised play; there are reflected in it, too, the greater\r\nrestraint, the more scholarly and critical attention to character\r\ndelineation and literary finish befitting a man who had passed from the\r\nwarm impulsiveness of youth to the calm rationality of middle age. The\r\nstudent who takes the trouble to compare the text of this edition with\r\nthat of the first will see many changes: the five acts are reduced to\r\nfour; some of the prose scenes are now in poetic form; the diction is\r\nmuch improved generally and obscure passages are made clear; some\r\nchanges in motivation are to be noted, especially in the scenes leading\r\nup to the voluntary marriage of Isabel with Azagra; the mother's\r\ncharacter is notably ennobled. On the whole, the play has gained by\r\nthese revisions; what it has lost in freshness and spontaneity has been\r\nmore than counterbalanced by the more careful delineation of character,\r\nimproved motivation of action, correctness of diction, and literary\r\nfinish. The play in its first form is undoubtedly a better example of\r\nRomanticism in all its phases, its tendencies toward exaggeration, its\r\ncrudities of thought and expression, combined with qualities unsurpassed\r\nin any other period of literature; in its revised form it is a more\r\nartistic production, is still a Romantic play, and one of the best in\r\nSpanish literature.\r\n\r\n#VI. Romanticism.# Generally speaking, an author belongs to his own\r\nage and country, is moved by the prevalent ideas and sentiments; his\r\noutlook upon life is similar to that of the majority of his\r\ncontemporaries. Ordinarily then, a piece of literature of a past age is\r\nunderstood and fully appreciated only by the student who is able to view\r\nit in its proper historical perspective, to see it through the eyes of\r\nthose for whom it was written. Especially is this true of Romantic\r\nliterature, the production of ardent and youthful enthusiasts who found\r\nthemselves suddenly emancipated from the rigid rules and formalism of\r\nFrench pseudo-Classicism of the eighteenth century. The tendency in\r\nliterature, as in political and social life, is to pass in a pendulum\r\nswing from one extreme to the other, so that to appreciate the fine and\r\nenduring qualities of Romantic literature and to make due allowance for\r\nits exaggerations and other apparent faults, the student must know\r\nsomething of the Romantic movement and of the Classicism that\r\nimmediately preceded it. Moreover, his purpose in reading a literary\r\nmasterpiece is not merely to understand and appreciate it in itself, but\r\nalso to gain through it some understanding of the age or literary\r\nmovement of which it is a representative. In order, then, that _Los\r\nAmantes de Teruel_ may be more fully appreciated as a dramatic\r\nmasterpiece, and in order that through it the student may come to a\r\nfuller understanding of Romanticism, his attention is now directed to\r\nthe essential characteristics of this important literary movement.\r\n\r\nRomanticism in Spanish literature is the name given to the literary\r\nrevolt that began about 1830 against pseudo-Classicism. A similar revolt\r\nhad already freed the other literatures of Europe, so that the many\r\nSpanish exiles who had been forced to seek refuge for political reasons\r\nin England or on the Continent there became familiar with the new ideas\r\nin literature. Ardent converts to the new literary ideals, these\r\npolitical exiles, when permitted to return to Spain at the death of the\r\ndespotic Ferdinand VII in 1833, became the leaders in a literary\r\nrevolution that soon swept away all opposition. The logical reaction\r\nfrom the rigid rules and formalism, new ideas in political and social\r\nlife weakened opposition so rapidly and effectively that the Romantic\r\npoetry and plays of the Duque de Rivas, Espronceda, García Gutiérrez,\r\nHartzenbusch, and others found a ready and enthusiastic welcome.\r\n\r\nIn the comparison that is to be made of Romanticism and Classicism,\r\n_romantic_ and _classic_ are to be used in their technical, literary\r\nsense. As ordinarily used, _romantic_ means the extreme opposite of\r\nprosaic or commonplace; in literary history, Romantic is used to\r\ndescribe the movement known as Romanticism. Classic, in its oldest and\r\nordinary acceptation, means the best of its class or kind; in its\r\nliterary sense, _classic_, or _classical_, is usually applied to the\r\ntype of literature that harmonized so completely with eighteenth century\r\nrationalism, the Classicism, or rather pseudo-Classicism, which,\r\nenthroned in France, ruled all literary Europe until the closing years\r\nof the century. In the following comparison, Classic, Classicist, and\r\nClassicism are the opposites of Romantic, Romanticist, and Romanticism.\r\n\r\nRomanticism, in its general application to all kinds of literature and\r\nto the literatures of all countries where it made itself effectively\r\nfelt, shows the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. _Subjectivity_, the introduction of the personal note, the expression\r\nby the author of his own individual feelings and ideas. The Classicist,\r\naiming at universality and completeness, considered only the typical and\r\neternal as suitable material for literature and carefully excluded\r\nwhatever seemed peculiar to himself; his ideal was to give perfect\r\nliterary form to ideas and sentiments acceptable to mankind generally,\r\ntruths of universal application. Originality of idea or sentiment was\r\nnot of prime importance with him; his aim was rather to give finished\r\nform to \"what oft was said, but ne'er so well expressed.\" The aim of the\r\nRomanticist, on the other hand, was to turn to literary uses his own\r\nindividual experiences, to give forceful and effective, rather than\r\nelegant, expression to his own peculiar feelings and ideas. This\r\nsubjectivity led naturally to many abuses; it also led to the production\r\nof some of the masterpieces of literature. Lyric poetry, that had almost\r\ndied of inanition during the period of Classicism, took on new and\r\nvigorous life and became again one of the most important literary\r\ngenres. The mere mention of such famous poets as Byron, Shelley, Heine,\r\nMusset, Leopardi, Espronceda, indicates the extent and importance of\r\nlyric poetry in the first half of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n2. _Emotional appeal_. Classicism made its appeal to the intellect;\r\nRomanticism to the emotions. The aim of the Classicist being to give\r\nperfect literary expression to the accumulated wisdom of mankind or to\r\nreform social, moral, or political conditions by means of ridicule, he\r\naccepted logic as his guide. The Romanticist, whose aim it was to\r\nexpress his individual sentiments and ideas, rebelled against the\r\nrestraints of logic and common sense; his purpose was not to persuade\r\nhis reader or hearer by logical reasoning, but rather to carry him off\r\nhis feet by the onrush of his passions and sentiments. The Classicist\r\nmistrusted the imagination for fear that it might lead him away from\r\ncommon sense and moderation; the Romanticist turned to it eagerly as the\r\nmost effective means of conveying to reader or hearer his ardent\r\nsentiments and vague aspirations. For the reason then that the\r\nClassicist made his appeal to the intellect, mistrusted the imagination,\r\nand usually avoided all strong passions except that of indignation,\r\nClassicism tended to become more and more prosaic. Romanticism, because\r\nof its appeal to the emotions and to the imagination, put new life and\r\npower into literature, and immeasurably widened its range. On the other\r\nhand the tendency on the part of writers of little ability and less\r\njudgment to go to absurd extremes in their efforts to express strange\r\nand original ideas and sentiments, to get as far away as possible from\r\nthe logical and commonplace, led to the production of much absurd\r\nwriting. This and the attempt of many of them to apply the extreme\r\nprinciples of Romanticism to daily life as well as to literature\r\nresulted in the derogatory sense that the word _romantic_ came to have\r\nin its ordinary acceptation. The results of Romanticism in its\r\nexaggerated form may be seen in the satirical article written in 1837 by\r\nMesonero Romanos, _El Romanticismo y los Románticos_. This article,\r\nhighly recommended in this connection, may easily be found in his\r\ncollected writings _Obras_, Madrid, 1881, or, better still, it may be\r\nstudied in the excellent edition of Professor G.T. Northup, _Selections\r\nfrom Mesonero Romanos_.\r\n\r\n3. _Spiritual awakening_. The latter half of the eighteenth century was\r\na materialistic age. The realities of life were limited to such as could\r\nbe understood by the five senses and the reasoning faculty. Life and\r\nliterature for the Classicist meant reasoned submission to things as\r\nthey were; achievement was the accepted basis of judgment for his life\r\nor literature. The Romanticist rebelled against this materialistic view\r\nof life; for him the real truths lay beyond the apparent realities; he\r\ngrasped at the impalpable and infinite, and wished to have his life and\r\nliterature judged by his aspirations, rather than by his achievements.\r\nHence, too, the vague longings, the gentle melancholy or violent revolt,\r\nthe spiritual uplift. The new sense of the wonder and glory of the\r\nuniverse, as well as the spiritual reality behind the material, has\r\nsuggested as a definition of Romanticism the \"Renascence of Wonder.\"\r\n\r\n4. _Revival of the Middle Ages and national traditions_. The\r\nRomanticists were inclined to turn away from the prosaic present and to\r\nseek material for their writings in the Middle Ages, the time of\r\nunrestrained feelings and emotions, of chivalrous adventure and romance,\r\nof strong religious faith, of miracles and superstition. The historical\r\nnovel, in which the powerful imagination of a Walter Scott made the past\r\nlive again, became popular throughout Europe; innumerable dramas sought\r\ntheir plots in medieval history and legend. Spain, with her rich\r\nliterature of popular ballads and drama, a storehouse of picturesque\r\nlegends and traditions, attracted the attention of Romanticists\r\neverywhere, so that for Spaniards the movement came to have a patriotic\r\nsignificance. The best Romanticists did not limit themselves to the\r\nMiddle Ages; they broadened their vision to include the whole past of\r\nthe human race, whereas the Classicists, fixing their eyes steadily upon\r\nancient Greece and Rome, whenever they were inclined to turn away from\r\nthe present, ignored entirely the medieval period and the early modern.\r\n\r\n5. _Picturesqueness_. Seeking to give polished expression to the\r\nprobable and typical, the Classicist abhorred exaggeration and violent\r\ncontrasts. The Romanticist, on the other hand, was attracted to the\r\ngrotesque, mingled the ugly and the beautiful, the commonplace and the\r\nfantastic; he delighted in striking antitheses.\r\n\r\n6. _Love of inanimate nature_. The Classicist, instead of going directly\r\nto Nature for individual inspiration, was content to repeat in new ways\r\nthe generally accepted ideas regarding natural scenery. His interest lay\r\nalmost wholly in mankind, so that inanimate Nature usually served as a\r\nmerely conventional background. The Romanticist loved Nature for its own\r\nsake, and many masterpieces of lyric poetry were due to its inspiration.\r\nHe loved Nature in all her aspects and moods; if these were grandiose or\r\nviolent, the greater was his admiration.\r\n\r\n7. _Freedom from rule and conventionality in literary forms and\r\ntechnique._ The foregoing characteristics, concerned mainly with the\r\ncontent of Romantic literature, would naturally mean a corresponding\r\nrevolution in literary form and technique. Rules and conventions had\r\nkept accumulating about literature, until by the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, when French Classicism dominated literary Europe,\r\nthey were so rigid that only a few of the many men of letters were able\r\nto produce literature that was not wholly artificial and uninspired.\r\nEach kind of literature was supposed to be written in a certain way;\r\nnarrative poetry had a certain prescribed meter; lyric poetry another;\r\ntragedy and comedy should be carefully kept apart. The Romanticist\r\nproceeded at once to throw overboard all these rules and\r\nconventionalities. Each literary production was to be judged upon its\r\nown merits as literature, not upon the closeness of its adherence to any\r\nset of rules, and each author was to be at liberty to get his results in\r\nany way that he might choose. Hence we find the mingling of literary\r\ngenres, the neglect of the dramatic unities, the invention of new meters\r\nand the revival of old ones.\r\n\r\n8. _Richness of language_. Because of the continual elimination of words\r\nconsidered unsuitable for literary expression, the language of the\r\nClassicists was becoming more and more impoverished, diction was\r\nbecoming more and more stereotyped and artificial. The Romanticists,\r\nwith their revolutionary ideas as to content, rebelled against any rule\r\nor convention that would restrict their choice of words or diction;\r\nseeking complete and effective self-expression, they turned to literary\r\nuse all the resources of the language of their own time and of any other\r\nage as well. The result was a great enrichment of language through the\r\neffective use of highly colored, picturesque words and diction, as fresh\r\nand bright as newly coined pieces of gold.\r\n\r\nSuch are the general characteristics of the movement that had such a\r\nprofound effect upon the literatures of western Europe in the closing\r\nyears of the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth.\r\nAll of them may be observed in the literature produced in Spain during\r\nthe twenty years from 1830 to 1850, although, naturally, they do not all\r\nhave the same importance there as in other countries. In a general way\r\nit may be said that the movement was not so revolutionary as in France,\r\nfor example, where Classicism had taken deeper root. Moreover, in Spain,\r\nRomanticism meant the revival of some of the literary ideals of the\r\n_Siglo de Oro_, and to this extent at least could hardly be considered\r\nrevolutionary. The most complete representative of Romanticism in\r\nSpanish dramatic literature is the _Don Álvaro_ of Angel de Saavedra,\r\nbetter known as the Duque de Rivas; in this play are to be found all the\r\nabove-mentioned characteristics, even those that have to do more\r\nnaturally with lyric poetry, subjectivity and love of nature. Not only\r\ndoes it present Romanticism in its most effective form; it also shows\r\nthe pitfalls of exaggeration and improbability that even the greatest\r\nRomanticists failed to avoid when the check of common sense was removed\r\nand free rein was given to the imagination. But since we are here\r\nconcerned mainly with _Los Amantes de Teruel_, a play that demands for\r\nits understanding and appreciation much less familiarity with the\r\nSpanish language than that required by _Don Álvaro_, the extent to which\r\nthe masterpiece of Hartzenbusch is representative of Romanticism will\r\nnow be briefly noted.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: In order that the student may discover for himself the\r\nessential differences between the two schools of drama, it is\r\nrecommended that he read a classical play such as Moratin's _El Sí de\r\nlas Niñas_ before reading _Los Amantes de Teruel_. In comparing the two\r\nplays he should bear in mind that, for the reason that they are both\r\nartistic masterpieces, they avoid the extremes of Classicism and\r\nRomanticism, and that they do not illustrate entirely the opposite\r\ncharacteristics of the less artistic examples of the two kinds of\r\ndrama.]\r\n\r\n#VII. Romanticism in _Los Amantes de Teruel._# That the appeal is\r\nmainly to the emotions and imagination is quite evident. The plot is\r\nbased on a legend that owes its chief interest to the unusual and even\r\nimprobable ending; and the exceptional and improbable, if they are to be\r\neffectively treated in literature, must appeal to the imagination, must\r\nso stir the sentiments of the reader or hearer that the reasoning\r\nfaculty may be kept from becoming too active. Not only is the\r\n_dénouement_ itself improbable; the somewhat melodramatic figure of\r\nZulima and the important part she plays in keeping apart the lovers\r\nuntil it is too late, would hardly be convincing if the main appeal of\r\nthe play were to the intellect. These improbabilities are willingly\r\nignored by the reader or spectator as he allows himself to be carried\r\nalong in the current of passion to the final scene of deep emotion and\r\nintense pathos. Melodious verse and poetic imagery help to make\r\neffective this emotional appeal.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual appeal of the play is apparent. To Marsilla and Isabel\r\nlove is so spiritualized that materialism can find in it no place. Their\r\nlove for each other is the \"encarnación del cariño anticipado al nacer,\"\r\nlife means for them \"seguir con el cuerpo amando, como el espíritu amó.\"\r\nLove is life itself; and when no longer permitted to love each other in\r\nthis life for the reason that Isabel, believing her lover to be dead and\r\nwishing to sacrifice herself in order that her mother's good name may be\r\npreserved, has become the wife of Rodrigo de Azagra, they willingly\r\nreturn to the spiritual world from which together _they had come into\r\nthe world of materiality_.\r\n\r\nThe dramatization of a medieval legend is typical of the newly awakened\r\ninterest in the Middle Ages. Five years before the beginning of the\r\nsupposed action of the play, shortly after Marsilla had left home to\r\ngain name and fortune in the wars against the infidels, was fought at\r\nNavas de Tolosa one of the most decisive battles between Christianity\r\nand Mohammedanism. The year after his departure from Teruel there\r\nascended the throne of Aragón the boy that was to be known to history as\r\n_Jaime el Conquistador_ because of his reconquest of southeastern Spain\r\nfor Christianity. In the lull that preceded the approaching storm the\r\nChristians and Moslems in the eastern part of the peninsula were at\r\npeace, so that in the play they mingle freely, treating each other with\r\nthe chivalrous respect that was characteristic of the Middle Ages. The\r\nnumerous references to contemporary historic personages and events and\r\nthe careful attention to local color bring vividly before us the life of\r\nthat part of Aragón recently recovered from the Moors. The _dénouement_\r\nis made less improbable by placing the action of the play in that age of\r\ndeep convictions, exalted idealism, chivalrous customs, and in that part\r\nof Spain where tenacity of purpose has always been regarded as a\r\ncharacteristic trait.\r\n\r\nPicturesqueness, in its literary sense is not very apparent in the play\r\nas we now have it. In the first version there were examples of striking\r\ncontrasts, a mingling of the tragic and comic, the noble and base, but\r\nthese were toned down or eliminated by the author in his revisions of\r\nthe play. For an example of exaggerated picturesqueness, with its\r\nviolent contrasts, mingling of the sublime and vulgar, the grotesque and\r\nbeautiful, the student is referred to _Don Álvaro_.\r\n\r\nThe classical conventionality that each kind of literature should have\r\nits prescribed form and that the various literary genres should be kept\r\napart was disregarded by Hartzenbusch. In this play we see a mingling of\r\nscenes in prose with those in verse, we find the versification varied\r\naccording to the nature of the scenes, a mingling of dramatic dialogue\r\nand lyrical expression of sentiment and passion. The action of the play\r\nin its first form was impeded by the excessive lyricism of some of the\r\nscenes; although notably reduced, this lyric element is still quite\r\napparent in the scene between Marsilla and Zulima in the first act, for\r\nexample; or between Marsilla and Isabel in the last. In the first\r\nversion Mari-Gómez, later changed to Teresa with the suppression of most\r\nof her garrulity, was made to serve as a _graciosa_ and thus relieve the\r\ntenseness of the serious scenes.\r\n\r\nAs to the three dramatic unities so dear to the Classicists, those of\r\ntime and place are disregarded. The action shifts from Valencia to\r\nTeruel; the time occupied covers the last six days of the _plazo_ given\r\nMarsilla in which to gain name and fortune and return home to claim\r\nIsabel for wife. The unity of action, the one essential unity in any\r\nwork of art, is carefully preserved. In the first version could be seen\r\nsomething of the Romantic tendency to complicate the plot by the\r\nintroduction of an excessive number of characters and needless episodes,\r\nbut in its final form the plot is simple and nothing is permitted to\r\ninterfere with its dramatic development.\r\n\r\nIn the first version there was also some tendency to abuse the new\r\nfreedom from conventionality in language, a tendency to seek out unusual\r\nwords and phrases for the sake of their picturesqueness, rather than for\r\ntheir artistic appropriateness. In the polishing and toning-down\r\nprocess, such words and phrases were eliminated, so that the play in its\r\nfinal form serves as a good illustration of the permanent enrichment of\r\nthe literary language by the Romanticists. Likewise, in its\r\nversification, it offers a good example of the metrical variety found in\r\nthe Spanish dramatists of the Golden Age and revived by the\r\nRomanticists.\r\n\r\n#VIII. Versification.# Only the fundamental principles of Spanish\r\nversification will be noted here. For a more adequate treatment the\r\nstudent is referred to such works as Andrés Bello's _Ortología y\r\nmétrica_ (Vol. IV of _Obras completas_, Madrid, 1890), or the _Prosodia\r\ncastellana y versificación_ of E. Benot; or to the more easily\r\naccessible notes on Spanish versification in Hills and Morley's _Modern\r\nSpanish Lyrics_ or Ford's _Spanish Anthology_.\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of two of the essential differences between Spanish and\r\nEnglish versification is needed for the appreciation of the poetry of\r\nthis play. Whereas in English poetry the number of feet to the line is\r\nessential, in Spanish the basis of meter is the number of syllables;\r\nmoreover, in syllable-counting there are certain rules (too complicated\r\nto be given here) regarding the treatment of contiguous vowels as one\r\nsyllable or more than one. Another difference that should be noted is\r\nthat in Spanish poetry there are two kinds of rime, consonantal rime and\r\nassonance. Consonantal rime is the same as that used in English poetry,\r\nidentity of the last stressed vowel sound as well as all following vowel\r\nor consonant sounds in two or more verses; as for example, in lines\r\n127-130, Act I, _clemencia, Valencia: favor, mejor_. Assonance is\r\nidentity in a series of verses of the last stressed vowel and of a\r\nfollowing unstressed vowel, if there be one, but not of a consonant; in\r\nother words, assonance is the correspondence of the vowels, but not of\r\nthe consonants, in the riming syllables. Thus, in the first 110 lines of\r\nthe play, all the even verses have the same vowel in the last stressed\r\nsyllables: _volver, administré, fiel, pie, Adel, partiré, el, rey_, etc.\r\nOnly the strong vowel in a diphthong is recognized, so that in these 110\r\nlines the assonance of the alternate verses is in _e_. In the first 148\r\nlines of Act IV all the even verses have one and the same vowel in the\r\nlast accented syllable and one and the same vowel in the unaccented\r\nsyllable: _pueblo, bandoleros, prenderlos, tiempo, vinieron, provecho_,\r\netc. The assonance is, therefore, _é-o_.\r\n\r\nOf the many verse-forms, _i.e._, definite combinations of line and rime,\r\nto be found in Spanish poetry, we find the following in this play:\r\n_romance, romance heroico, redondilla, quintilla, décima, copla de arte\r\nmayor_, and _silva_.\r\n\r\nThe _romance_, or ballad meter, is the most thoroughly national of all\r\nSpanish meters and has always been very popular with the dramatists. It\r\nhas, regularly, eight syllables to the line, with a regular rhythmic\r\naccent on the seventh, and has assonance in the alternate lines. The\r\nseventh syllable may or may not be followed by one or two unstressed\r\nsyllables, but the line is called octosyllabic; one unstressed syllable\r\nis counted whether it be present or not. The first 110 lines of Act I,\r\nfor example, are in _romance_. Note that the regular rhythmic stress of\r\neach line is on the seventh syllable; that the odd lines have seven or\r\neight syllables; that all the even lines have seven metrical syllables\r\neach, and have assonance in _e_. In the first 148 lines of Act IV, all\r\nof the even lines have eight syllables each, for the reason that each\r\nseventh syllable is followed by an unaccented syllable, the assonance\r\nbeing _é-o._ This is the normal _romance_ line, eight-syllabled and in\r\nassonance.\r\n\r\nThe _romance heroico_ or _real_ differs from the ordinary _romance_ in\r\nthat the lines are hendecasyllabic (eleven-syllabled). Lines 269-474,\r\nAct IV, are in _romance heroico_, with assonance in _á-a_.\r\n\r\nThe _redondilla_ consists of four octosyllabic lines, with consonantal\r\nrime, usually arranged thus: _abba_. In Act I, for example, lines\r\n111-458 consist of 87 _redondillas_.\r\n\r\nThe _quintilla_ consists of five octosyllabic lines, with two\r\nconsonantal rimes, arranged so that no more than two may come together:\r\n_ababa, abbab, abaab_, etc. In Act III lines 62-226 consist of 33\r\n_quintillas_. The last one has a very unusual combination of rimes:\r\n_abbba_.\r\n\r\nThe _décima_ consists of ten octosyllabic lines, with four consonantal\r\nrimes usually arranged as in lines 761-770, or 771-780, Act II:\r\n_abbaaccddc_. The _décima_ is not properly considered as two\r\n_quintillas_, since there should be a pause at the end of the fourth\r\nline of a _décima_.\r\n\r\nThe _copla_ (stanza) _de arte mayor_ contains eight lines with three\r\nconsonantal rimes arranged thus: _abbaacca_. Each line is divided into\r\ntwo hemistitches, with rhythmic stress on the fifth syllable of each\r\nhemistich. The sixth syllable of either hemistich or of both may be\r\nlacking, so that there may be a total of 10, 11, or 12 syllables in a\r\nline. Lines 179-282, Act II, are made up of thirteen _coplas de arte\r\nmayor_. Most of the lines have 11 or 12 syllables; note that verses 187,\r\n200, 215, etc., have only ten each.\r\n\r\nThe _silva_ is usually composed of eleven-syllabled lines, intermingled\r\nwith lines of seven syllables. There is consonantal rime, but without\r\nregularity; and many lines are left unrimed. An example of the _silva_\r\nmay be found in lines 309-437, Act III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        SCHEME OF VERSIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\n    Act  I.    1-110 Romance (_e_)\r\n             111-458 Redondillas\r\n    Act II.    1-178 Romance (_a_)\r\n             179-282 Coplas de arte mayor\r\n             283-466 Redondillas\r\n             467-573 Prose\r\n             574-760 Romance _(é-a)_\r\n             761-780 Décimas\r\n    Act III.    1-61 Prose\r\n              62-226 Quintillas\r\n             227-308 Prose\r\n             309-437 Silva\r\n    Act IV.    1-148 Romance _(é-o)_\r\n             149-268 Redondillas\r\n             269-474 Romance heroico _(á-a)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\nThe most important books and articles that treat of Hartzenbusch and the\r\nlegend of the _Amantes de Teruel_ have already been mentioned. In them\r\nmay be found many references and extensive bibliographical data. The\r\nbest of the writings of Hartzenbusch are contained in the five volumes\r\npublished in the well-known series _Colección de Escritores\r\nCastellanos_.

Mucho me aflige, Isabel,\r\n           tu pesadumbre tenaz;\r\n           pero, por desgracia, yo                                55\r\n           no la puedo remediar.\r\n           Esclavo de su palabra\r\n           es el varón principal;\r\n           tengo empeñada la mía:\r\n           la debo desempeñar.                                    60\r\n           En el honor de tu padre\r\n           no se vió mancha jamás:\r\n           juventud honrada pide\r\n           más honrada ancianidad.\r\n\r\nISABEL.    No pretendo yo....\r\n\r\nPEDRO.                       Por otra                             65\r\n           parte, parece que están\r\n           de Dios ciertas cosas.

En Teruel vivió\r\n           (no sé si te acordarás)\r\n           un tal Roger de Lizana,\r\n           caballero catalán.                                     75\r\n\r\nISABEL.    ¿El templario?\r\n\r\nPEDRO.                   Sí. Roger\r\n           paraba en Monzón. Allá\r\n           es voz que penas y culpas\r\n           de su libre mocedad\r\n           trajéronle una dolencia\r\n           de espíritu y corporal,                                80\r\n           que vino a dejarle casi\r\n           mudo, imbécil, incapaz.\r\n           Pacífico en su idiotez,\r\n           permitíanle vagar\r\n           libre por el pueblo. Un día,                           85\r\n           sobre una dificultad\r\n           en mi encargo y sobre cómo\r\n           se debiera de allanar,\r\n           don Rodrigo y yo soltamos\r\n           palabras de enemistad.                                 90\r\n           Marchóse enojado, y yo\r\n           exclamé al verle marchar:\r\n           «¿Ha de ser este hombre dueño\r\n           de lo que yo quiero más?\r\n           Si la muerte puede sola                                95\r\n           mi palabra desatar,\r\n           lléveme el Señor, y quede\r\n           Isabel en libertad.»\r\n\r\nISABEL.    ¡Oh padre!\r\n\r\nPEDRO.

Roger. Llégase a mí,\r\n           y en voz pronunciada mal,\r\n           «Uno (dijo) de los dos                                 105\r\n           la vida aquí dejará.»\r\n\r\nISABEL.    Y ¿qué hicisteis?\r\n\r\nPEDRO.                      Yo, pensando\r\n           que bien pudiera quizás\r\n           mi muerte impedir alguna\r\n           mayor infelicidad,                                     110\r\n           crucé los brazos, y quieto\r\n           esperé el golpe mortal.\r\n\r\nISABEL.    ¡Cielos! ¿Y Roger?\r\n\r\nPEDRO.

En fin, de estarse\r\n          tanto sin pestañear,\r\n          él, cuyos sentidos eran\r\n          la suma debilidad,\r\n          se trastornó, cayó; dió                                 135\r\n          la guarnición del puñal\r\n          en tierra, le fué la punta\r\n          al corazón a parar\r\n          al infeliz, y a mis plantas\r\n          rindió el aliento vital.                                140\r\n          Huí con espanto: Azagra,\r\n          viniéndose a disculpar\r\n          conmigo, me halló; le dije\r\n          que no pisaba el umbral\r\n          de aquella casa en mi vida;                             145\r\n          y él, próvido y eficaz,\r\n          avisó al rey, y mandó\r\n          el cadáver sepultar.--\r\n          Ya ves, hija: por no ir\r\n          yo contra tu voluntad,                                  150\r\n          por no cumplir mi palabra,\r\n          quise dejarme matar;\r\n          y Dios me guardó la vida:\r\n          su decreto celestial\r\n          es sin duda que esa boda                                155\r\n          se haga por fin ... --y se hará,\r\n          si en tres días no parece\r\n          tu preferido galán.\r\n\r\nISABEL (_aparte_). ¡Ay de él y de mí!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           ESCENA III\r\n\r\n\r\nTERESA.--DON PEDRO, ISABEL\r\n\r\nTERESA.

Señora ... al fin nos vemos.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. Honrad mi estrado, ya que la prisa de\r\nvenir a mi casa no os ha dejado sosegar en la vuestra.\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Aquí vengo a buscar el sosiego que necesito.             480\r\n(_Siéntase_.) ¿Qué me decís de mi desdeñosa?\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. ¿Me permitiréis que hable con toda franqueza?\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Con franqueza pregunto yo.--Hablad.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. Mi esposo os prometió la mano de su                    485\r\nhija única; y, por él, debéis contar de seguro con ella.\r\nPero la delicadeza de vuestro amor y la elevación de\r\nvuestro carácter ¿se satisfarían con la posesión de una\r\nmujer, cuyo cariño no fuese vuestro?\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. El corazón de Isabel no es ahora mío, lo                 490\r\nsé; pero Isabel es virtuosa, es el espejo de las doncellas:\r\ncumplirá lo que jure, apreciará mi rendida fe, y será el\r\nejemplo de las casadas.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. Mirad que su afecto a Marsilla no se ha\r\ndisminuído.                                                       495\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. No me inspira celos un rival, cuyo paradero\r\nse ignora, cuya muerte, para mí, es indudable.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. ¿Y si volviese aún? ¿Y si antes de\r\ncumplirse el término, se presentara tan enamorado como\r\nse fué, y con aumentos muy considerables de hacienda?             500\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Mal haría en aparecer ni antes ni después de\r\nmis bodas. Él prometió renunciar a Isabel, si no se\r\nenriquecía en seis años; pero yo nada he prometido. Si\r\nvuelve, uno de los dos ha de quedar solo junto a Isabel.\r\nLa mano que pretendemos ambos, no se compra con oro;              505\r\nse gana con hierro, se paga con sangre.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. Vuestro lenguaje no es muy reverente\r\npara usado en esta casa, y conmigo; pero os le perdono,\r\nporque me perdonéis la pesadumbre que voy a daros.\r\nYo, noble don Rodrigo, yo que hasta hoy consentí en               510\r\nvuestro enlace con Isabel, he visto por último que de él\r\niba a resultar su desgracia y la vuestra. Tengo, pues, que\r\ndeciros, como cristiana y madre; tengo que suplicaros por\r\nnuestro Señor y nuestra Señora, que desistáis de un empeño,\r\nya poco distante de la temeridad.                                 515\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Ese empeño es público, hace muchos años\r\nque dura, y se ha convertido para mí en caso de honor.\r\nEs imposible que yo desista. No os opongáis a lo que\r\nno podréis impedir.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. Aunque habéis desairado mi ruego, tal                  520\r\nvez no le desaire mi esposo.\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Mucho alcanzáis con él: adora en vos, y lo\r\nmerecéis, porque ha quince años que os empleáis en la\r\ncaridad y la penitencia... Pero ... ¿os ha contado\r\nya la muerte de Roger de Lizana?                                  525\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. ¡Cómo! ¿Roger ha muerto?\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Sí, loco y mudo, según estaba; desgraciadamente,\r\nsegún merecía; y a los pies de don Pedro, como\r\nera justo.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. ¡Cielos! Nada sabía de ese infeliz.                    530\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Ese infeliz era muy delincuente, era el\r\ncorruptor de una dama ilustre.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. ¡Don Rodrigo!\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. La esposa más respetable entre las de\r\nTeruel.                                                           535\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. Por compasión.... Si Roger ha\r\nmuerto....\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Casi espiró en mis brazos. Yo tendí sobre\r\nel féretro su cadáver, yo hallé sobre su corazón unas\r\ncartas....                                                        540\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. ¡Cartas!\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. De mujer ... cinco ... sin firma todas.\r\nPero yo os las presentaré, y vos me diréis quién las ha\r\nescrito.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. ¡Callad! ¡callad!                                      545\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Si no, acudiré a vuestro esposo: bien\r\nconoce la letra.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. ¡No! ¡Dádmelas, rompedlas, quemadlas!\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Se os entregarán; pero Isabel me ha de\r\nentregar a mí su mano primero.                                    550\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. ¡Oh!\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Dios os guarde, señora.\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. Deteneos, oídme.\r\n\r\nRODRIGO. Para que os oiga, venid a verlas. (_Vase_.)\r\n\r\nMARGARITA. Escuchad, escuchadme.

Si echáis menos a mi señora, ya os he dicho\r\nque no está en casa, porque para ella, la caridad es antes\r\nque todo. El juez de este año, Domingo Celladas, tenía            15\r\nun hijo en tierra de infieles: Jaime, ya le conocéis. Hoy,\r\nsin que hubiese noticia de que viniera, se le han encontrado\r\nen el camino de Valencia unos mercaderes, herido y\r\nsin conocimiento. Por un rastro de sangre que iba a parar\r\na un hoyo, se ha comprendido que debieron echarle                 20\r\ndentro; y se cree que hasta poder salir, habrá estado en\r\nel hoyo quizá más de un día, porque las heridas no son\r\nrecientes. Vuestra madre ha sido llamada para asistirle;\r\nme ha encargado que os aderece; os he puesto hecha una\r\nimagen; y ni siquiera he logrado que deis una mirada al           25\r\nvestido, para ver si os gusta.\r\n\r\nISABEL.

Sí, a esa hora, a esa hora misma partió ...\r\npara nunca volver. En este aposento, allí, delante de ese\r\nbalcón estaba yo, llorando sobre mi labor, como ahora             40\r\nsobre mis galas. Continuamente miraba a la calle por\r\ndonde había de pasar, para verle; ahora no miro: no\r\nle veré. Por allí vino, dirigiendo el fogoso alazán, enseñado\r\na parase bajo mis balcones. Por allí vino, vestida\r\nla cota, la lanza en la mano, al brazo la banda, último don       45\r\nde mi cariño. «Hasta la dicha o hasta la tumba,» me dijo.\r\n«Tuya o muerta,» le dije yo; y caí sin aliento en el balcón\r\nmismo, tendidas las manos hacia la mitad de mi alma que\r\nse ausentaba.--¡Suya o muerta! Y voy a dar la mano a\r\nRodrigo. ¡Bien cumplo mi palabra!                                 50\r\n\r\nTERESA. Hija mía, desechad esas ideas. Yo ¿qué\r\nos he de decir para consolaros? Que os he visto nacer,\r\nque habéis jugado en mis brazos y en mis rodillas ... y\r\nque diera yo porque recobraseis la paz del alma y fuerais\r\nfeliz ¡ay!, diera yo todos los días que me faltan que vivir,      55\r\nmenos uno para verlo.\r\n\r\nISABEL. ¿Feliz, Teresa? Con este vestido, ¿cómo\r\nhe de ser feliz? ¡Pesa tanto, me ahoga tanto!...\r\nQuítamele, Teresa. (_Levantándose_.)\r\n\r\nTERESA. Señora, que viene don Rodrigo.                            60\r\n\r\nISABEL. ¡Don Rodrigo!

Tanto mis\r\ndeudos como los de Azagra me instan a que apresure la\r\nceremonia; pero aun no ha fenecido el plazo que otorgué           230\r\na don Diego. Al toque de vísperas de un domingo, salió\r\nde su patria el malogrado joven, seis años y siete días\r\nhace: hasta que suene aquella señal en mi oído, no tengo\r\nlibertad para disponer de mi hija. (_A don Martín._)\r\nPorque veáis de qué modo cumplo mi promesa, os he rogado          235\r\nque vinierais aquí.\r\n\r\nMARTÍN. ¡Inútil escrupulosidad!

Isabel deseará la compañía de su madre:\r\npudiéramos pasar por casa del Juez....\r\n\r\nTERESA. Ahora empezaba el herido a volver en su\r\nconocimiento. Si antes de vísperas no se halla mi señora          245\r\nen la iglesia, es señal de que no puede asistir a los desposorios:\r\nesto me ha dicho.\r\n\r\nPEDRO. La esperaremos en el templo. (_A don Martín._)\r\nSi la pesadumbre os permite acompañarnos, venid....\r\n\r\nMARTÍN. Excusadme el presenciar un acto que debe                  250\r\nserme tan doloroso.\r\n\r\nPEDRO.

Con pena, con celos veo yo a Isabel dirigirse\r\nal altar. Hubo un tiempo en que la tuve por hija: hoy\r\nme quitan su filial cariño, y ella consiente. Pero ¿qué           260\r\nfalta hace al mísero cadáver de mi hijo la constancia de la\r\nque él amó?

Apenas se detuvo en Teruel: yo no pude\r\nverle.\r\n\r\nADEL. ¿Qué ha pasado con Jaime Celladas?\r\n\r\nMARTÍN. Le han herido gravemente al llegar a la villa:            275\r\nen su lecho yace todavía sin voz ni conocimiento.\r\n\r\nADEL. Luego ¿tú nada sabes?\r\n\r\nMARTÍN. ¿Qué vas a decirme?\r\n\r\nADEL. Acabo de averiguar que, disfrazada con traje\r\nde hombre, ha entrado en Teruel Zulima, la esposa del             280\r\nAmir de Valencia.\r\n\r\nMARTÍN. ¿La que fué causa de la pérdida de mi hijo?\r\n\r\nADEL.

Tu hijo libró de un asesinato pérfido al Amir\r\nde Valencia, y el Amir le ha colmado de riquezas y honores.\r\nHerido en un combate, no se le permitió caminar hasta reponerse.\r\nJaime venía delante para anunciar su vuelta.                      290\r\nSígueme, y no pararé hasta poner a Marsilla en tus brazos.\r\n(_Vase_.)\r\n\r\nMARTÍN (_alzando las manos al cielo, arrebatado de\r\njúbilo_). ¡Señor! ¡Señor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCENA VI\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARITA.--DON MARTÍN\r\n\r\nMARGARITA (_dentro_). ¡Isabel! ¡Isabel!

In the first edition of the play Marsilla begins the account\r\nof his adventures thus:\r\n\r\n          Mi nombre es Diego Marsilla,\r\n          y cuna Teruel me dió,\r\n          ciudad que ayer se fundó\r\n          del Turia en la fresca orilla.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of accuracy of detail the author changed this to the\r\nreading of the present text. The river flowing past Teruel changes its\r\nname from Guadalaviar to Turia only after it has left Teruel behind.\r\nMoreover, Teruel was, strictly speaking, _villa_ at the time of the\r\nsupposed action of the play, and not _ciudad_: the title _ciudad_ was\r\nnot granted to it by the King of Aragon until the year 1347.\r\n\r\n193. #Ayer se fundó.# Destroyed by the Moors, Teruel was rebuilt in\r\n1171, forty-six years earlier. In the life of a city, a generation seems\r\nbut a day.\r\n\r\n195-197. #cuyos muros ... pobladores = cuyos muros, levantados entre\r\nhorrores de lid atroz, fueron amasados con la sangre de sus fuertes\r\npobladores.#\r\n\r\n199-226. In these lines the idea of \"predestined love\" is exemplified.\r\n\r\n204. #sus#, _their_ (#del hombre y de la mujer#).\r\n\r\n213-214. #antes ... vernos = antes de vernos, nos amábamos.#\r\n\r\n219-222. A similar idea was expressed in the corresponding four lines of\r\nthe first edition thus:\r\n\r\n          Y parecía un querer\r\n          tan firme en alma de niño,\r\n          recuerdo de otro cariño\r\n          tenido antes de nacer.\r\n\r\n223-226. These four lines may be translated thus: _the love that united\r\nIsabel and me_ (#nuestro querer#) _when we came into this sad world\r\nwas merely the continuance_ (#seguir#) _in the physical world of the\r\nlove that already existed in the spiritual_. Compare idea expressed by\r\n\"marriages are made in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n246. #aun vivo#; if the time were up, either I should have succeeded\r\nor should now be dead.\r\n\r\n254. #Navas de Tolosa#, village in the Province of Jaén, in the south\r\nof Spain, famous in history because of the decisive victory gained\r\nthere, July 16, 1212, by the allied kings of Christian Spain over the\r\nMoslems. In the first edition, at the mention of this disastrous defeat\r\nof the Moors, Zulima interrupts Marsilla's narrative with an outburst of\r\nfeeling quite appropriate in a Mohammedan:\r\n\r\n          ¡Lugar maldito del cielo,\r\n          donde la negra fortuna\r\n          postró de la media luna\r\n          la pujanza por el suelo!\r\n\r\n258 et seq. In the early years of the 13th century a religious sect in\r\nthe south of France, the Albigenses, rebelled against the authority of\r\nthe Church of Rome. Pope Innocent III proclaimed a crusade against them\r\nin 1208, and a bloody war began in which the crusaders were led by the\r\nruthless Simon de Montfort until his death at the siege of Toulouse\r\n(1218). During this Albigensian War (1208-1229) Beziers and other\r\nimportant cities in the south of France were almost destroyed.\r\n\r\n267-270. #Y en pena ... sepultó = y en pena de que mi mano rompió el\r\nhierro de mis cadenas, profundo encierro me sepultó en vida.#\r\n\r\n281. #haz por escuchar atento#, _try to listen attentively to_ ...\r\n\r\n293. #aquí#, in the land of the Moors.\r\n\r\n303. #Respuesta ... dé = es bien que se le dé a ella respuesta.#\r\n\r\n311-312. #Medita ... reclama#, _consider it well and you will grant\r\nto time what it demands as its due_.

José de Larra in his review of the play a few days after its\r\nfirst performance and only a few days before his own tragic death,\r\nspeaking for those who believe that death may be caused by grief alone,\r\nurged the author to pay no heed to critics who scoffed at the\r\n_dénouement_ of his play: \"Si óyese repetir a sus oídos un cargo vulgar\r\nque a los nuestros ha llegado, y que ni mentar hemos querido en este\r\nartículo; si óyese decir que el final de su obra es inverosímil, que el\r\namor no mata a nadie, puede responder que es un hecho consignado en la\r\nhistoria; que los cadáveres se conservan en Teruel, y la posibilidad en\r\nlos corazones sensibles; que las penas y las pasiones han llenado más\r\ncementerios que los médicos y los necios; que el amor mata (aunque no\r\nmate a lodo el mundo) como matan la ambición y la envidia; que más de\r\nuna mala nueva al ser recibida ha matado a personas robustas,\r\ninstantáneamente y como un rayo; y aun será en nuestro entender mejor\r\nque a ese cargo no responda, porque el que no lleve en su corazón la\r\nrespuesta, no comprenderá ninguna. Las teorías, las doctrinas, los\r\nsistemas se explican; los sentimientos se sienten.\" (_Colección de\r\nartículos_, page 197.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOCABULARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this vocabulary is to give English equivalents for the\r\nwords and locutions as used in this play, in order to help the student\r\nunderstand the text or translate it into clear, idiomatic English. In\r\nsome cases, therefore, the English equivalent is not a literal\r\ntranslation of the Spanish and may not give the usual meaning of the\r\nword or phrase. Moreover, words that the student is reasonably certain\r\nto know and those that have the same or almost the same form and meaning\r\nin Spanish and English are omitted, as well as inflected forms, except\r\nin the case of those that seem to offer special difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#A#\r\n\r\n#abandonar# leave, abandon\r\n\r\n#abatimiento# despondency, dejection\r\n\r\n#abierto# _p.p. of_ #abrir# open\r\n\r\n#abismo# abyss, gulf;
