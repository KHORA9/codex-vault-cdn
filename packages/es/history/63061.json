BOUVERIE AND CO., 11, HAYMARKET.\r\n\r\nTHE HAKLUYT SOCIETY, which is established for the purpose of printing\r\nrare or unpublished Voyages and Travels, aims at opening by this means\r\nan easier access to the sources of a branch of knowledge, which yields\r\nto none in importance, and is superior to most in agreeable variety.\r\nThe narratives of travellers and navigators make us acquainted with\r\nthe earth, its inhabitants and productions; they exhibit the growth of\r\nintercourse among mankind, with its effects on civilization, and, while\r\ninstructing, they at the same time awaken attention, by recounting the\r\ntoils and adventures of those who first explored unknown and distant\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of an Association of this kind, consists not merely in\r\nits system of literary co-operation, but also in its economy. The\r\nacquirements, taste, and discrimination of a number of individuals,\r\nwho feel an interest in the same pursuit, are thus brought to act in\r\nvoluntary combination, and the ordinary charges of publication are also\r\navoided, so that the volumes produced, are distributed among the Members\r\n(who can alone obtain them) at little more than the cost of printing and\r\npaper. The Society expends nearly the whole of its funds in printing\r\nworks for the Members; and since the cost of each copy varies inversely\r\nas the whole number of copies printed, it is obvious that the Members are\r\ngainers individually by the prosperity of the Society, and the consequent\r\nvigour of its operations.\r\n\r\nThe Members are requested to bear in mind that the power of the Council\r\nto make advantageous arrangements, will depend, in a great measure, on\r\nthe prompt payment of the subscriptions, which are payable in advance on\r\nthe 1st January, and are received by\r\n\r\n_The Secretary, WILLIAM DESBOROUGH COOLEY, 33, King-street, Bloomsbury;\r\nor at the LONDON LIBRARY, 12, St. James’s-square; and by T. RODD, 9,\r\nGreat Newport-street, Leicester-square, who is the Society’s Agent for\r\nthe delivery of its volumes._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready Published.\r\n\r\nThe Observations of Sir Richard Hawkins, KNT.\r\n\r\n    In his Voyage into the South Sea in 1593.

It cannot be denied that\r\nit tends to dispel much of the romance which has hitherto coloured so\r\nbrilliantly the history of the naval hero. But truth is thereby a gainer.\r\nRomance elevates the hero at the expense of human nature, and sacrifices\r\nthe many for the glory of one. It may not be without advantage to learn,\r\nfrom the example of one so justly celebrated as Drake, what sordid\r\nmotives may be cloaked under the pretence of national glory, and how\r\nmistrustfully we ought to listen to the professedly generous instigators\r\nof war and rapine.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish paper, Relacion de lo Sucedido, etc., (additional MSS. No.\r\n13,964, British Museum), which has the form of an official report, or\r\ndispatch, is extremely interesting, inasmuch as it allows us to see, in\r\nimmediate juxtaposition and direct contrast, the accounts of the affair\r\nat Puerto Rico, as given by the two belligerent parties.\r\n\r\nThese papers are here reproduced from the originals without change or\r\nemendation; so that their defects, whether attributable to negligence or\r\nignorance, may be taken into consideration in estimating their intrinsic\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nThe superficial inaccuracies of Maynarde’s paper are not a few; his\r\nconstant misspelling of proper names, as Corasaw for Curaçoa, St. Tomarta\r\nfor Sta. Martha, would seem to prove him illiterate. It is still more\r\nimportant, that, through oversight and omission, he states the number\r\nof the forces, who marched from Nombre de Dios to attack Panama, to be\r\nfifty, instead of seven hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to observe the variance between the Spanish and English\r\naccounts of the same action, both written in good faith. The Spaniards\r\nhad but seventy guns, and yet the English reckoned 5160 pieces of\r\nartillery playing on them. This tremendous fire would appear from the\r\nEnglish account to have done no great harm, while the Spaniards allege\r\nthat they killed four hundred of the enemy, besides wounding many more.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the place for a critical examination of the following\r\npages. The conflicting statements and opinions respecting the closing\r\nscene of Drake’s eventful life, are amply detailed in Mr. Barrow’s\r\njustly popular volume. Here it will be sufficient to observe that\r\nMaynarde’s keen and natural comments on his commanders, proceed from one\r\nwho, in regard to Drake, certainly writes in a friendly spirit, and from\r\nwhom the truth was wrung by the circumstances of his situation.\r\n\r\n                                                                 W. D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SIR FRANCIS DRAKE\r\n                               HIS VOYAGE,\r\n                                  1595:\r\n\r\n                                   BY\r\n                            THOMAS MAYNARDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR FRANCIS DRAKE HIS VOYAGE, 1595.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears by the attempts and knowen purposes of the Spaniarde, as by\r\nhis greedy desire to bee our neighboure in Bretaine, his fortifienge upon\r\nthe river of Brest, to gaine so near us a quiet and safe rode for his\r\nfleet, his carelessness in losinge the strongehouldes and townes which\r\nhe possessed in the Lowe Countries, not followinge those warres in that\r\nheate which he wonted, the rebellious rysinge of the Earle of Tyrone\r\n(wrought or drawen thereto undoubtedly by his wicked practises), that\r\nhee leaveth no means unattempted which he judged might bee a furtherance\r\nto turne our tranquillitie into accursed thraldom; so robbinge us of\r\nthat quiet peace which wee, from the hands of Her Majestie (next under\r\nGod), aboundently enjoy. This his bloodthirstie desire foreseene by the\r\nwisdome of our queene and counsayle, they helde no better meanes to curbe\r\nhis unjust pretenses, than by sendinge forces to invade him in that\r\nkingdome from whence hee hath feathers to flye to the toppe of his high\r\ndesires; they knowing that if for two or three yeeres a blowe were given\r\nhim there, that might hinder the coming into Spaine of his treasure;\r\nhis povertie, by reason of his daily huge payments, would be so great,\r\nand his men of warre, most of them mercenaries, that assuredly would\r\nfall from him, so woulde he have more neede of meanes to keepe his owne\r\nterritories, than he nowe hath of superfluitie to thruste into others\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThis invasion was spoken of in June 1594, a longe time before it was put\r\nin execution; and it beinge partly resolved on, Sir Francis Drake was\r\nnamed generall in November folowinge:—a man of greate spirit and fitt to\r\nundertake matters: in my poore opinion, better able to conduct forces and\r\ndiscreetly to governe in conductinge them to places where service was to\r\nbe done, than to comande in the execution thereof. But, assuredly, his\r\nvery name was a great terror to the enemie in all those partes, havinge\r\nheretofore done many thinges in those countries to his honorable fame\r\nand profitt. But entringe into them as the childe of fortune, it may be\r\nhis selfe-willed and peremptorie comand was doubted, and that caused\r\nHer Majestie, as should seeme, to joyne Sir John Hawkins in equall\r\ncommission:—a man oulde and warie, entering into matters with so laden a\r\nfoote, that the other’s meat woulde be eaten before his spit could come\r\nto the fire: men of so different natures and dispositions, that what the\r\none desireth the other would commonly oppose against; and though their\r\nwarie cariages sequestred it from meaner wittes, yet was it apparently\r\nseen to better judgements before our going from Plymouth, that whom the\r\none loved, the other smaly esteemed. Agreeing best, for what I could\r\nconjecture, in giving out a glorious title to their intended jorneye,\r\nand in not so well victualinge the navie as, I deeme, was Her Majestie’s\r\npleasure it shoulde bee, both of them served them to goode purpose, for,\r\nfrom this havinge the distributinge of so great sommes, their miserable\r\nprovidinge for us would free them from incurringe any greate losse,\r\nwhatsoever befel of the jorney. And the former drewe unto them so greate\r\nrepaire of voluntaries[1] that they had choice to discharge suche fewe as\r\nthey had pressed, and to enforce the staye of others who gladly would\r\nbe partakers of their voyage. But notwithstandinge matters were very\r\nforward, and that they had drawen together three thousand men, and had\r\nready furnished twenty-seven shippes, whereof six were Her Majestie’s,\r\nyet many times was it very doubtfull whether the jorney should proceed;\r\nand had not the newes of a gallion of the King of Spaine, which was\r\ndriven into St. John de Porterico with two millions and a halfe of\r\ntresure, come unto them by the reporte of certaine prisoners, whereof\r\nthey advertised Her Majestie, it is very likely it had been broken; but\r\nHer Majestie, persuaded by them of the easie takinge therof, comanded\r\nthem to haste their departure.\r\n\r\nSo on Thursday, being the 28th of August, in the year 1595, havinge\r\nstayed two moneth in Plimouth, we went thence twenty-seven sail, and\r\nwere two thousand five hundred men of all sortes. This fleet was devided\r\ninto two squadrons; not that it was so appointed by Her Majestie, for\r\nfrom her was granted as powerfull authoritie unto eyther of them over\r\nthe whole as any parte, but Sir Francis victualinge the one halfe and\r\nSir John the other, it made them, as men afectinge what they had done,\r\nto chalenge a greater prerogative over them than the whole; wherin they\r\nwronged themselves and the action, for wee had not runne sixty or seventy\r\nleagues in our course, before a flagge of councell was put out in the\r\nGarlande, unto which all commanders with the chiefe masters and gentlemen\r\nrepayred. Sir Francis complayned that he had a three hundred men more in\r\nhis squadron then were in the other, and that he was much pestered in\r\nhis owne shipp, wherof he would gladly be eased. Sir John gave no other\r\nhearinge to this motion, but seemed to dislike that he should bring more\r\nthan was concluded betwixt them, and this drewe them to some cholericke\r\nspeeches. But Sir John would not receave any unles he were entreated:\r\nto this Sir Francis’ stout hearte could never be driven. This was on\r\nthe second of September, and after they were somwhat qualified, they\r\nacquainted us that Sir Thomas Baskerville, our coronell generall, was\r\nof theyr counsayle by vertue of the broade seale, and that they would\r\ntake unto them Sir Nicholas Clifforde and the other captains appointed\r\nby Her Majestie, who were, eleven for the land, four for the shippes in\r\nwhich they themselves went not. They gave us instructions for directinge\r\nour course, if, by foule weather or mischange, any should be severed,\r\nand orders what alowances we should put our men into for preservation\r\nof victualls, with other necessary instructions. In the end, Sir John\r\nrevealed the places whither wee were bound, in hearinge of the basest\r\nmariner; observinge therin no warlike or provident advice, nor was it\r\never amended to the time of theyr deaths, but so he named St. John de\r\nPorterico, where the treasure before spoken of was to be taken, even\r\nwithoute blowes, from whence we should go direct to Nombre de Dios, and\r\nso over land to Panama. What other things should fall out by the way, he\r\nesteemed them not worth the naminge, this being sufficient to make a far\r\ngreater armie rich to theyr content.\r\n\r\nSome seven or eight days after this, we were called aborde the Defiance,\r\nwhere, Sir Francis Drake propoundinge unto us whether we should give upon\r\nthe Canaries or Maderas (for he was resolved to put for one of them by\r\nthe way), we seeinge his bent and the earnestnes of the coronel generall,\r\ntogether with the apparent likelihood of profit, might soon have bin\r\ndrawen therto; but consideringe the weightie matters we had undertaken\r\nand how needfull it was to hasten us thether [we did not immediately\r\nassent]. But General Hawkins utterly mislikinge this motion, it beinge\r\na matter, as hee saide, never before thought of, [he declared he] knewe\r\nno cause why the fleete should staye in any place till they came to the\r\nIndies, unles it should be by his takinge in of so greate numbers to\r\nconsume his waters and other provision; the which, if Sir Francis would\r\nacknowledge, hee would ridde him and relieve him the best hee could. Now\r\nthe fyer which laye hid in theyr stomacks began to breake forth, and had\r\nnot the coronell pacified them, it would have growen farther; but theyr\r\nheat somwhat abated, and they concluded to dine next day aboarde the\r\nGarlande with Sir John, when it was resolved that we should put for the\r\nGrand Canaries, though, in my conscience, whatsoever his tonge saide, Sir\r\nJohn’s harte was againste.\r\n\r\nThese matters were well qualified, and for that place we shaped our\r\ncourse, in which we met with a small flemminge bounde for the Streights\r\nand a small manne of warre of Waymouth, who kept us companie to the\r\nCanaries. On Wensday, the twenty-fourth day, we had sight of Lancerotta\r\nand Forteventura. The twenty-fifth at night we descried the Canaries,\r\nit beinge a monthe after our departure from Plymouth. On Friday, beinge\r\nthe twenty-sixth, we came to anchor, some saker shott from a forte which\r\nstands to the west norwest of the harboure. Sir Francis spent much time\r\nin seekinge out the fittest place to land; the enemie therby gaininge\r\ntime to drawe theyr forces in rediness to impeach our approach. At length\r\nwe puttinge for the shore in our boats and pinnaces, found a great seege\r\nand such power of men to encounter us, that it was then thought it would\r\nhazarde the whole action if we should give further upon it, wherupon\r\nwe returned without recevinge or doinge any harme worthy the writinge;\r\nbut, undoubtedly, had we lanced under the forte at our first cominge to\r\nanchor, wee had put fayre to bee possessors of the towne, for the delayes\r\ngave the enemie greate stomackes and daunted our owne; and it beinge the\r\nfirst service our new men were brought into, it was to be doubted they\r\nwould prove the worse the whole jorney followinge.\r\n\r\nWe presently wayed hence and came to anchor the twenty-seventh at the\r\nwest south west part of this islande, where wee watered. Here Captaine\r\nGrimstone, one of the twelve captaines for lande, was slaine by\r\nthe mountainors, with his boy and a surgeon. Hence wee departed the\r\ntwenty-eighth, houldinge our course south-west three weeks, then we\r\nran west south west and west and by south till the twenty-seventh of\r\nOctober, on which day we had sight of Maten, an island lying south-est\r\nfrom Dominica. Our generalls ment to water at Guadalupe, for Dominica\r\nbeinge inhabited by Indians, our men straglinge soon would have their\r\nthroates cutte. Generall Drake lyinge ahead the fleet, ran in by the\r\nmouth of Dominica, Sir John by south. The twenty-ninth we anchored under\r\nGuadalupe; Sir Francis beinge there a daye before us. On the thirtieth,\r\nJosias, captaine of the Delight, brought newes to the generalls, that the\r\nFrancis, a small shippe of companie, was taken by nine frigotts, wherupon\r\nSir Francis would presently have folowed them either with the whole\r\nfleete or some parte, for that he knew our intentions were discovered\r\nby reason they were so openly made knowne, as I afore have set downe,\r\nby Sir John Hawkins. Sir John would in no wise agree to eyther of these\r\nmotions, and he was assisted in his opinion by Sir Nicholas Clifforde,\r\nall others furtheringe his desires, which might be a means to staye them\r\nfor goinge into Porterico before us; but Sir John prevayled, for that hee\r\nwas sickly, Sir Francis beinge loth to breed his further disquiet. The\r\nreason of his stay was, to trimme his shippes, mounte his ordinance, take\r\nin water, set by some new pinnaces, and to make things in that rediness,\r\nthat he cared not to meet with the king’s whole fleete. Heere we stayed\r\ndoinge these necessaries three dayes. This is a desarte, and was without\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of November we departed, and being becalmed under the lee\r\nof the land, Sir Francis caused the Richarde, one of the victuallers,\r\nto be unladen and sunk. The eighth wee anchored amonge the Virginees,\r\nother west ilandes: heere we drew our companie on shore, that every man\r\nmight knowe his colours, and wee founde our companie shorte of the one\r\nthousand two hundred promised for lande service, few of the captains\r\nhaving above ninety, most not eighty, some not fifty; which fell out\r\npartly for that the generalls had selected to them a companie for theyr\r\nguarde, of many of the gallantest men of the army. Sir John his sicknes\r\nincresed. Sir Francis apointed captaines to the merchants’ shippes: this\r\nconsumed time till the eleventh, when we passed a sounde, though, by\r\nour mariners, never passed by fleet afore, and we came to anchor before\r\nPorterico on the twelfth, about three of the clocke in the afternoone,\r\nat what time Sir John Hawkins died. I made my men ready presently to\r\nhave landed, knowinge that our sodaine resolution would greatly have\r\ndanted the enemie, and have held our [own men] in opinion of assured\r\nvictory; but I was countermanded by authoritie, and during the time\r\nof our deliberation, the enemie labored by all meanes to cause us to\r\ndisankar, so workinge, that within an houre hee had planted three or\r\nfour pieces of artillery upon the shore next unto us, and playinge upon\r\nthe Defiance, knowing her to be the Admirall, whilest our generalls sate\r\nat souper with Sir Nicholas Clifford and diverse other, a shotte came\r\namongst them, wherwith Sir Nicholas, Brute, Brown, Captain Strafford, who\r\nhad Greenstone’s company, and some standers by, were hurte. Sir Nicholas\r\ndied that night, so secondinge Sir John Hawkins in his death as he did\r\nin his opinion at Guadalupe. My brother Browne lived five or six days\r\nafter, and died much bewayled. This shotte made our generall to way and\r\nfall further to the westward, where we rode safely. The five frigotts\r\nbefore spoken of rode within their forts: wee had no place nowe to lande\r\nour men but within them in the face of the towne, which was dangerous,\r\nfor that both shippes and forts could playe on us; it was therefore\r\nconcluded that boats should fire them where they rode. Captain Poore and\r\nmysealfe had the comande of this service; for the regiments, Captain\r\nSalisburie comandinge; the grand captain companye was sent by the\r\ngeneralls; diverse sea commanders were also sent; and on the thirteenth\r\nat night passinge in harde under the forte, we set three of them on fire;\r\nonly one of which, it was my chance to undertake, was burnt; on the\r\nothers, the fire held not by reason that being once out they were not\r\nmaintained with newe. The burnte shippe gave a greate light, the enemie\r\nthereby playinge upon us with their ordinance and small shotte as if it\r\nhad been fayre daye, and sinkinge some of our boates: a man could hardly\r\ncomande his mariners to row, they foolishly thinkinge every place more\r\ndangerous than where they were, when, indeede, none was sure. Thus doinge\r\nno harme, we returned with two or three prisoners, when, indeede, in\r\nmy poore oppinion, it had binne an easier matter to bringe them out of\r\nthe harborowe than fire them as wee did, for our men aboard the shippes\r\nnumbred five thousand one hundred and sixty peeces of artillerie that\r\nplayed on us during this service; and it had binne less dangerous to have\r\nabidden them close in the frigotts and in the darke than as wee did;\r\nbut great comanders many tymes fayle in theyre judgment, beinge crost\r\nby a compartner; but I had cause of more griefe than the Indies could\r\nyielde mee of joye, losinge my Alfierez,[2] Davis Pursell; Mr. Vaughan,\r\na brother-in-law of Sir John Hawkins, with three others; Thomas Powton,\r\nwith five or six more hurte and maimed; and was somwhat discomfited,\r\nfor the generall feigned heere to set up his rest; but examininge the\r\nprisoners, by whom hee understoode that these frigotts were sent for his\r\ntreasure, and that they would have fallen amonge us at Guadalupe had\r\nthey not taken the Francis, his minde altered: callinge to counsaile, he\r\ncomanded us to give our opinions what we thought of the strength of the\r\nplace. Most thought it would hazard the whole action. But one Rush, a\r\ncaptaine, more to mee aleadged that without better puttinge for it, [than\r\nby] the bare lookinge upon the outside of the forts, we could hardly\r\ngive such judgment; and I set it playnely under my hande, that if we\r\nresolutely attempted it, all was ours; and that I persuaded mysealfe no\r\ntowne in the Indies could yielde us more honnor or profitte. The generall\r\npresently saide: “I will bring thee to twenty places farre more wealthye\r\nand easier to be gotten.” Such-like speeches I thinke had bewitched the\r\ncoronell for he most desired him to hasten him hence.\r\n\r\nThe enemie, the day after we had fired the frigotts, suncke together four\r\nto save us labour, but chiefly to strengthen their fortes: two other\r\ngreate shippes they suncke and fired in the mouth of the harborowe to\r\ngive them light to playe on us from theyr fortes as we entred the first\r\nnight. And hence we went the fifteenth. Heere I left all hope of good\r\nsuccesse.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth we came to anchor in a fayre baye (the baye of Sta.\r\nJermana), at the westermost part of the ilande, where wee stayed till\r\nthe twenty-fourth, settinge up more newe pinnaces and unlodinge the\r\nother newe victualler, the generall takinge the most parte into his owne\r\nshippe as he did of the former. Captaine Yorke, in the Hope, was made\r\nvice-admirall. This is a very pleasant and fertile ilande, having upon\r\nit goode store of cattell, fruites, and fish, with all thinges necessary\r\nto man’s sustenance; and were it well manured, no place could yielde\r\nit in greater abundance or better. Departing hence, we had our course\r\nfor Corasaw.[3] The seconde daye after our puttinge of, the Exchange, a\r\nsmall shippe, spronge her mast, and was sunke; the men and parte of the\r\nvictualls were saved by other shippes. Twenty-ninth.—Upon Corasaw there\r\nis great store of cattell and goates, and we fell with it upon Saturday\r\nthe twenty-ninth; but our generall, deceaved by the currante and westerly\r\ncourse, made it for Arabir,[4] an iland lyinge ten or twelve leagues\r\nto the westwarde, and so made no staye; when, next morninge descryenge\r\nwhether hee founde his error, wee bore with Cape De la Vela, and from\r\nthence our coronell, with all the companies in the pinnaces and boates\r\nwere sent to the cittie of Rio de la Hacha, and with small resistance\r\nwee tooke it the first of December at night. The generall came unto us\r\nthe next morning with the fleete. This towne was left bare of goodes:\r\nthe inhabitants havinge intelligence of our cominge, had caried all in\r\nthe woodes, and hid theyr treasure in casshes;[5] but, stayinge heere\r\nseventeen days, wee made so goode search, that little remained unfounde\r\nwithin four leagues of the towne. We tooke many prisoners, Spaniards and\r\nnegroes, some slaves repairinge to us voluntarily. The generall with two\r\nhundred men went in boates to Lancheria, which is a place where they fish\r\nfor pearle, standinge ten leagues to the estwarde of theyr towne, from\r\nwhence they brought goode store of pearle, and tooke a carvell, in which\r\nwas some monie, wine, and myrr.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay heere, the governor once, diverse others often, repaired\r\nunto us to redeeme theyr towne, Lancheria, boates and slaves. They did\r\nthis to gaine time to convey away the kinge’s treasure and to advertyse\r\ntheyr neighbour towne to convey their treasure in more safetye then\r\nthemselves had done; for the whole (except the slaves who voluntarily\r\nrepayred unto us) was yielded unto them for twenty-four thousand peasos,\r\nfive shillings and sixpence a peece, to bee payde in pearles; bringinge\r\nthese to theyr towne at the daye and valuinge in double the price they\r\nwere worth. Our generall delivered the hostages and set their towne\r\n(Lancheria) and boates on fire, carryinge their slaves with us. The\r\nwealth we had heere was given to countervayle the charge of the jorney;\r\nbut I feare it will not so prove in the end. Our vice-admirall, Captaine\r\nYorcke, died heere of sicknes. This is an exceedinge goode countrye,\r\nchampion and well inhabited; great store of cattayle, horses, sheepe,\r\ngoates, fish, and fowle, wheron wee fedde, but smale store of graine or\r\nfruite neere the towne, rich only in pearle and cattell.\r\n\r\nThe twentieth, being Saturday, we came to St. Tomarta.[6] We suncke\r\ntwo catches before we came to Rio de la Hacha, which we brought out of\r\nEngland. Presently, upon our coming to anchors, we landed and gave upon\r\nthe town. We found small resistance more than a fewe shotte playinge out\r\nof the woodes as we marched towards the towne. Companies were presently\r\nsent abroade to discover and searche the countrye. The inhabitants had to\r\nlong forewarninge to carry theyr goods out of our possibilitie to find\r\nthem in so short time; little or nothing of valew was gotten, only the\r\nLeiftenant-governor and some others were taken prisoners; and firyinge\r\nthe towne the twenty-first, we departed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Worrell, our trenchmaster, died at this towne of sicknes. This\r\nwas a very prettie towne, and six leagues off there was a gould mine.\r\nIf part of our companie had been sent thither upon our first arrival\r\nat Rio de la Hacha, doubtles we had done much goode, but now they had\r\nscrube it very bare. In this place was great store of fruite and much\r\nfernandobuck;[7] for that the winde blewe so extremely, and the rode\r\nwilde, we could not shippe it. Before we departed hence, it was concluded\r\nthat we should passe Cartagena and go directly for Nombre de Dios. We\r\nanchored in the rode on Sunday followinge, beinge the twenty-seventh;\r\nand landinge presently, receavinge some small shotte from the towne, we\r\nfounde small resistance more than a little forte at the east side of\r\ntheyr towne, in which they had left one peece of ordinance which brake\r\nat the first shotte. They gave upon us as we gave upon them: certaine\r\nprisoners were taken in the flyinge, who made it knowne, that havinge\r\nintelligence, longe before, of our cominge, theyr treasure was conveyed\r\nto places of more safetie, eyther to Panama or secretly hidden; and it\r\nmight very well bee, for the towne was left very bare; wherefore it was\r\nresolved that we should hasten with speed for Panama. Nombre de Dios\r\nstandeth on the north-side sea, Panama upon the south, distant some\r\neighteen or nineteen leagues. There were only two wayes to get thither;\r\none by the river Chagree, which lyeth to the westward twenty leagues;\r\nupon this it is passable within five leagues of Panama: the other through\r\ndeserts and over mountaines voide of inhabitants: this was troublesom\r\nand harde, as well for want of means to carry our provision of meate\r\nand munition as for the ill passage with an armie through these deserts\r\nand unknown places. That by the river our generall held more dangerous,\r\nfayninge there was no place for our fleet to wade safely. This made our\r\ncoronell to yeelde to the waye by the mountaine, though he and others\r\nforesawe the danger before our settinge hence; but he resolved to make\r\ntryall of what coulde be done.\r\n\r\nSo on Monday the twenty-ninth we began our jorney, takinge with us the\r\nstrongest and lustiest of our armie, to the number of fifty men and\r\nseven colours. Before our settinge hence, we buried Captaine Arnolde\r\nBaskerville, our serjant-major generall, a gallant gentleman. The first\r\ndaye we marched three leagues; the next, six leagues, where we came to\r\na greate house which the enemie had sett on fire, it beinge a place\r\nwhere the kinge’s mules do use to lodge cominge from Panama to Nombre de\r\nDios with his treasure: it is the midway betwixt both places. The house\r\nwould receave five hundred horses. We had not marched fully a league on\r\nWednesday morninge, when we came to a place fortified upon the toppe of\r\nan hill, which the enemie defended. We had noe other way to passe nor\r\nnoe means to make our approach but a very deepe lande, where but one\r\ncould passe at once, unles it were by clammeringe upon the bancks and\r\ncreepinge up the hill through the brakes, which some of our men did, and\r\ncame to the trees which they had plasshed to make theyr palizadoe, over\r\nwhich they coulde not passe, the many bowes so hindered them. It was my\r\nchance, clammeringe up the banckes to repaire to three musketters which\r\nI had holpen up, to fall directly betwixt two of theyr places fortified,\r\ncominge unto two paths by which they fetched their water, and givinge\r\npresently upon them, the place being open, my small number found to goode\r\nresistance, and I was driven to retire with the losse of these fewe.\r\nHeere was the only place to beate them from theyr houlde, wherof I sent\r\nthe coronell worde, Captaine Poore and Bartlett and others repayringe to\r\nme. I shewed them the path; we heard the enemie plasshinge and fellinge\r\nof trees farre before us. The coronell sent for us to come unto him: he\r\ndebated with us what he foresaw before our cominge from Nombre de Dios,\r\nand though he thought, in his oppinion, we should feare the enemie hence,\r\nyet, havinge retreits upon retreits, they would kill our best men without\r\ntakinge little or any hurte themselves; and our men began to drop apace;\r\nour powder and match were spoilde by much rain and waters which we had\r\npassed, unles it were such as som of our souldiers had with more care\r\npreserved. The provision for meate at our coming from Nombre de Dios was\r\nseven or eight cakes of bisked or ruske for a man, which was eyther by\r\nwette spoyled, or theyr greediness had devoured; so there remained to\r\nfewe one daye’s bread; to most none at all. Our hurte men, as Captaine\r\nNicholas Baskerville and some other of accounte, we should be driven to\r\nleave to the mercie of the enemie, unles they could houlde companie.\r\nBefore our cominge to Panama, had we beaten them from all these houlds,\r\nwhich I think would have bin to dangerous for us to have attempted,\r\nconsideringe the estate we were in, we must have fought with them at a\r\nbridge where they had intrenched themselves in a far greater number than\r\nwe were; and it is manifest, if we had not within three days gotten some\r\nreleife, we had bin overthrowen, though no enemie had fought against\r\nus. But our stomacks callinge these, with other dangers, to his carefull\r\nconsideration, he resolved to retire, and so commanded us to cause the\r\nslaine to be throwne out of sight, the hurte to be sent to the quarter\r\nfrom whence we came that morninge, and the rest to be drawen away. Heere\r\nwere slaine Captaine Marchant, our quarter-master, with some other\r\nofficers, gentlemen, and souldiers. Upon our coming to the quarter, the\r\ncoronell took view of the hurte, and for such as could ride he procured\r\nall the horses of the armie; for the other, he entreated the enemie to\r\nentreate them kindly, as they expected the like from us towards theyrs,\r\nof which we had a farre greater number.\r\n\r\nOn the seconde of January we returned to Nombre de Dios; our men so\r\nwearied with the ilnes of the waye, sur-baited for want of shoes, and\r\nweake with theyr diet, that it would have bin a poor dayes service that\r\nwe should have done upon an enimie had they been there to resist us.\r\nI am persuaded that never armie, great or small, undertooke a march\r\nthrough to unknown places so weakly provided and with so small means to\r\nhelp themselves, unles it might be some few goinge covertly to do som\r\nsodaine exploite before it were thought of by the enemie, and so returne\r\nunspied; for, undoubtedly, two hundred men foreknowinge their intentions\r\nand provided with all things necessarie, are able to breake or weaken the\r\ngreatest force that any prince in Christendome can bringe thither, if he\r\nhad place to finde more than we had. This marche had made many swere that\r\nhe will never venture to buy gould at such a price againe. I confesse\r\nnoble spiritts, desirous to do service to theyr prince and country, may\r\nsoon be persuaded to all hardnes and danger; but havinge once made tryall\r\ntherof, would be very loth, as I suppose, to carry any force that way\r\nagaine; for beholdinge it in many places, a man would judge it dangerous\r\nfor one man to passe alone, almost impossible for horses and an armie.\r\n\r\nThe daye that our generall had newes of our returne, he ment to way and\r\nfall nearer to the river Chagree with the fleete, leavinge some few to\r\nbringe us if we were enforced to retire, wherof hee little doubted. But\r\nbeinge beaten from the place where it appeered all his hopes rested\r\nfor gayninge to himselfe and others this masse of treasure which he\r\nso confidently promised before, it was high time for him to devise of\r\nsome other course. Wherfore, on the fourth of January, he called us\r\nto counsayle, and debated with us what was nowe to be done. All these\r\nparties had notice long before of all our intentions, as it appeered by\r\nletters written from the governor of Lima to the governor of Panama and\r\nNumbre de Dios, givinge them advice to be carefull and to looke well to\r\nthemselves, for that Drake and Hawkins were makinge readie in England to\r\ncome upon them. Lima is distant from these places more than three hundred\r\nleagues, all overlayed with snakes. It appeareth that they had good\r\nintelligence. This made them to convey theyr treasure to places which\r\nthey resolved to defend with better force than we were able to attempt.\r\nLike as upon the cominge of the sun, dewes and mistes begin to vanish,\r\nso our blinded eyes began now to open, and wee founde that the glorious\r\nspeeches, of an hundred places that they knew in the Indies to make\r\nus rich, was but a baite to drawe Her Majestie to give them honorable\r\nemployments and us to adventure our lives for theyr glory; for now cards\r\nand mappes must bee our cheefest directors, hee beinge in these partes at\r\nthe furthest limit of his knowledge. There hee found out a place called\r\nLaguna de Nichoragua, upon which standeth certaine townes, as Granada,\r\nLeon, and others; also the bay of Honduras, a place knowne to be of\r\nsmall wealth by itsealfe, unles it be brought thither to be imbarqued\r\nfor Spaine. He demanded which of those we would attempt; our coronell\r\nsaide, bothe, one after another, and all to little to content us if wee\r\ntooke them. It was then resolved that we should first for the river, and\r\nas matters fell out, for the other. Numbre de Dios, together with their\r\nnegroe towne were fyred; and we suncke and fyred fourteen small frigotts\r\nwhich we founde in the rode. We gott here twenty barres of silver, with\r\nsom gould and certaine plate; more would have benne founde, had it bene\r\nwell sought; but our generall thought it folly to gather our harvest\r\ngraine by graine, beinge so likely at Panama to thrust our handes into\r\nthe whole heapes: and after our returne, beinge troubled in minde, hee\r\nseemed little to regard any consayle that should be given him to that\r\npurpose, but to hasten thence as fast as he might. This is a most wealthy\r\nplace, being setled upon a grounde full of camphyre, environed with hilly\r\nwoodes and mountaines, the bottom a dampish fen. Hence wee departed the\r\nfifth, and held our course for Nichragua.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth we founde a very deepe and dangerous baye, playinge it\r\nhere up and downe: all men weary of the place. The tenth we descried a\r\nsmall iland called Escudes, where we came to anchor: and here we tooke a\r\nfrygotte which was an advice of the kinge’s. By this we learned that the\r\ntownes standinge upon this lake, were of small wealth and very dangerous,\r\nby reason of many shoals and greate roughes our mariners should have, it\r\nbeinge an hundred leagues: yet if the winde would have permitted, we had\r\nassuredly put for them, and never returned to one halfe againe. Heere we\r\nstayed, at a waste island where there was no reliefe but a few tortoyses\r\nfor such as could catch them, twelve days. This is counted the sickliest\r\nplace of the Indies; and heere died many of our men, victualls beginninge\r\nto growe scarse with us. In the end, findinge the winde to continue\r\ncontrary, he resolved to departe, and to take the winde as God sent it.\r\n\r\nSo on the twenty-second we went hence, having there buried Captaine\r\nPlott, Egerton, and divers others. I questioned with our generall, beinge\r\noften private with him whilst we stayed heere, to see whether hee would\r\nreveale unto mee any of his purposes; and I demanded of him, why hee so\r\noften conjured me, beinge in England, to stay with him in these partes\r\nas longe as himselfe, and where the place was. He answered me with\r\ngriefe, protestinge that hee was as ignorant of the Indies as mysealfe,\r\nand that he never thought any place could be so changed, as it were from\r\na delitious and pleasant arbour into a wast and desarte wildernesse;\r\nbesides the variableness of the winde and weather, so stormie and\r\nblusterous as hee never sawe it before. But hee most wondred that since\r\nhis cominge out of England he never sawe sayle worth givinge chace unto:\r\nyet in the greatness of his minde, hee would, in the end, conclude with\r\nthese wordes: “It matters not, man; God hath many thinges in store for\r\nus; and I knowe many means to do Her Majestie good service and to make\r\nus riche, for we must have gould before wee see Englande”; when, goode\r\ngentleman, (in my conceite) it fared with him as with some careles\r\nlivinge man who prodigally consumes his time, fondly perswadinge himselfe\r\nthat the nurse that fedde him in his childhood will likewise nourish him\r\nin his ould age, and, finding the dugge dried and withered, enforced then\r\nto behould his folly, tormented in mind, dieth with a starved bodie. Hee\r\nhad, beside his own adventure, gaged his owne reputation greatly, in\r\npromisinge Her Majestie to do her honorable service, and to returne her\r\na very profitable adventure; and havinge sufficiently experienced, for\r\nseven or eight years together, how hard it was to regain favour once ill\r\nthought of, the mistresse of his fortune now leavinge him to yield to a\r\ndiscontented minde. And since our returne from Panama he never caried\r\nmirth nor joy in his face; yet no man hee loved must conjecture that\r\nhee tooke thought thereof. But heere hee began to grow sickly. At this\r\niland we suncke a carvell which we brought out of England, puttinge her\r\nmen and victualls into a last taken frigott. From hence a great currante\r\nsetts towards the estward; by reason wherof, with the scant of winde\r\nwe had on Wednesday, beinge the twenty-eight, we came to Portabella,\r\nwhich is within eight or nine leagues of Numbre de Dios. It was the best\r\nharborough we came unto sence we left Plymouth.\r\n\r\nThis morninge, about seven of the clocke, Sir Francis died. The next day\r\nSir Thomas Baskerville caried him a league of, and buried him in the sea.\r\nIn this place, the inhabitants of Numbre de Dios meant to build a towne,\r\nit beinge far more healthye than where they dwell. Heere they began a\r\nforte which alreadie cost the kinge seven thousand purses, and a fewe\r\nhouses towards their town, which they called Civitas Sti. Philippi. Them\r\nwe fired, rasinge the fortification to the grounde. Heere we found, as in\r\nother places, all abandoned; theyr ordinance cast into the sea, some of\r\nwhich we founde, and caried aboard the Garland.\r\n\r\nOur generalls beinge dead, most men’s heartes were bent to hasten for\r\nEngland as soon as they might; but Sir Thomas Baskervile havinge the\r\ncomand of the armie by vertue of Her Majestie’s broad seale, endeavoured\r\nto prevent the disseveringe of the fleet, and to that end, talked\r\nwith such as hee hearde intended to quite companie before they were\r\ndisembogued, and drew all companies to subscribe to certaine articles\r\nsignifyinge our purposes—viz., that puttinge hence, wee should turne\r\nit backe to St. Tomarto[8] if the winde would suffer us, otherwise to\r\nrun over for Jamaica, where it was thought we should bee refreshed with\r\nsome victualls. Matters thus concluded, the Delight, the Elizabeth, and\r\nour late taken frigotts were suncke. Many of the negro men and base\r\nprisoners were here put on shore; and heere we wayed on Sunday the eighth\r\nof February. Our victualls began to shorten apace, yet we had lyen a\r\nlonge time at very harde alowance,—four men each morninge one quarte\r\nof beere and cake of biskett for diner, and for supper one quarte of\r\nbeere and two cakes of biskett and two cans of water, with a pinte of\r\npease or half a pinte of rise or somwhat more of oatemeale. This was\r\nour allowance beinge at Portabella and six weekes before, but that we\r\nhad sometime stockfish. From thence there is a current that sets to the\r\neastward, by the helpe of which, on the fourteenth, wee had sight of an\r\niland shorte of Carthagena fifteen or sixteen leagues; further than this\r\nwee could not go to the estward, for that the current had left us. The\r\nfifteenth at night, it beinge faire weather, we lost sight of our fleete.\r\nHeere as I grew discontented, knowinge it touched my poore regulation so\r\nto leave the armie; and I had many thinges to perswade mee that it was\r\ndone of purpose by the captaine and master, therby gaininge an excuse\r\nto departe; I shewed the captaine of the danger he should run into by\r\nleavinge so honorable forces when they had neede of our companie: and God\r\nknoweth that had I had but judgment which way to have cast for them, I\r\nwould rather have lost my life then so forsake the like. He deposed on\r\nthe bible, and Christianitie made me believe him. But playinge it up and\r\ndowne about twelve of the clocke, and discoveringe none of them, the wind\r\nblew so contrary that the seamen affirmed by houldinge this course we\r\nshould be cast backe in the bay, and they perswaded that our fleete could\r\nnot attaine St. Tomarto, but were gone over for Jamaica, whither they\r\nwould follow then. I plainly forsaw that if we missed them there, it was\r\nlike that we should no more meete till we came to England, which would\r\nhave made me to perswade a longer search upon the maine; but my hope of\r\ntheir beinge there, together with the weakness of our men and the small\r\nmeanes we had to retaine them, fearinge lest my delay might endanger Her\r\nMajesties shippes and the whole companie, I yielded to theyr perswasions.\r\nWe were in ten degrees and a halfe when we put from hence, and we came\r\ntill the twenty-second, when we had sight of a very dangerous shoale\r\nwhich our seamen thought they had passed neare two dayes before. If we\r\nhad fallen with it in the night we had bin all lost. The shoale is named\r\nSecrana.\r\n\r\nOn Shrove Wensday, being the twenty-fourth, we fell with Jamaica, and\r\nby meanes of a Mulatow and an Indian, we had, this night, forty bundles\r\nof dried beife, which served our whole companie so many dayes. We came\r\nto anchor at the westermost parte of the iland, in a faire, sandie\r\nbay, where we watered, and stayed, in hope to have some newes of our\r\nfleete, seven dayes. This, our stay, brought no intelligence, wherfore\r\nour seamen thought that our fleet, not able to recover this place, were\r\nfallen eyther with Cape Corantes or Cape St. Antoine[9]; these places we\r\nment to touch in our course; and hence we went the first of March. On\r\nthe sixth we sawe a shippe on the leaward of us, and the next morninge\r\nwe made her to be the Pegasine, one of our fleete, who, as they sayde,\r\nlost the admirall neere the time as we did, beinge by the coronell sent\r\nto the Susan Bonaventure, whom they left in greate distresse, by reason\r\nof a lake they had taken, and I greatly feared, by theyr reporte, they\r\nare perished. There were in her one hundred and thirty or one hundred\r\nand forty persons, many gallant gentlemen and good men. If they perish,\r\nthis shippe shall repent it. Houldinge our course for these places, we\r\ndescried five sayles a stern of us. We stayed for them, and soone made\r\nthem to be none of our fleete; and we had good reason to perswade us they\r\nwere enimies. They had the winde of us, but we soone regained it upon\r\nthem, which made them, upon a peece of ordinance shott of by the greatest\r\nshippe, tacke about; we tackt with them; when the captain of this shippe\r\nfaithfully protested unto me not to shoote a peece of ordinance till we\r\ncame boord and boorde, and then I promised him, with our small shot, to\r\nwin the greatest or lose our persons. This we might have done without\r\nendangeringe Her Majestie’s shippes; but our enimie, playinge upon us\r\nwith theyr ordinance, made our gunners fall to it ere we were at musket\r\nshot, and no nearer could I bringe them, though I had no hope to take\r\nany of them but by boordinge. Heere we popt away powder and shott to\r\nno purpose, for most of our gunners would hardly have stricken Paule’s\r\nsteeple had it stoode there. I am a yonge seaman, yet my small judgment\r\nand knowledge makes me avowe, that never shippe of Her Majestie’s went\r\nso vilely manned out of her kingdom; not twenty of them worthy to come\r\ninto her shippes; and I know not what had possessed the captaine, but\r\nhis mind was cleane altered, tellinge me that he had no authoritie to\r\nlay any shippe aboorde, wherby he might endanger this, Her Majestie’s;\r\nand they beinge, as he sayd, the kinge’s men of warre, they would rather\r\nfire with us than be taken. Had I beene a marchant of her burden (God\r\nfavoringe me), they would have bin mine, as many as stoode to the tryall\r\nof theyr fortune; but the paltrie Pegosie we lately met withall never\r\ncame neere us by a league, which was some colour to our men to give them\r\nover. So after I had endeavored by mysealfe, my lewetenant and other\r\ngentlemen, by perswasion, to worke the captaine resolutely to attempt\r\nthem, and findinge no disposition in him but to consume powder and shott\r\nto no purpose, but firinge it in the ayer, I yielded to give them over,\r\nperswadinge mysealfe that God had even ordained that we should not with\r\nany nature attempt where we were resisted with never so weake forces.\r\nThus away we went, and the winde choppinge us southerly, our seamen held\r\nthat our fleete coulde neither ride at Corants nor at St. Antony, which\r\nmade me condescend to leave the Indies, with all her treasure, and to\r\nplye the next course to disembogue,[10] for little hope was left me that\r\nwe should do Her Majestie any service, or good to our selves, when, upon\r\nthe feigned excuses of endangering her shippes which she sent forth\r\nto fight if occasion were offered; and to perswade mysealfe that. Her\r\nMajestie priseth not her ships deerer than the lives of so many faithful\r\nsubjects, who gladly would have ventured theyr lives, and upon no\r\nbrain-sick humour, but from a trew desire to do Her Highness some service\r\nfor the charge and adventure she had been at in this glorious spoken-of\r\njorney. Fortune’s child was dead, thinges would not fall into our\r\nmouthes, nor riches be our portions, howe dearly soever we adventured for\r\nthem. Thus avoydinge Silla (after the proverbe), we felle into Charibdis,\r\nand indeede we were not nowe farre from it.\r\n\r\nOur master, a careful ould man, but not experienced upon these coastes,\r\nrather followinge the advice of others than relienge on his owne\r\njudgment, brought us, on the twelfth, three hours before daye, into\r\na very shallow water, upon a dangerous bancke, which some held to be\r\nthe Meltilettes, others for the Tortugas, eyther like enough to have\r\nswallowed us, had not God blest us with fayre weather. Freinge ourselves\r\nof this danger, upon Monday the fifteenth of March we entered the gulfe,\r\nand by ten of the clocke we brought the Cape of Florida west of us. On\r\nthe seventeenth (the Lord be thanked) we were disembogued. After this, we\r\nran with most fowle weather and contrary windes till the first of May,\r\nwhen we had soundinge in ninety fathoms, beinge in the Channell, and on\r\nthe third we had sight of Sylly; the which day, ere night, we came to\r\nanchor, (the Lord be therefore praysed) 1596.\r\n\r\nTo give mine oppinion of the Indies, I verily think that filchinge men\r\nof warre shall do more goode then such a fleete, if they have aine\r\nforewarninge of theyr cominge. And unles Her Majestie will undertake so\r\nroyally as to dispossesse him of the landes of Porterico, Hispaniola, and\r\nCuba, her charge will be greater in sendinge thither, then the profitt\r\nsuch a fleet can returne, for havinge but a fewe days warninge, it is\r\neasy for them to convey theyr goods into assured safetie, as experience\r\nhath taught us. Theyr townes they dare not redeeme, beinge enjoyned\r\nthe contrary by the kinge’s comandment. These places will be taken and\r\npossessed by two thousand men; and by this Her Majestie might debarre the\r\nkinge of Spain of his whole profitt of the Indies: and the first gaininge\r\nthem will return her a sufficient requittal for her adventure. God grant\r\nI may live to see such an enterprise put in practise; and the kinge of\r\nSpaine will speedily flye to what conditions of peace Her Majestie will\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nThus I have truly set down the whole discourse of our voyage, usinge\r\ntherin many idle wordes and ill-compared sentences. It was done on the\r\nsea, which I thinke can alter any disposition. Your loves, I thinke, can\r\npardon these faltes, and secret them from the vewe of others.\r\n\r\nThe first of March the fleete fell with the Pinnas,[11] on the land of\r\nCuba, which day they had sight of the Spanish fleete by eleven of the\r\nclocke; where Sir Thomas Baskervile gave directions for the fleete as\r\nthus:—the Garland, being admirall, with one halfe of the fleete to have\r\nthe vanguard; the Hope, beinge vice-admirall, with the other halfe, the\r\nrereward. The fight continued fiercely three hours within muskett shott.\r\nThat night they saw the Spanish Vice-admirall, a ship of seven hundred\r\ntonne, burned, with other six lost and suncke by the next morninge, when\r\nthey departed. The Hope received a leake and was forced to go from the\r\nfleete to an iland, called St. Crusado, inhabited by canniballs, where\r\nthey had store of hens and Indian wheate for nine weekes.

Coloma, y\r\naviendose allado[1] en la tormenta que corrio desembocada de la canal\r\na los 15 del dho mes en altura de 28 grados y medio, sin arbol mayor,\r\nrompido el timon, y la nao haciendo mucha agua, apartada de las demas,\r\nimposibilitada de seguir su viage, para salvar las vidas de 300 personas\r\nque en ella venian y dos millones de oro y plata de su Magestad y\r\nparticulares, con acuerdo y parecer del vehedor Martin Vomero de Caamaño\r\ny de los pilotos y demas personas platicas que alli se allaron, aribo a\r\nPuerto rico a donde bien milagrosamente llego a los 9 de April, y alli\r\ndesembarco y puso la Plata en la fortaleça de la ciudad. Luego el dho\r\ngeneral despacho a su Magestad primero y secundo aviso haciendoles saver\r\nsu ariba, para que mandase lo que hubiese de haçer, y parece que la\r\ndivina [providencia] permitio por secretos suyos que la orden, pudiendo\r\nser antes, llegare a tiempo que no solo aseguro la Plata sino esta tierra\r\ny seria posible todas las Yndias, por lo que adelante se vera, aquien se\r\npueden dar muchas gratias.\r\n\r\nPocos dias despues de aver despachado los dhos avisos, los tuvo de su\r\nMagestad el governador desta ysla Pedro Suares Coronel en que le aviso\r\nen que en Yngalaterra se aprestava una gruesa armada para venir aganar\r\nesta ysla en tiempo de embierno, por pareçer que entonçes estaria menos\r\napercevida. Entendidos por el general y el dho veedor los dhos avisos se\r\njuntaron con el governador y con Franᵒ. Cid, capitan de la ynfanteria\r\ndeste presidio, y tratado y conferido las preventiones que se debian\r\nhaçer para seguridad de la tierra y Plata de su Magestad para que en caso\r\nque el enemigo viniese no se apoderase de todo ello, fueron todos juntos\r\na reconecer los sitios y baraderos por donde el enemigo podia acometer\r\ny echar gente en tierra, y que en las partes que al general le parecio,\r\nmando plantar parte de la artilleria de su capitana y atravesar la nao\r\nen la canal del puerto, para que quando viniese el enemigo, se echase a\r\nfondo y sele çegase la entrada, pareciendo que por alli avia de acometer\r\ny lo demas riesgo, y contener la gente en buena guarida; se estubo en\r\nespera de la orden de su Magestad para hacer su viage.\r\n\r\nA los 13th de Nobiembre deste año llego a este puerto Don Pedro Tello de\r\nGuzman, con las cincas fragatas de su Magestad para que el general Sancho\r\nPardo embarcase en ella la plata de su Magestad y se fuese la buelta de\r\nespaña, haciendo officio de su Almirante el dho Pedro Tello, el qual\r\ndespues de aver entregado sus despachos, le dijo al dho general como\r\nviniendo en seguimiento de su viage, avian encontrado dos navios yngleses\r\nen la ysla de Guadalupe, que se avian apartado de la armada ynglesa y\r\nque su almirante Gonçalo Mendez de Canço avia rendido y echado a fondo\r\nel uno, despues de aver le sacado os yngleses prisiones y que yendo el\r\ndho Don Pedro en seguimiento del otro navio descubrio nueve velas de la\r\narmada del enemigo, y desque las vio viro la otra buelta siguiendo su\r\nviage; y que los dhos yngleses prisioneros avian declarado que cerca\r\nde alli en la misma ysla de Guadalupe a la banda del sur, estava surta\r\nla armada de la reyna de yngalaterra, y aprestando lanchas con veinte\r\ny cinco navios, los seis de los galeones de la reyna de 800 toneladas\r\ny otros dos del mesmo porte de particulares, y todos en dos esquadras,\r\ny por generales Franᵒ. Draque y Juan Aquines, governando la derota y\r\ncosas de tierra Franᵒ. Draque y su lugarteniente en tierra Don Thomas\r\nVasquezarfil; y que traia la armada 30[2] infantes y 10,500 marineros\r\nbien artillados, y que venian derechos a Puerto rico, como parecia por la\r\nynstruccion que se le tomo al capitan del dho navio yngles en la qual se\r\nle ordeno en caso que por alguno forçoso se apartase, viniese a Puerto\r\nrico, donde le aguardarian 10 dias, y que alli se dexarian orden adonde\r\navian de yr despues, sin declarar otro disegno; y que conforme a esto el\r\ndho Don Pedro venia temeroso que no ubiese venido delante y estubiese\r\nganada la tierra, y que puesto no avia sido, tenia por cierto que aes\r\notro dia estaria sobre el puerto, y que conforme a esto el general\r\nordenase su partida como mas pareciese combenir.\r\n\r\nVisto el general Sancho Pardo la relacion del dho Don Pedro Tello y\r\nsu Almirante Gonçalo Mendez y que esta nueba le allava en la cama\r\ny indispuesto de enfermidad, de algunos dias avia estava con ella,\r\nhiço avisar a Obispo y al governador, pidiendoles se viesen con el y\r\nlos capitanes de fragatas Marco Antonio Becerra, cabo de la compania\r\nde Arcabuçeros, y Pedro de Guia del avito de San Juan, y Domingo de\r\nYnsaurraga, Franᵒ. Gomez, capitan deste presidio, y el veedor Martin\r\nVomero de Caamaño, Juan de la Vera, contador de las fragatas; y todos\r\njuntos en su posada y aviendo tratado y propuesto el dho general la\r\nrelacion que tenia del enemigo y los medios mas combenientes que avia\r\npor la seguridad de la tierra y plata; supuesto que la armada enemiga\r\nera tanta y esperarse tan breve, y que las fragatas precisamente tenian\r\nnecesidad de adereçarse y meter agua y leña y embarcarse la plata en\r\nque se avian de detener ocho dias por lo menos, y considerando que el\r\nenemigo quando estuviese con esta ocupacion, y quando no por el aviso que\r\nle pudo dar el otro navio que se vio, que estas fragatas venian por la\r\nplata que ya savia que estava aqui, la podia esperar al paso, oque de la\r\ntierra se podia apoderar y fortificarse en ella para conquistar a todas\r\nlas Yndias, en que a su Magestad leseguia gran perjucio y daño de su\r\nreputacion.\r\n\r\nTodos de unanime conformes acordaron que la tierra se fortificase con la\r\nartilleria y gente, y que la nao capitana de tierra firme y otro de Pedro\r\nMilanes se echasen a fondo en la canal del puerto para çegar la entrada,\r\ny que la plata no se mudase de la fortaleça asta ver como las cosas se\r\nponian, pareciendo estara alli mas segura y en parte donde quando per\r\nnuestros pecados se lo ordenava, se pudiera echar al a mar paraque no la\r\ngoçase el enemigo, y con esta resolucion sean ydo poniendo en execution\r\ncon mucha priesa y diligencia de noche y de dia todas prevençiones\r\nposibles.\r\n\r\nEl general Sancho Pardo como persona de tanta experientia y que tenia\r\nvisto y reconoçido los sitios y puertos de la tierra, aseguro al dho Don\r\nPedro Tello y a los que con el venian, que era caso ymposible perderse la\r\ntierra quiriendo los nuestros pelear y haçer el deber, y que solo avia\r\ntener cuidado del puerto, que la armada no se metiese de golpe, y que par\r\neso era bien se echasen a fondo las dos naos que estava acordado, y en\r\nsus espaldas las fragatas con las proas a la mar par resistir la entrada,\r\ny que con eso estava segura la tierra y plata de su Magestad, de que\r\nseria muy servido, en cuyo nombre les pedio acudiesen a sus obligaciones;\r\ny para esto Don Pedro Tello tomo a su cargo la defensa del puerto.\r\n\r\nEl Obispo offreçio de deçir el otro dia una misa y una platica ala\r\ngente, como lo hiço, christianamente encargandole el serviçio de Dios y\r\nde su rey, y siempre continuo este officio de noche y de dia visitando\r\nlos puestos donde la gente estava, puniendo en cada uno un saçerdote y\r\nanimandolos con mucho exfuerço.\r\n\r\nEste dia el governador y general despacharon un barco con aviso a sancto\r\nDomingo para que se pusiesen y estubiesen a la mira por si el enemigo\r\nyba alla como se entiende y se le escrivio al Presidente, que luego\r\navisase lo mismo a Cartagena y a Sancta Maria.\r\n\r\nLuego se hiço muestra de toda la gente de la tierra, y parte de la que\r\navia en las fragatas se desembarco por ser necesario para la tierra;\r\nallose en todo a 10,300 personas y en estos 700 de pelea y los 800\r\nde fragatas y capitana de tierra firme, y las demas del presidio y\r\nforasteros, en los quales avia 50 de a cavallo con lança y adarga, que\r\ntodo se repartieron en la forma siguiente:\r\n\r\n    En la caleta del morillo el Capitan Pedro de Guia del\r\n      avito de San Juan, con ciento cinquenta soldados                150\r\n\r\n    En la caleta del cabron, Alonso de Vargas con cien soldados       100\r\n\r\n    En la puente y boqueron, Pedro Vazquez Alferez con ciento\r\n      y cinquenta soldados                                            150\r\n\r\n    En las fragatas, trecientas personas a orden de Don Pedro Tello   300\r\n\r\n    En el voca de vayamon, el capitan Otega con cinquenta soldados     50\r\n                                                                      ---\r\n                                                                      750\r\n\r\nToda la demas gente esta en el morro y en la plaça de Armas a cargo del\r\ncapitan Marco Antonio Veçerra y la de a cavallo al del governador, para\r\nacudir los dos cada uno con la de su cargo, a la parte mas combiniente y\r\nque mas neçesidas tubiese de socorro.\r\n\r\n    ARTILLERIA PLANTADA.\r\n\r\n    En el morro, veinte y siete pieças de bronçe muy buenas            27\r\n\r\n    En la plata forma del otro morro, çinco pieças                      5\r\n\r\n    En sancta elena, quatro pieças                                      4\r\n\r\n    En la caleta de los frayles junto a la fortaleça, tres pieças       3\r\n\r\n    En la caleta de sancta catalina, çinco pieças                       5\r\n\r\n    En el tejar, nuebe pieças                                           9\r\n\r\n    En la boca de vayamon, dos pieças                                   2\r\n\r\n    En la puente y en un navio que alla se puso, seis pieças            6\r\n\r\n    En el boqueron, quatro pieças                                       4\r\n\r\n    En la caleta de cabron, dos pieças

                                                 70\r\n\r\ny las fragatas bien artilladas; sin las quales avia las dhas setenta\r\npieças de artilleria plantadas y buenos artilleros en cada puesto y por\r\nsobreestante de los fuertes del morro y morillo de sancta Elena, el\r\nAlmirante Gonçalo Mendez de Canço.\r\n\r\nA los 15 del dho llego aviso dal governador de Canaria despachado al\r\nde aqui, para que supiese como la armada enemiga avia pasado por alli\r\ny aviendo echado alguna gente en tierra para haçer agua, le avian echo\r\nretirar con daño de veinte y çinco personas, y que venia la buelta de las\r\nyndias; y el dho aviso dijo como al pasar por la ysla de san Martin avia\r\nvisto surta la armada con veinte y çinco velas.\r\n\r\nLuego el dho dia el General Sancho Pardo despacho el mismo al governador\r\nde la Avana y le escrivio avisase a nueva España al general Pedro\r\nMelendez que estava alla con su flota. Estando echas todas estas\r\npreventiones toda la gente deseosa de verse con el enemigo, entraron\r\nen consejo el dho general y Don Pedro Tello, y el Almirante Gonçalo\r\nMendez y los capitanes Marco Antonio Veçerra, Pedro de Guia, Domingo\r\nde Ynsaurraga, el vehedor Martin Vomero de Caamaño, y aviendo tratado\r\nsi seria bien embarcar la plata en dos fragatas, para que en caso que\r\nel enemigo se pusiese sobre el puerto, como mas lijeras se pudiesen\r\nescapar de noche, siguiendoles las otras tres en reta guardia, para que\r\nsi se ofreçiese quedasen peleando y las dos siguiesen su viage; los\r\nmas Votos conformaronse enque no se mudase la plata de donde estava,\r\nporque seria desanimar la gente de la tierra que estava con animo de\r\ndefenderla peleando, y viendo que los desemparavan sedesanimarian y su\r\nMagestad perderia la tierra y su reputacion, enque le iba a deçir mucho\r\nmas de lo que le importava la plata; que lo que conbenio era haçer\r\nrostro al enemigo confiando en Dios que nos daria victoria; y visto por\r\nel general la mayor parte de los pareceres, ordeno a Don Pedro Tello\r\nque con diligencia aprestase las fragatas, para quando lo estubiese y\r\ncombiniese embarcar la plata se hiçiese, en el entretanto que el enemigo\r\ndaria muestras de si por si estubiese esperando al passo, mando fuese una\r\ncarabela la buelta de la mar 50 leguas a descubrir; y ansi se hiço y la\r\nplata se estubo queda que fue bien açertado.\r\n\r\nMiercoles 22 del dho mes de Nobiembre al amaneçer se descubrio la armada\r\nenemiga a la vista de tierra con 23 velas y una carabela latina, las\r\n6 galeones de la reyna de 800 toneladas, y dos naos del mismo porte y\r\nlos demas navios de 300, y de 150, y de ayavajo y 40 lanchas venian\r\nnavegando bien recogidas. Luego se toco a arma y cada qual acudio a su\r\npuesto con mucha alegria y buen animo de pelear. El viento era poco y\r\nasi venia con espacio asta que entro la briça. Venia delante la carabela\r\nlatina y algunas lanchas soldando la costa con vanderas blancas en señal,\r\ny llegandose una enfrente del boqueron, le tiraron de alli con una\r\npieça que la hiçieron retirar a la mar y luego pusieron otras vanderas\r\ncoloradas; y pasando delante despues del medio dia, dio fondo toda\r\nla armada enfrente de la caleta del cabron donde jamas se vio surgir\r\nningun navio por ser costa y donde no se savia que se podia dar fondo\r\nasta despues de ser ydo el enemigo, que embio el general a sondar la\r\nparte donde estubo y se allo de 20 a 30 braças en limpio, y segun lo\r\nque se entendio era su fin echar alli gente de vajo de su artilleria,\r\npareçiendole allarnos desaperçevidos y que no ubiese ninguna muestra que\r\nse le resistiese el paso, y allose engañado.\r\n\r\nEstando junta la dha Armada en la parte que digo, los nuestros le tiraron\r\nmuchas pieças de artilleria del morrillo y de la caleta del cabron, tanto\r\nque algunas valas le hiçieron dano por lo que despues que se supo que le\r\nmataron a Juan Aquines, general de la una esquadra y a dos caballeros de\r\nlos principales que con el venian y otra gente, y que a Franᵒ. Draque le\r\nllevaron la mesa en que estava comiendo y la bala dio a un personage que\r\ncon el venia que se supo no escapara.\r\n\r\nViendo el enemigo el dano que de tierra se le haçia, embio la carabela\r\nlatina con un piloto ysléno de naçion mulato que dicen es muy platico\r\nen estas partes, llevando consigo cinco lanchas la buelta del puerto\r\na reconeçerle y a sondar junto la boca del ysloto que llaman ysla de\r\nCabras, que esta a la vanda del oeste, y despues de aver fondado volvio\r\nla una lancha a dar aviso a la armada, la qual se desalojo luego de alli\r\na las cinco de la tarde, sin aver tirado pieça ni un solo mosquete en\r\ntodo el tiempo que alli estubo, y se fue buelta de la mar, y de una y\r\notra se andubo aquella noche asta otro dia.\r\n\r\nJuebes siguiente a las ocho de la mañana fue a surgir toda la armada al\r\nsocayre del yslote que el dia antes avian soldado junto al puerto, que\r\nfue otro nuebo surgidero no conoçido asta entonçes por ser fondo de 60\r\nbraças sobre bajos subjeto a que con qualquiera tiempo de braveça se\r\npudiera perder en la costa. Alli estubo siendole el tiempo favorable, sin\r\npoder la alcançar nuestra artilleria, y aquella tarde embio dos lanchas a\r\nasondar la playa de vayamon asta la estacada del carivelo y a reconeçer\r\naquellos vajos para ver si por alli podria echar gente en tierra, y en la\r\nuna lancha bein entoldada fue Franᵒ. Draque por lo que despues se supo.\r\n\r\nVisto por Don Pedro Tello, a cuyo cargo estava el puerto, las diligencias\r\nque el enemigo haçia, y pareciendole que avia de acometer por la estacada\r\ndel carivelo rompiendola aquella noche con lanchas para echar gente en\r\ntierra, acudio al general a dar le quenta dello, y a pedirle gente para\r\nque fuesen a defender a quel paso, y el general ordeno que aquella tarde\r\nestubiese alli el capitan Agustin de Candecho con 30 soldados y que a la\r\nnoche fuesen 50 soldados a cargo del vehedor Martin Vomero de Caamaño,\r\ncon orden de que si la fuerça del enemigo fuese superior, se retirase con\r\nla gente en los barcos a las fragatas para haçerse fuertes en ellas.\r\n\r\nEl dicho jueves 23 dia de San Clemente a las 10 de la noche con la\r\nobscuridad acometio el enemigo al puerto con 25 lanchas y en cada una de\r\n50 a 60 personas bien armadas con fin de quemar las fragatas segun lo que\r\nse vio, y todas entraron arrimadas a la plata forma del morro, metiendose\r\nde vajo de la artilleria, y segun lo que despues se supo, Franᵒ. Draque\r\nvino en la una asta la boca del puerto, a meter las demas, y aunque hacia\r\nobscuro se vieron las lanchas y luego començo a jugar la artilleria del\r\nmorro y del fuerte de sancta elena y las fragatas muy a priesa, y las\r\nmas de las lanchas embistieron con la fragata texeda Capitana poniendole\r\nfuego por la proa, echandole dentro muchas alcançias, bombas de fuego, y\r\nlos nuestros con mucha diligencia lo apagaron sin daño ninguno, peleando\r\ncon artilleria, mosqueteria, piedras, y al mismo tiempo pusieron fuego a\r\nla fragata sancta ysabel y a la fragata Magdalena y a sancta clara, el\r\nqual se apago; y la tercera vez que se encendio en la fragata magdalena\r\nde que era capitan Domingo de Ynsaurraga, no se pudo apagar, por averse\r\nencendido por popa con mucha furia, y todo lo que dio lugar a poder estar\r\nen ella y pelear lo hiço el dho capitan y la gente que con el se allo,\r\nastaque estava ya casi quemada y muertas 12 personas de la mosqueteria\r\ndel enemigo, y otras tantas que se quemaron; y el dho capitan se escapo\r\na nado por medio de las lanchas, y se fue a la fragata sancta Ysabel que\r\nestava a cargo del capitan Juan Flores de Rabanal en lugar del capitan\r\nPedro de Guia que tenia un sitio de tierra a su cargo, y alli ayudo\r\na todo lo que se ofreçio. Duro el pelear una hora la mas reñida que\r\nsea visto, y con el fuego de la fragata que se quemo, aclaro todo el\r\npuerto de manera que fue bien para las demas que se veian para asentar\r\nnra artilleria y la de los fuertes, con la quel y con la mosqueteria y\r\npiedras que de las fragatas se tiraron, les hicieron tanto daño que se\r\nretiraron acabo de una ora que como digo se peleava, con perdida de 9 o\r\n10 lanchas y mas de 400 personas sin otros muchos que fueron heridos;\r\nno aviendo de nuestra parte mas de la perdida de la fragata y quarenta\r\npersonas muertas y quemadas, de la mosqueteria algunos heridos. Fue\r\nmuy de ver lo bien que las fragatas pelearon y quan bien les acudio el\r\nartilleria de los fuertes particularmente el de sancta elena que estava\r\nmas amano para ofender las lanchas.\r\n\r\nViernes 24, considerando que el enemigo avia de asegundar aquella noche\r\ny que avia de echar gente en tierra, dende que amaneçio no çesaron\r\nprevençiones por nuestra parte, plantando artilleria en algunos puertos\r\nde tierra como fue en todo el tejar, que estava a cargo del governador\r\ny del Capitan Marco Antonio con la gente del cuerpo de guardia; en la\r\ncaleta de sancta Catalina se paso el capitan Guia que antes estava en\r\nel morrillo con 50 arcabujeros, y en la caleta de los frayles junto a\r\nla fortaleça otros dos pieças y 30 soldados a cargo del vehedor Martin\r\nVomero, y en todas partes se hiçieron muchas trincheras y fortificaçiones\r\ntrabajando cada qual con el açadon en la mano, sin que hubiese negro que\r\na ello ayudase, porque todos los veçinos los embiaron al monte con sus\r\naciendas y mugeres luego que asomo el enemigo.\r\n\r\nToda via como a las 8 de la mañana con el terral se levo la armada\r\nenemiga buelta a la mar procurando ponerse a barlobento del puerto, y\r\nansi andubo asta la tarde y pareçiendole a Don Pedro Tello que esto era\r\npara entrarse de golpe en el puerto, fue a tierra a deçirle al general\r\nque le pareçia que el enemigo se venia derecho al puerto, y que con los\r\ndos naos que se avian echado a fondo, no estava del todo çerrado la canal\r\ny que combenia echar dos fragatas en la parte que estava libre para\r\nque del todo se ympidiese la entrada, pues era de tanta importancia a\r\nsegurar el puerto que las dos fragatas por muchas considerationes y bien\r\ndel serviçio de su Magestad.\r\n\r\nEl general Sancho Pardo hiço luego junta del governador y de mas\r\nministros, y luego acordaron que se hechase una fragata a fondo en la\r\ncanal a caso que no bastase un navio de Pedro Sedeño que estava cargado\r\nde mercadurias y otro de menos porte, los quales se echasen luego como\r\nestavan, pues el brebedad del tiempo no daba lugar a la descarga, y que\r\nla fragata se echase quando el dho Don Pedro le pareçiese combenir.\r\n\r\nA las 4 de la tarde venia el enemigo con la briça caminando açia el\r\npuerto y creyendo Don Pedro Tello que venia derecho a el, echo a fondo\r\nlos dos navios de Sedeño y Juan Diaz de Sancta Aña, y la fragata\r\ntejeda, sin que la brebedad del tiempo diese lugar a sacarle todos los\r\nbastimentos y artilleria, aunque alguna parte se saco, y con esto se\r\nçerro toda la entrada de la canal, y el enemigo a la oraçion surgio entre\r\nel morro y la ysla de cabras donde estubo surto la noche antes.\r\n\r\nVisto que la armada estava surta y mas cerca de la entrada del puerto, se\r\nvolvio a confirmar la sospecha que se tenia de que aquella noche avia de\r\nprocurar acabar de quemar las fragatas y echar gente en tierra: Don Pedro\r\nTello con acuerdo del general hiço retirar las tres fragatas el puerto\r\nadentro, y las metieron en el tejar con gente de guardia por asegurarlas\r\ny no temiendo que echasen gente en tierra, viendo quan bien dispuestos\r\nestavan los animos de los nuestros y todos los sitios y desembarcaderos\r\natrincherados y fuertes; y el retirar las fragatas fue ya de noche quando\r\nel enemigo no lo pudo ver, y ansi el otro dia por la mañana entendio que\r\ntodas las avia echado a fondo aquella noche, se estubo sosegado sin haçer\r\nninguna demostraçion por nuestra parte si bien estubimos a la mira.\r\n\r\nSabado 25 luego de mañana embio el enemigo siete o ocho lanchas a\r\nreconoçer el puerto y toda la costa asta el boqueron, desbiandose de\r\ntierra porque nuestra artilleria no los ofendiese y a las 10 de la mañana\r\nvolvieron a recojerse a la armada que estava junta en la parte dicha.\r\n\r\nEste dia a las dos de la tarde asomo nuestra carabela que avia ydo ocho\r\ndias antes a descubrir el enemigo, y como por los nuestros fue vista le\r\ntiraron una pieça del boqueron para que se recojiese sin yr al puerto,\r\ny de la armada le siguieron algunas lanchas asta la playa de cangrejos\r\ndonde baro y parte de la cavalleria acudio a socorrer la gente, y Franᵒ.\r\nGonçalez que venia por piloto y capitan de la dha carabela le saco un\r\nrumbo porque el enemigo no la llevase y ansi las lanchas se alargaron y\r\nse bolvieron sin açer pressa.\r\n\r\nEl dho sabado en la noche se hiço a la bela toda la armada sin ser vista\r\ny se fue a la mar, y viendo los nuestros a la mañana que no parecia, se\r\nembio luego personas por tierra prolongando la costa del oeste, para\r\nque viesen si pareçia o avia pasado por alli, como se entendia, y yba a\r\nSancto Domingo.\r\n\r\nLunes volvio un aviso del Arracivo catorçe leguas deste puerto, diçiendo\r\nque la armada avia pasado por alli su camino adelante. Este dia despacho\r\nel governador otro aviso a San German, el qual bolvio dentro de seis dias\r\ncon nueba de que la armada estava en el butiro de la açucar la otra vanda\r\nde San German, y que avia echado en tierra cinco compañias de piqueros y\r\nmosqueteros que estavan açiendo carne, agua y leña, y quatro lanchas los\r\nquales hiço en quatro dias por traer lo mas echo.\r\n\r\nAviendo el general visto estos avisos y pareçiendole que podria ser odio\r\ndel enemigo, y que de alli podria ponerse al monte en espera de las dhas\r\nfragatas, o querer que fuesen ydas para volver sobre puerto rico por\r\nallarle sin fuerça para apoderarse del y executar el designio que traya\r\nde fortificarse en el, toco a cuerdo de lo que se aria, y se resolvio que\r\nno se saliesen del puerto asta saver de cierto que el enemigo hubiese\r\npasado adelante de la punta de la Aguada, y que fuese el Capitan Juan\r\nFlores de Rabanal con un pataje 70 v 80 leguas la buelta del norte a\r\ndescubrir, y que se embarcase la plata en el entretanto, el qual volvio a\r\ncabo de ocho dias sin aver visto nada.\r\n\r\nA nueve de diciembre vino aviso de San German que la armada enemiga era\r\nyda la buelta del Sur.\r\n\r\nA once del dho llego asta çiudad Lope Sanchez contramaestre de la fragata\r\nMagdalena y quatro marineros della, que la noche del yncendio de las\r\nfragatas los prendieron en el agua las lanchas del enemigo.

Estos\r\nçertificaron la muerte de Juan Aquines y el sentimiento que por el se\r\nhiço y el mucho daño que los enemigos reçivieron, tanto que pasandolos un\r\ndia de la capitana a otro galeon, allaron casi la gente del toda herida\r\ny maltratada, y que se quejaban del daño que las piedras que les tiraron\r\nde las fragatas les hiço, y que fue tanto el mal que el otro dia de la\r\npelea Franᵒ. Draque hiço consejo sobre si segundaria, no hallo ninguno\r\nque fuese de su pareçer, y mas por averles dhos estes hombres que era\r\nmucha la fuerça que teniamos mas de la que a sido; y que el Draque se\r\nquedo esbentado quando supo la poca gente que se hallo en las fragatas\r\nla noche del fuego, y se tiraba de las barbas por no aver tomado la\r\nplata y la tierra, no se dejando ver aquellos dos dias, quejandose de\r\nJuan Aquines que no quiso que vineran tras las fragatas de la ysla de\r\nGuadalupe luego que supo que le avian cojido el navio y venian a puerto\r\nrico, dando a entender que no tubieramos lugar de fortificarmos como se\r\nhiço en los ocho dias que se tardaron en aprestar sus lanchas y en haçer\r\nagua. Todo lo a ordenado Dios a quien se debe dar muchas graçias, pues\r\nmediante su labor de mas de aver alcançado una victoria tel, con tan poca\r\ngente como de nuestra parte hubo resistiendo la fuerça de una armada tan\r\npoderosa, defendiendo la tierra y dos millones de plata, a su Magestad\r\nselea seguido notables serviçios y a los particulares bien general.\r\n\r\nLo primero, que por lo que sea entendido el enemigo traya fin de\r\nsustentar esta fuerça y fuera le facil con poca costa, porque los\r\ncosarios que andan en esto de todas naçiones seacojieran a ella y ellos\r\nayudara a defenderla, y fuera menester armar muy de proposito para\r\nbolverse la a ganar, por ser el serviçio del puerto fuerte y de donde mas\r\ndaño pueden haçer a yslotas y costas que todo lo tiene a sotavento.\r\n\r\nLo segundo, que a este enemigo, que asta oy nadie lea echo resistençia en\r\nla mar, aqui se le rompio la caveça, pues como esta dho, una de las dos\r\nque governaban murio y 400 personas y hubo muchos heridos.\r\n\r\nLo 3, que se escaparon dos millones de plata y oro y granas con que la\r\nReyna podia armar y entretenerse por mas ynquietar nos.\r\n\r\nLo 4, que con averse entretenido en estas yslas asta los 3 de Diçiembre,\r\ndio tiempo a que sepuedan aver prevenido los lugares sospechosos con los\r\navisos que esta dho sedespacharon a Sancto Domingo y a la avana, y destos\r\nlos avian tenido en Cartagena y nueba espana con que podemos esperar\r\nseguridad.\r\n\r\nLo ultimo, y no demenos consideraçion es el animo y reputaçion que los\r\nnuestros an cobrado, reconoçiendo el poco valor de los enemigos, y por el\r\ncontrario la opinion que ellos an perdido, en que consiste mucha parte\r\nde los buenos o malos subçesos, y pues desta se siguen tantos viénes, su\r\nMagestad debe haçer merced a los que en el se allaron para que los que\r\nestan a la mira se animen a servirle en semeyantes ocasiones.\r\n\r\nPasada esta como esta dho, y aviendo el general tenido aviso que el\r\nenemigo yba adelante, y que los vastimentos eran pocos por averse gastado\r\nmuchos en esta ocasion, y ser la miseria desta ysla tal que no se podian\r\nproveer otros, y que combenia abreviar la partida de sudespacho, y ordeno\r\nque con suma presteça se recojiese el artilleria de los puestos de tierra\r\ny se embarcase la plata en los fragatas, y con ellas y con un navio y\r\nun patache en que se embarco parte de la gente y artilleria de las dos\r\nfragatas perdidas y de la capitana de tierra firme, partio de puerto rico\r\ncon buen tiempo a los 20 de Diçiembre de 1595.\r\n\r\n    INSTRUCCION que dio Franᵒ. Draque, al capitan del navio\r\n    Françes, uno de los de su armada que se le tomo en la ysla de\r\n    Guadalupe.\r\n\r\n    La instrucçion y orden que a de tener toda la armada que sale\r\n    del puerto de Plemua desde 29 de Agosto de 1595 años.\r\n\r\n    1. Primeramente es para servir a Dios y tener esta orden dos\r\n    veçes aldia y sino fuese alguna ocasion no poder mas.\r\n\r\n    2. Lo segundo aveis de tener gran cuidado de tener compania y\r\n    venir a hablar a vuestro Almirante dos veçes aldia, y quando\r\n    no pudieredes mas de una vez, lo haçed cada dia y tened gran\r\n    cuidado de la orden que vos sera dada de guardarla y tener\r\n    siempre estar en compania como el tiempo ordenare.\r\n\r\n    3. Y si fuese algun navio o patache per tempestad de tiempo o\r\n    per otra ocasion que hubiese y se apartase de la compania anos\r\n    de allar primeramente en la ysla de Bayona de Galicia y alli\r\n    estara la armada aguardando asta que el tiempo provea otra cosa\r\n    y nos allareis, y de alli sino nos allaredes, yreis a Puerto\r\n    Sancto y nos aguardareis alli tres dias, y sino fueremos alli,\r\n    tomareis el camino para la ysla de Guadalupe, una ysla pequena\r\n    de la vanda del nordeste çerca de la Dominica, en la qual\r\n    estaremos tres dias y dejaremos alguna sinal para que sepais\r\n    donde nosotros fueremos el qual sera para puerto rico; alli\r\n    estaremos diez dias.\r\n\r\n    4. Si en este camino tubieremos algun viento contrario e\r\n    tempestad de noche, aveis de amaynar todas los belas asta la\r\n    mañana, sino vieredes que una almiranta aga bela y ansi areis\r\n    vosotros lo mismo.\r\n\r\n    5. Y si el tiempo volviese de noche alguna contrariedad de\r\n    vento contrario, vuestra almiranta pondra dos lanternas, una de\r\n    vajo de otra de statura de un hombre, para que os vais regiendo\r\n    por ellas.\r\n\r\n    6. Y si todos nosotros amaynasemos de noche por alguna ocasion\r\n    de tempestad y fuese neçesario haçer vela esa noche, aveis de\r\n    ençender antes que nosotros echemos vela una sola lanterna con\r\n    lumbre en popa y otra en la gavia del trinquete.\r\n\r\n    7. No tendreis ninguna lumbre en ningun navio sino solamente\r\n    la lumbre que estubiese en la aguia, y este con gran cuydado\r\n    que no pareçia, fuera de la Almiranta y por los ocasiones que\r\n    pueden venir del fuego, no aveis de traer ninguna candela ni\r\n    lumbre entorno del navio sino fuese con lanterna, y ni mas ni\r\n    menos aveis de tener gran cuidado con el fuego de la coçina.\r\n\r\n    8. Ningun navio baral ni patache no vaya delante de la\r\n    Almirante de noche y particularmente en tiempo de fortuna de\r\n    tempestad ni se ponga de vajo de los navios grandes pasando de\r\n    una parte a otra.\r\n\r\n    9. Y si algun navio de la flota por desgraçia perdiese algun\r\n    arbol mayor o verga o alguna bomba o otro aparejo alguno de\r\n    importançia, tiraran una v dos pieças conforme a la necesitad\r\n    que tubiese para que los otros navios le socorran con brevedad,\r\n    y que ningun navio se aparte della asta que se socorra,\r\n    conforme a la necesitad que se tubiese.\r\n\r\n    10. Y si algun navio de la flota perdiese su curso y topase con\r\n    otro algun navio, la señal sera que içaran y amaynaran la vela\r\n    de gavia tres veçes y ansi ara la otra para que se conosca.\r\n\r\n    11. No aveis de consentir jugar en el navio naypos ni dados por\r\n    muchas ocasiones que suelen suçeder de pendençias.\r\n\r\n    12. Aveis de tener grandissimo cuydado de conservar los\r\n    bastimentos, conforme a vuestra discreçion asta que reçivais\r\n    otra orden de lo que aveis de hacer.\r\n\r\n    13. Lo ultimo para que agais mejor compañia, vereis una lumbre\r\n    en la popa Almiranta una o dos veçes.\r\n\r\n                                                     FRANᵒ. DRAQUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] For hallado, as _Avana_ (above) for Havana, _an_ (lower down) for\r\nhan, _avito_ for habito, &c.\r\n\r\n[2] This ought, probably, to be 3000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF WHAT TOOK PLACE AT SAN JUAN DE PUERTO RICO, IN THE INDIES,\r\nWITH THE ENGLISH FLEET UNDER THE COMMAND OF FRANCIS DRAKE AND JOHN\r\nHAWKINS, ON THE 23RD NOVEMBER 1595.\r\n\r\n(_The Translation of the preceding document._)\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Sancho Pardo y Osorio having taken his departure from the Havana\r\nfor Spain on the 10th March of this year, in command of the Capitana of\r\nthe main-land fleet, under convoy of the armed fleet of Don Francisco de\r\nColoma, and having, in the course of the gale which blew in the chops of\r\nthe Channel on the 15th of the same month, in latitude 23° 30´, found\r\nhimself without a main-mast, and with tiller broken, while the ship,\r\nleaking much, and separated from the others, was no longer in a condition\r\nto prosecute the voyage, for the purpose of saving the lives of the\r\nthree hundred people who were on board, as well as two millions of gold\r\nand silver belonging to His Majesty and to private individuals; with\r\nthe advice and consent of the supercargo, Martin Vomero de Caamaño, and\r\nof the pilots and other persons of most experience on board, made for\r\nPuerto Rico, where he arrived, by a miracle, on the 9th April, and there\r\nhe landed the bullion, and deposited it in the fortress of the town.\r\nThe aforesaid general despatched immediately first and second advices\r\nto His Majesty, making known his arrival, in order that instructions\r\nmight be sent to him as to what he should do. And it appears that Divine\r\nProvidence (to whom many thanks are due), for its secret ends, permitted\r\nthe orders, which might have come beforehand, to arrive just at the time\r\nto save not only the bullion, but the island itself, and perhaps all the\r\nIndies, as will be seen further on.\r\n\r\nA few days after the aforesaid letters were despatched, the governor of\r\nthis island, Colonel Pedro Suares, received those of His Majesty, whereby\r\nhe was informed that a great fleet was fitting out in England for the\r\npurpose of seizing on this island in the course of the winter, as it was\r\nthought that at that season the inhabitants would be less upon their\r\nguard. When the general and the aforesaid supercargo learned the contents\r\nof these despatches, they joined in consultation with the governor and\r\nFrancisco Cid, captain of the infantry of this garrison; and having taken\r\ninto consideration and discussed the precautionary measures which ought\r\nto be adopted for the safety of the place and of His Majesty’s treasure,\r\nin order that, if the enemy should come, it might be out of his power to\r\nmake himself master of the whole, they all agreed on reconnoitering the\r\npositions and accessible points from which the enemy might approach, so\r\nas to throw people ashore; and also that the general should give orders\r\nfor planting some of the guns of his ship in the positions which he\r\njudged best, and for laying the vessel athwart the channel of the port,\r\nso that she might be sunk on the arrival of the enemy, and thus bar the\r\nentrance; as this was the quarter where there seemed most likelihood of\r\nattack and most risk, and where it was necessary to keep the people well\r\non the watch. These arrangements being made, the general remained in\r\nexpectation of His Majesty’s order to proceed on his voyage.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th November of this year, there arrived at this port, Don Pedro\r\nTello de Guzman, with the five frigates of His Majesty, in order that\r\nGeneral Sancho Pardo should embark in them His Majesty’s bullion, and\r\nso proceed to Spain, the post of Admiral of his fleet being filled by\r\nthe aforesaid Pedro Tello, who, after having delivered his despatches,\r\nrelated to the aforesaid general, how, coming here in the course of\r\nhis voyage, they had fallen in with two English ships at the island of\r\nGuadaloupe, which had parted company from the English fleet; and how\r\nhis Admiral, Gonzalo Mendez de Canço, had captured one of them and sunk\r\nher, after taking the Englishmen out of her; and that he, the aforesaid\r\nDon Pedro, going in pursuit of the other vessel, discovered nine sail of\r\nthe enemy’s fleet, and as soon as he descried them he tacked about and\r\ncontinued his voyage: and that the aforesaid English prisoners had stated\r\nthat thereabouts, on the southern side of the island of Guadaloupe, the\r\nQueen of England’s fleet was lying at anchor and preparing launches;\r\nthat it consisted of five-and-twenty ships, six of them Queen’s galleons\r\nof eight hundred tons burden, and two more of the same size belonging\r\nto private parties, the whole being divided into two squadrons, having\r\nfor generals, Francis Drake and John Hawkins; the former, with his\r\nlieutenant in command on shore, Sir Thomas Baskerville, directing the\r\ncourse to be taken, and the proceedings on land; and that the armament\r\namounted to three thousand infantry and ten thousand five hundred seamen\r\nwell supplied with guns; and that they were coming direct to Puerto\r\nRico, as appeared also from the instructions which were taken from the\r\ncaptain of the aforesaid English ship, in which he was ordered, in case\r\nhe should part company from the fleet by any mischance, to proceed to\r\nPuerto Rico, where they would wait for him ten days, and after that,\r\nwould leave orders for him where he was to go, without further revealing\r\ntheir intentions; and that in consequence of all this, the aforesaid Don\r\nPedro came, fearing that the enemy might have preceded him and already\r\ngot possession of the island; and since they had not yet come, he held\r\nit for certain that they would be down upon the port the next day; and\r\naccordingly it lay with the general to order his departure as it might\r\nseem expedient.\r\n\r\nWhen the general, Sancho Pardo, heard the statement made by the\r\naforesaid Don Pedro Tello and his admiral, Gonzalo Mendez; and inasmuch\r\nas that news reached him when he was confined to his bed by an illness\r\nunder which he had been suffering some days, he sent word to the Bishop\r\nand to the Governor, requesting them to come to him to meet the captains\r\nof the frigates,—Marco Antonio Becerra, head of the company of fusileers;\r\nand Pedro de Guia, of the order of St. John; and Domingo de Ynsaurraga;\r\nFrancisco Gomez, captain of this garrison; the supercargo, Martin Vomero\r\nde Caamaño, and Juan de la Vera, purser of the frigates. These having all\r\nmet together in his house, the general laid before them and submitted\r\nfor their consideration the account which he had of the enemy, and the\r\nbest means that offered for the security of the island and the bullion,\r\nsupposing that the enemy’s fleet was as great, and to be expected as soon\r\nas was said; and that the frigates absolutely required to have their\r\nrigging repaired and to take in wood and water, which, with embarking the\r\nbullion, would cause a delay of eight days at the least; and considering\r\nthat, whether they were so occupied or not, the enemy by reason of the\r\ninformation which that other ship that was seen could give him, that\r\nthese frigates were coming for the treasure, which was now known to be\r\nhere, might hope to seize it on the passage, or to make himself master of\r\nthe country and to fortify himself in it, with a view to the conquest of\r\nall the Indies, whence would ensue to His Majesty great injury and loss\r\nof reputation.\r\n\r\nAll were of one mind in thinking that the place ought to be strengthened\r\nwith the guns and crews of the ships, and that the Capitana de Tierra\r\nFirme and another ship belonging to Pedro Milanes, should be sunk in the\r\nchannel of the port, to shut the entrance, and that the bullion should\r\nnot be moved from the fort until it was seen what turn affairs would\r\ntake, as it appeared to be safer there, and in a position also, whence\r\n(if, for our sins, it should be so ordered) it might be more easily\r\nthrown into the sea, so that the enemy should not get it; and having thus\r\nresolved, they proceeded to carry into execution with great alacrity and\r\nzeal, night and day, every possible measure of defence.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sancho Pardo, as a person of great experience, and who had seen\r\nand examined the position and approaches of the place, assured Don Pedro\r\nTello and the others who came with him, that the loss of the place was\r\nout of the question if our people were only willing to fight and do their\r\nduty, and that it was only necessary to take good care of the port, so as\r\nto prevent the enemy’s fleet running into it at once; and that, for that\r\npurpose, it were as well to sink the two ships which had been agreed on,\r\nand on top of them, the frigates with their bows towards the sea to bar\r\nthe entrance, and that with this precaution the place was quite safe and\r\nalso the treasure of His Majesty, who, herein, would be well served, and\r\nin whose name he called on them to attend to their several duties; and\r\naccordingly Don Pedro Tello took under his own charge the defence of the\r\nport.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop offered to say mass the next day, and to preach a sermon to\r\nthe people, as he did in fact, exhorting them, in a Christian manner,\r\nto the service of God and of their king; and he persevered in the\r\nperformance of this office night and day, visiting the posts where the\r\npeople were stationed, placing a priest at each of them, and animating\r\nhis hearers with much zeal.\r\n\r\nThe same day, the governor and general despatched a barque with advices\r\nto St. Domingo, that the inhabitants of that island might set and keep\r\nthemselves on the watch; so that if the enemy were to go there, as\r\nwas heard and was written to the President, the information might be\r\nimmediately forwarded to Cartagena and Sancta Maria.\r\n\r\nAll the people of the island were immediately mustered, and some of those\r\nbelonging to the frigates were landed, being thought necessary for the\r\ndefence of the posts. The whole amounted to ten thousand three hundred\r\nsouls, of whom seven hundred were fighting men, besides the eight hundred\r\nbelonging to the frigates and the Capitana of the main-land, and the rest\r\nof the garrison, and foreigners, including, also, fifty on horseback with\r\nlance and buckler; the whole of whom were distributed in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n    In the curtain of the Morillo [battery], Captain Pedro de Guia,\r\n      of the order of St. John, with a hundred and fifty soldiers     150\r\n\r\n    In the curtain of the Cabron, Alonso de Vargas with a hundred\r\n      soldiers                                                        100\r\n\r\n    At the bridge and Boqueron, Ensign Pedro Vazquez with a hundred\r\n      and fifty soldiers                                              150\r\n\r\n    In the frigates, three hundred men under the command of Don\r\n      Pedro Tello                                                     300\r\n\r\n    At the mouth of the river Bayamon, Captain Otega with fifty\r\n      soldiers                                                         50\r\n                                                                      ---\r\n                                                                      750\r\n\r\nThe rest of the people occupied the Morro and the esplanade, under the\r\ncommand of Captain Marco Antonio de Veçerra and the governor, who led the\r\ncavalry; each of them to advance with his party to whatever point seemed\r\nto require his presence, or to stand in need of succour.\r\n\r\n    ARTILLERY PLANTED.\r\n\r\n    On the Morro [rock battery], twenty-seven very good brass guns     27\r\n\r\n    On the platform of the other Morro, five pieces                     5\r\n\r\n    In St. Helena, four pieces                                          4\r\n\r\n    In the curtain of the Friars, close to the fortress, three pieces   3\r\n\r\n    In the curtain of St. Catharine, five pieces                        5\r\n\r\n    In the Tejar [tile field], nine pieces                              9\r\n\r\n    At the mouth of the river, two pieces                               2\r\n\r\n    On the bridge and in a ship which was placed there, six pieces      6\r\n\r\n    On the Boqueron, four pieces                                        4\r\n\r\n    On the Cabron curtain, two pieces                                   2\r\n\r\n    On the curtain of the Morillo, three pieces                         3\r\n                                                                      ---\r\n                                                                       70\r\n\r\nBesides the frigates well armed, without which there were the aforesaid\r\nseventy pieces of cannon planted with good gunners at each post, and for\r\nchief commander of the forts of the Morro and the Morillo de Sta. Helena,\r\nthe Admiral, Gonçalo Mendez de Canço.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of the same month intelligence arrived from the governor of\r\nCanary, despatched to the governor of this island, to make it known that\r\nthe enemy’s fleet had passed by the former place, and having landed some\r\npeople for the purpose of watering, they had been forced to retreat with\r\nthe loss of five-and-twenty men, and had gone off towards the Indies; and\r\nthe same messenger stated, that in passing by the island of St. Martin,\r\nhe had seen the armada, of five-and-twenty sail, lying at anchor.\r\n\r\nImmediately, on the same day, the general, Sancho Pardo, sent the same\r\ndespatch to the governor of the Havana, and wrote to him to forward the\r\ninformation to New Spain to General Pedro Melendez, who was on that coast\r\nwith his fleet. These precautionary steps having been taken, and the\r\npeople being all eager to combat the enemy, the general held a council,\r\nat which were present, Don Pedro Tello; the admiral, Gonçalo Mendez;\r\nand the captains, Marco Antonio Veçerra, Pedro de Guia, and Domingo de\r\nYnsaurraga, with the supercargo Martin Vomero de Caamaño; and having\r\ntaken into consideration whether it were expedient to embark the bullion\r\nin two of the frigates, so that if the enemy should place himself before\r\nthe port, these being lighter, might effect their escape by night, the\r\nother three following them in the rear, in order that, if any attempt\r\nwere made upon them, they might stay behind fighting while the two\r\ncontinued their voyage; it was decided by the majority of votes, that\r\nthe bullion should not be removed from the place where it was lying,\r\nbecause the removal of it would tend to dispirit the people, who were\r\nfired with the thought of defending it: seeing their expectations foiled,\r\nthey would be dispirited, and His Majesty would lose the place and his\r\nreputation, which was to be valued much more highly than the bullion:\r\nand what it behoved them to do, was to face the enemy, trusting in God\r\nfor the victory. When the general saw how the majority inclined, he gave\r\norders to Don Pedro Tello to get the frigates ready with all convenient\r\ndespatch, that the bullion might be embarked whenever it was found\r\nexpedient to do so; the enemy, it was supposed, would afford indications\r\nof his intentions, if he had such, of watching for it outside; and he\r\ndirected that a caravel should cruise on the look out, about fifty\r\nleagues off the land. This was done accordingly, and the bullion remained\r\nas it was, which was the prudent course.\r\n\r\nWednesday the 22nd of the same month (November), at break of day, the\r\nenemy’s fleet was descried on the horizon, with twenty-three sail and a\r\npinnace. The six queen’s galleons of eight hundred tons, and two ships\r\nof the same size, and the rest, vessels of three hundred tons and of one\r\nhundred and fifty and less, and forty launches, came sailing in close\r\norder. Immediately every one snatched up his arms and ran to his post\r\nwith great alacrity, and well disposed for combat. There was but little\r\nwind, and so the fleet advanced but slowly till it entered the breeze.\r\nThe pinnace came first and some boats with white signal-flags sounding\r\nthe coast. One of them having come in front of the Boqueron battery, a\r\ngun was fired at it which made it stand off to sea, and they immediately\r\nhoisted other coloured flags and passed out; and in the afternoon the\r\nwhole fleet came and cast anchor in front of the curtain of the Cabron,\r\nwhere no one had ever seen a ship ride before, nor was it known that\r\nthere was good anchorage till after the departure of the enemy, when the\r\ngeneral sent to have the place sounded, and from twenty to thirty fathoms\r\nclear water were found there. From what was learned, it appears to have\r\nbeen his intention to land a force under the fire of his artillery,\r\nimagining that he should find us unprepared, and seeing no reason to\r\nbelieve that such a step would meet with resistance; wherein he was\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nThe fleet having arrived in the place above-mentioned, our people fired\r\nat it several pieces of artillery from the Morrillo and the curtain of\r\nthe Cabron, so that some of the shot took effect on them, for it was\r\nknown afterwards, that they killed John Hawkins, the general of one of\r\nthe squadrons, and two of the principal gentlemen who accompanied him,\r\nbesides other people; and that they carried away the table at which\r\nFrancis Drake was eating, the ball striking a gentleman who was with him,\r\nand who, it is known, will not escape.\r\n\r\nThe enemy perceiving how much loss he sustained from the shore, sent the\r\npinnace with a pilot, a native of the islands and a mulatto by race, who\r\nis said to be practically well acquainted with these coasts, with five\r\nboats to the port, to reconnoitre it and to sound close to the mouth\r\nformed by the islet, which is called Goat Island, which lies towards the\r\nwest; and when it was sounded, one of the boats returned with information\r\nto the fleet, which immediately weighed anchor, at five o’clock in the\r\nevening, without having fired a cannon or even a musket during all the\r\nwhole time that it was there, and ran out to sea, where it stood off and\r\non that night till the following day.\r\n\r\nThursday following, at eight o’clock in the morning, the whole fleet came\r\nand anchored on the windward side of the small island where they had\r\nbeen sounding the day before, close to the port; and this was another\r\nnew anchorage not known hitherto, and having six fathoms over shoals,\r\nwhere a vessel might be easily lost in any bad weather. There the fleet\r\nanchored, the weather being favourable, and beyond the reach of our\r\nartillery; and the same evening two boats were sent to sound the shore\r\nby the river Bayamon as far as the Carivelo stockade, and to examine\r\nthese shoals in order to see if it were possible to land a force in that\r\nquarter; and in one of the boats, which was covered closely with an\r\nawning, was Francis Drake, as was subsequently learned.\r\n\r\nWhen Don Pedro Tello, who had charge of the port, saw the pains the enemy\r\nwas taking, and perceived that an attack was about to be made that very\r\nnight on the stockade of the Carivelo, by forcing it with boats, so as\r\nto land a body of men, he sent to the general to acquaint him with what\r\nwas going on, and to ask for a reinforcement to resist such an attempt;\r\nand the general ordered that in the evening Captain Augustin de Candecho\r\nshould proceed thither with thirty soldiers, and that at night there\r\nshould be fifty soldiers under the command of the supercargo, Martin\r\nVomero de Caamaño, with orders that if the enemy’s force should prove\r\nsuperior, he should retreat with his men in boats to the frigates, in\r\nwhich their forces were to be concentrated.\r\n\r\nThe same Thursday, 23rd, St. Clement’s day, at ten o’clock at night,\r\nwhen it was quite dark, the enemy commenced an attack on the port with\r\ntwenty-five boats, each carrying fifty or sixty men well armed, with\r\nthe view of burning the frigates, as was afterwards seen, and they\r\nall entered close up to the platform of the Rock [battery], ranging\r\nthemselves under the fire of the artillery; and from what was learned\r\nafterwards, it appears that Francis Drake came in one of them to the\r\nmouth of the port to place the rest. Dark as it was, the boats were\r\nseen, and instantly the guns from the Rock and from the fort of Sta.\r\nHelena began to play as briskly as possible. Most of the boats attacked\r\nthe Capitana, the Texeda frigate, setting fire to her at the bow, and\r\nthrowing into her a quantity of fire-pots and shells, while ours\r\nsucceeded in extinguishing the flames before they had done any damage,\r\nthe fight being carried on with cannon, musquetry, and stones.\r\n\r\nAt the same time they set fire to the Sta. Ysabel and Magdalena frigates,\r\nand to the Sancta Clara, which was extinguished; but the third time that\r\nthe Magdalena frigate, of which Domingo de Ynsaurraga was captain, took\r\nfire, it was impossible to extinguish the flames, as the ship took fire\r\nat the stern and burned furiously; and all that could be done to maintain\r\na footing on board, was done by the aforesaid captain and the people with\r\nhim, until the ship was just burnt down and twelve men were killed by the\r\nenemy’s musquetry, besides as many more burnt. And the aforesaid captain\r\nmade his escape by swimming through the midst of the boats and reached\r\nthe frigate Sancta Ysabel, which was under the command of Captain Juan\r\nFlores de Rabanal in place of Captain Pedro de Guia, who had charge of a\r\npost on land, and there he lent his assistance in every manner possible.\r\nThe battle lasted for an hour, the most obstinately contested that was\r\never seen, and the whole port was illumined by the burning frigate in a\r\nmanner favourable for the rest, who could thus see to point our artillery\r\nand that of the forts, with which, and with the musquetry and the stones\r\nthrown from the frigate, they did such effect, that the enemy, after\r\nabout an hour, during which the combat lasted, as I have said, retreated\r\nwith the loss of nine or ten boats and more than four hundred men,\r\nbesides many more wounded; while on our side, the only loss was that of\r\nthe frigate and forty men killed or burnt, besides a few wounded by the\r\nmusquetry. It was a fine sight to see how the frigates fought, and how\r\ncapitally they were backed by the artillery of the forts, particularly\r\nthat of Sta. Helena, which was in an advantageous position for playing on\r\nthe boats.\r\n\r\nFriday 24th. Considering that the enemy would assuredly repeat his\r\nattack at night, and endeavour to land his forces, the people on our side\r\nnever ceased, from the dawn of day, to prepare for resistance, planting\r\ncannon at some passes on land, as was done, for example, in the whole of\r\nthe Tejar, where the governor commanded, with Captain Marco Antonio and\r\nthe people forming the company of guards. Captain Guia, who previously\r\nkept guard in the Morrillo, now took his station in the curtain of Sancta\r\nCatalina with fifty arquebusseers; in the curtain of the Friars, close\r\nto the fortress, were two other pieces with thirty soldiers, under the\r\ncommand of the supercargo, Martin Vomero, and on every side numerous\r\ntrenches were dug and defences constructed, every one working spade in\r\nhand, and not a single negro to assist, for the people round about had\r\nsent off all their slaves to the mountain, with their effects and women,\r\nas soon as the enemy appeared.\r\n\r\nHowever, about eight o’clock in the morning, as soon as the land breeze\r\nsprang up, the enemy’s fleet weighed and stood to sea, endeavouring to\r\nget to windward of the port, and continued on this course till evening;\r\nand Don Pedro Tello perceiving that the object was to run at once into\r\nthe port, went ashore to explain to the general his apprehension that the\r\nenemy was about to bear down directly on the place: that the two ships\r\nwhich had been already sunk did not completely close up the entrance to\r\nit, and that it was expedient to sink two frigates in the part that still\r\nremained open, inasmuch as the complete barring of the entrance and the\r\nsecurity of the port were quite as important as the two frigates, for\r\nmany reasons, and for the good of His Majesty’s service.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sancho Pardo immediately held a council with the governor and\r\nother officers, and they decided that one frigate should be sunk in the\r\nchannel, in case that a ship belonging to Pedro Sedeño, which was lying\r\nthere laden with merchandise, and another of less size, should prove\r\ninsufficient; that these should be sunk immediately, just as they were,\r\nas there was not time to unload them, and that the frigate should be sunk\r\nwhenever Don Pedro thought proper.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock in the afternoon the enemy came running down with the\r\nbreeze towards the port, and Don Pedro Tello, believing that he was\r\nmaking directly for it, sank the two vessels of Sedeño and Juan Diaz de\r\nSancta Aña, and also the Texeda frigate, without being able, owing to\r\nthe short time allowed, to take out of them all the provisions and guns,\r\nalthough a part was saved; and thus the entrance of the channel was\r\ncompletely closed, and about vesper time the enemy came to anchor between\r\nthe Rock and Goat island, where he had lain at anchor the night before.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that the fleet anchored, and nearer than before to the\r\nport, tended to confirm the suspicion that the enemy meant to attempt\r\nthat very night to finish the burning of the frigates, and to land\r\npeople. Don Pedro Tello, therefore, with the consent of the governor,\r\nhad the three frigates brought back to the interior of the port, and\r\nthey were placed in the Tejar with a guard to secure them; but he had no\r\nfears about the landing of a force, seeing the spirit which animated our\r\npeople, and that all the posts and landing-places were well entrenched\r\nand strengthened. The removal of the frigates took place at night,\r\nwhen the enemy could see nothing, and consequently the next morning he\r\nconcluded that they had been all sunk. The night passed off quietly,\r\nwithout any effort on our part to shew that we were well on the watch.\r\n\r\nSaturday the 25th, as soon as daylight appeared, the enemy sent seven\r\nor eight boats to reconnoitre the port, and all the shore as far as the\r\nBoqueron. These kept at a distance from land, beyond the reach of our\r\nguns; and about ten o’clock they returned to the fleet, which remained at\r\nanchor in the place above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe same day, about two o’clock in the afternoon, our caravel, which had\r\ngone to look out for the enemy eight days before, came in sight, and as\r\nsoon as it was seen by our people, they fired a gun from the Boqueron\r\nto warn it to bear up without approaching the port; and some boats from\r\nthe fleet followed it as far as the Playa de Cangrejos (crab ground),\r\nwhere it ran ashore, and part of the cavalry hastened forward to assist\r\nthe crew; and Francisco Gonçalez, who was the pilot and captain of the\r\ncaravel, scuttled her, to prevent the enemy’s carrying her off; and so\r\nthe boats went away, and returned to the fleet without making a prize.\r\n\r\nThe same Saturday, at night, the whole fleet made sail without being\r\nseen, and stood out to sea; and when we found in the morning that it\r\nhad disappeared, people were sent by land westwards along the coast to\r\nascertain whether it was seen or had passed that way, as was supposed,\r\nand was going to St. Domingo.\r\n\r\nOn Monday news arrived from Arracibo, fourteen leagues from this port,\r\nthat the fleet had passed by on its course. The same day the general\r\ndespatched another messenger to San German, who returned within six days\r\nwith the information that the enemy’s fleet was lying in the Butiro de\r\nla Azucar on the other side of San German, and that they had landed five\r\ncompanies of pikemen and musqueteers, who were collecting supplies of\r\nmeat, wood, and water, and made four boats in as many days to carry their\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe general having received this intelligence, and thinking it likely\r\nthat there might be some artifice in the enemy’s movements, who perhaps\r\nmight be lying in wait hoping to catch the two frigates, or intending to\r\nreturn upon Puerto Rico when they should be gone and the place weakened,\r\nin order that he might seize it, and execute his design of fortifying\r\nhimself in it, seriously deliberated as to what should be done, and\r\ndetermined that the frigates should not quit the port till it was known\r\nfor certain that the enemy had passed Point de la Aguada; and that\r\nCaptain Juan Flores de Rabanal should go seventy or eighty leagues to the\r\nnorth with a patache to look out, while the bullion was in the meantime\r\nembarking. In eight days he returned, without having seen anything.\r\n\r\nThe 9th of December intelligence was brought from San German that the\r\nenemy’s fleet had gone away southwards.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of the same month there arrived at this place Lope Sanchez,\r\nboatswain of the Magdalena frigate, and four seamen of the same, who had\r\nbeen taken in the water by the enemy’s boats, the night the frigates\r\nwere set on fire. These men had been put on shore in the Butiro de la\r\nAzucar, with a letter of Francis Drake to the governor here, of which the\r\nfollowing is a copy:—\r\n\r\n    Letter of FRANCIS DRAKE to Colonel PEDRO SUAREZ, Governor of\r\n    Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\n    “Understanding that your lordship is a gentleman of rank and\r\n    a soldier, I write this letter to give you to understand that\r\n    whenever I have had an opportunity of dealing with the Spanish\r\n    nation, I have treated it with much honour and clemency,\r\n    liberating the individuals belonging to it, not a few, but\r\n    many in number. So, at the time when our people set fire to\r\n    the frigates, certain Spaniards were saved from the fury of\r\n    the flames, who, as conquered enemies, experienced from us no\r\n    ill-treatment, but the usage of honourable war.\r\n\r\n    “From them it has been learned that the capitana of Don Pedro\r\n    Tello took a small vessel of our fleet, having on board\r\n    twenty-five Englishmen, or more, treating them well, and as\r\n    might be expected in fair war. I myself still cherish my\r\n    former sentiments; but having another affair, strong deeds are\r\n    done, which never entered my mind. But as there are in this\r\n    place soldiers and gentlemen, I have no doubt that my people\r\n    will fare well, and will obtain their liberty for the sake of\r\n    honourable war: this I hope, and shall do the like myself. I\r\n    remain at your lordship’s service in all things, bating the\r\n    cause which is to be maintained as that of the flag of her\r\n    sacred Majesty the queen of England.\r\n\r\n                                                    “FRANCIS DRAKE.\r\n\r\n    “The 23d November 1595, English style.”\r\n\r\nFrom the information given by the aforesaid boatswain and the other\r\nseamen, who had gone with the enemy for eight days, it was ascertained\r\nthat the latter had departed thence towards the S. or S.S.W., and that\r\nthey were going to St. Domingo and thence to Panama, for they said that\r\nthey were going where there was a quantity of gold and silver; and the\r\nsame thing might also be inferred from the number of boats they took with\r\nthem for an armament.\r\n\r\nThese men confirmed also the death of John Hawkins, and testified as to\r\nthe regret occasioned thereby, as well as to the heavy loss which the\r\nenemy sustained. Thus, as a boat was passing one day from the flag-ship\r\nto one of the other galleons, it was struck, and nearly every man in it\r\nwas wounded. They stated that the enemy complained much of the damage\r\ndone by the stones thrown from the frigates; and that the loss was so\r\ngreat, that when Francis Drake held a council the day after the battle,\r\nto determine whether they should renew the attack, there was not one who\r\nagreed with him in favour of that proposition, especially as these men\r\nhad told them that our force was much greater than it used to be; and\r\nthat Drake was amazed when he learned how few people were on board of the\r\nfrigates the night of the fire, and plucked his beard [with vexation] for\r\nnot having taken the treasure and the place, not letting himself be seen\r\nthose two days; complaining of John Hawkins, who did not allow them to\r\npursue the three frigates from the island of Guadaloupe, as soon as it\r\nwas known that they had taken the vessel and were making for Puerto Rico;\r\nintimating that in that case we should not have had the opportunity of\r\nfortifying the place, as was done in the eight days which they spent in\r\nthe delay of preparing boats, and watering.\r\n\r\nAll this has been so ordered by God, to whom we owe many thanks, since\r\nby His means, besides obtaining such a victory, with so small a force as\r\nthat which on our side resisted the efforts of so powerful an armament,\r\nin defence of the place and two millions of treasure, important services\r\nhave resulted to his Majesty, and a general gain to private individuals.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as far as can be learned, it was the enemy’s\r\nintention to maintain this force, which he might easily do at small cost,\r\nfor the pirates of all nations who frequent these seas, would gather\r\nabout him, and would aid him in defending the position; and it would then\r\nbe necessary to fit out an expedition expressly to retake the place,\r\nsince the port has a decided advantage, and from thence much injury may\r\nbe easily done to the islands and coasts which are to leeward.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, this enemy, who up to this time has never met with\r\nany resistance at sea, has here had his head broken; since, as has been\r\nrelated, one of the two leaders died, with four hundred of his followers,\r\nand a great many were wounded.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we have thus saved two millions worth of gold, silver, and\r\ncochineal, with which the queen might equip and maintain a force to give\r\nus further trouble.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the delaying of the enemy in these islands till the 3rd\r\nDecember, allowed time for warning those places for the safety of which\r\nfears might be entertained, by means of the despatches which were sent,\r\nas has been stated, to St. Domingo and the Havana, whence others were\r\nforwarded to Carthagena and New Spain, so that we may now hope that all\r\nis safe.\r\n\r\nThe last, and not the least consideration, is, the spirit which our\r\npeople have shewn, and the renown which they have won, proving the\r\ninferiority of the enemy; and, on the other hand, the hold on opinion\r\nwhich the latter have lost, and in which consists to a great extent the\r\nsecret of good or ill-success. And since the beneficial results of this\r\naffair are so many, his Majesty ought to return thanks to those who took\r\npart in it, in order that the lookers-on may be encouraged to serve him\r\non like occasions.\r\n\r\nThis affair having passed over as here related, and the general having\r\nreceived information that the enemy was gone on, and that provisions were\r\nscarce, a quantity of them having been lost on this occasion, and the\r\npoverty of the island being such that the deficiency could not be made\r\ngood, and that it was necessary for him to abridge his delay as much as\r\npossible, gave orders to collect the guns with the utmost despatch from\r\nthe several posts on land, and to embark the treasure in the frigates;\r\nand with these, one ship, and a patache, in which were embarked part of\r\nthe crews and artillery of the two lost frigates, he left Puerto Rico\r\nwith good weather on the 20th December 1595.\r\n\r\n    The Instructions given by F. Drake to the captain of the\r\n    Francis, one of the vessels of his fleet, which was taken at\r\n    the island of Guadaloupe.\r\n\r\n    The Instruction and Order to be observed by the whole fleet,\r\n    which departs from the port of Plymouth on the 29th August 1595.\r\n\r\n    1. In the first place, omit not divine worship, and let this\r\n    order be observed twice a-day, unless no opportunity offers.\r\n\r\n    2. Secondly, great care must be taken to keep company and to\r\n    come to speak with your admiral twice a-day; and if you cannot\r\n    do it more than once, yet let it be done every day; and take\r\n    great care to observe every order given you, and to be always\r\n    in company, as the weather shall allow.\r\n\r\n    3. And should it happen that any ship or small vessel, through\r\n    stress of weather or other cause that may be, parts company,\r\n    they must look for us first of all in the island of Bayona, on\r\n    the coast of Galicia, and the fleet will wait till it is time\r\n    to proceed and you shall have found us; and thence, if you\r\n    should not find us, you shall go to Puerto Sancto, and there\r\n    you shall wait for us three days; and should we not be there,\r\n    you shall make for the island of Guadaloupe (a small island\r\n    near Dominica towards the north-east), where we will stay three\r\n    days, and will leave some signal that you may know what course\r\n    we shall have taken, which shall be for Puerto Rico; there we\r\n    will stay ten days.\r\n\r\n    4. If in the course of this voyage you meet with any foul\r\n    wind or bad weather, you must take in all sail at night till\r\n    morning, unless you see that one of your admirals carries sail,\r\n    in which case you shall do the same.\r\n\r\n    5. And if foul wind or bad weather should come on at night,\r\n    your admiral will hang out two lanterns, one above the other,\r\n    and the height of a man asunder, that you may steer by them.\r\n\r\n    6. And if we should all shorten sail over night on account of\r\n    the weather, and it be necessary to make sail the same night,\r\n    you must show, before we make sail, a single lantern with a\r\n    light at the bow, and another at the fore-top.\r\n\r\n    7. You shall keep no light in any of the ships, but only the\r\n    light in the binocle, and this with the greatest care that it\r\n    be not seen, excepting the admiral’s ship; and to avoid the\r\n    danger of fire, you must not bear about any candle or light in\r\n    the ship, unless in a lantern; and neither more nor less, you\r\n    must take the greatest care with the fire in the galley.\r\n\r\n    8. No vessel, square or cutter-rigged, should go ahead of the\r\n    admiral at night, particularly in rough weather; or get under\r\n    the lee of large vessels, in tacking from side to side.\r\n\r\n    9. And if any vessel of the fleet should lose, through\r\n    mischance, a main-mast, or yard, or any of the water vessels,\r\n    or anything else of importance, they shall fire one or two\r\n    shots, according to the necessity of the case, that the other\r\n    vessels may afford them speedy assistance; and take care that\r\n    no vessel quit that which is in distress till the required\r\n    succour be given.\r\n\r\n    10. Should any vessel of the fleet lose her course, and fall\r\n    in with another of the fleet, the signal shall be to hoist and\r\n    lower topsails three times; and the other vessel shall do the\r\n    same for recognition.\r\n\r\n    11. You must not permit any gambling in the ship, with cards or\r\n    dice, by reason of the numerous quarrels usually resulting from\r\n    that practice.\r\n\r\n    12. You must take the greatest care to save the provisions,\r\n    following your own discretion in this matter till you receive\r\n    another order for your guidance.\r\n\r\n    13. Finally, in order that you may be better able to keep\r\n    company, you shall see a light at the admiral’s stern once or\r\n    twice.\r\n\r\n                                                     FRANCIS DRAKE.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\nRICHARDS, PRINTER, 100, ST.
